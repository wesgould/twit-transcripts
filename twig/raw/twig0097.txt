[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.240]   Actually, we should call it this week in the four
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.560]   horsemen of the internet.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.760]   I'm horseman number one.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.560]   Here's horsewoman number two, Gina Trapani.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.760]   Horsewoman number two.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.960]   Horsewoman number two.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240]   That's your new title.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640]   Greetings, fellow horse people.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.000]   That's just straight out of the game of thrones.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.080]   The Calisi is here from smarterwear.org at Gina Trapani,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   also here.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080]   Ooh.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   Ooh.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   A cheesy transition.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   Fancy transition.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   Fancy transition, guys, in the house.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   Mr. Tash Gordon.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   Mr. Tash Gordon.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.600]   Yeah, I don't know how that happened.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.800]   I can do-- you want cheesy transitions.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.040]   I can do cheesy transitions.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.840]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   Whoa!
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Oh.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.640]   For those of you listening at home, you're not missing a thing.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.140]   No.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.160]   And we are about to talk about the Googler.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   So that was what Eric Schmidt called Facebook, Google, Apple.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   And Amazon.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.560]   And Amazon.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.440]   The four horsemen.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   I think that's accurate.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   I think so.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   You left out Microsoft.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   I think that's right.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   No Microsoft.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   And he left out Twitter.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.520]   Twitter's too small a service to be worth.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.440]   But it was companies creating a platform, right?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.120]   Companies who were doing a really good job exploiting the web as a platform.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.880]   So I think that Twitter isn't necessarily that yet.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.320]   But Amazon certainly is, right?
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.000]   So I think that was a pretty--
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.560]   Is Apple-- does Apple belong in there?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.880]   They're a great hardware manufacturer.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   But are they-- I guess with iCloud is--
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   iOS.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   It's the platform, right?
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.480]   iOS, too.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.560]   OK.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.040]   I mean, there's-- we're going to spend like three quarters of the show dissecting what
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.720]   Eric Schmidt said yesterday at the D9 conference.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.920]   The top 10 things, according to Danny Sullivan, that Eric Schmidt revealed at D9.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.240]   You know what?
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.600]   Just before we go into these, Jeff, Gina, you think Eric did himself a solid on the stage
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.320]   at D9 at D9?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   I think so.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.800]   You know, I watched a video that they put up, which was edited.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.560]   And I thought it was a really good interview.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   I thought that he was good.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   He was good.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   He was frank.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   I thought that his observations were astute.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   But it was interesting.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.800]   You know, TechCrunch, I guess, Sarah Lacey at TechCrunch said that he came off--
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   you know, he put himself down and he's got filled with regret for his time at Google.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.040]   I didn't get that at all.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   It's called honesty.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.880]   It's honesty and humility, both of which I think--
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   --the more CEOs show.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   Yes.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   Absolutely.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.000]   As we talk this through, he didn't get the commerce job that supposedly he was up for
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.960]   in the White House.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   But the discussion after Paris was that, you know, this is the political Eric and Eric
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   has a political ambition.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.360]   And people are starting to say, is he the first geek president?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.000]   You know, you put this kind of honesty you hear from him now against a politician's voice.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And I'd welcome that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I mean, he--
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He's interesting.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   --this is foot in his mouth.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.760]   But he's being direct and he's being smart.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.240]   I did notice a number of people on Twitter.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.160]   I was watching the live Twitter feed as he's speaking, which is always interesting.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.240]   And a number of people on Twitter said how political, how smooth and savvy he was appearing.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.440]   Which is not what he's usually accused of.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   No.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   Right.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   Creepy.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   Foot and mouth.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   Foot and mouth.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Right.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   OK.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.080]   So gang of four and platforms.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.360]   He says they have huge platforms, dominance in their spaces, difficult for others to challenge,
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.800]   Amazon rules in shopping, Apple for beautiful quote, beautiful products, Google for information,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.680]   Facebook in friends and identity.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.280]   Microsoft, not on the list.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.080]   He says he didn't see them driving the evolution of consumer products and services.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.240]   He said big in the enterprise space, that's for sure.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   And they have products that I thought this was actually a pretty astute analysis are
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.600]   a quote flywheel that would power Microsoft for decades.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.920]   Much like IBM went on and on after it lost dominance in the 50s.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   It went on and on and on and still goes on.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.840]   Number two.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.880]   Google did a deal with Apple to stay on the iOS platform with Google Maps and Google
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.440]   Search.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.480]   He says we have a very, very good search partnership and map relationship with Apple.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.400]   Deals have been renewed.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.360]   No other details.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.680]   I really thought Apple was one of the reasons this whole Apple privacy kerfuffle happened
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000]   is that Apple was gathering data to supplant Google.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.560]   And it was in fact, I think Apple even said that they were going to do a traffic application
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.640]   which implied a map application to me.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   Number three.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.840]   These are Danny's top 10.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.320]   Google will get social data in alternative ways.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.000]   They tried to do a deal with Facebook, the deal that Bing ended up doing to include social
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.720]   search.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.280]   I got the impression that they weren't able to make that deal.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.480]   He says from Google's perspective, it would be useful to have the information.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.280]   It would make our products better.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   Social search, the next big thing.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   Later when I asked.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.600]   You get Eli Pera's are going after him.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   You know, don't personalize.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.280]   I don't think it's wrong, but that's that's the new meat and starter bubble.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.200]   Thing, which we've talked about.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.600]   We talked about last week.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   And I think through it out.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   Out of hand, right?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   We dismissed it.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.280]   When asked if Google might need to buy something like Twitter, he said, "Our social strategy
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.360]   does not acquire the acquisition."
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.640]   I think he means require the acquisition of any company because we can't get people
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.600]   to give us that information.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.000]   He's talking about plus one.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.320]   Oh, because we can get.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.040]   So he says we can license it.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   I see.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   Right.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.360]   He's saying he can license it from other companies, but also Google can get people to give them
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.800]   give it personal information in other ways through profiles, through plus one, likes.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   Wow.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Right.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   I think this is him.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   This is how I interpret it.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   I think you're right.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   I think you're right too.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   I misinterpreted it.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.280]   I was thinking we could license that data like we tried to do with Facebook.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   No, you're right.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.720]   In other words, we don't need Facebook because we have means.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.880]   They know everything about it.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   So you can.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   I mean, Gmail really is a crux of that.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.080]   I mean, really Google does know a lot about you.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   It knows your contacts.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.640]   I mean, your email is a pretty personal thing.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.080]   They have to be careful though.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   That's right.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   That's a personal thing.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   Facebook, I'm willingly giving them information.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.440]   I don't want Google mining my Gmail.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   Agree.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   I mean, most people don't.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.560]   That's definitely true.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.000]   But your contacts is very, you know, that's a social graph that they take that.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But can they use that?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.400]   And that they misuse with buzz as we know.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.560]   But you know, plus one is another in which we'll talk about later on in the show.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.200]   But that's another way that that's, you know, that's their like button.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.800]   Both are so limited.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.680]   I mean, you know, part of what Zuckerberg said to me when I interviewed him for the book
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   was that the difference is that Google and companies like that scrape what goes on on
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.320]   Facebook, you choose to say it.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.840]   You know, the example he always gives is that is that you choose to say that you're a Green
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.120]   Day fan and there comes the ad for Green Day versus saying your email Green Day, Green
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.280]   Day, Green Day, Green Day.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.520]   And suddenly the ads there and that people find creepy, right?
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.360]   That there's an explicit choice that's true about Facebook and Google.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Definitely.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.120]   But the Green Day ads, we're seeing those already inside Gmail and that's private.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.520]   I mean, what Google has to do is distinguish very strictly between what's private, which
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.200]   is Gmail, you know, email and what you explicitly publish.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.600]   But Google's got plenty of publishing tools, right?
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.240]   I mean, Blogger, Buzz was a try, profiles.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.400]   I mean, there's a lot of little places where you can enter information about yourself.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.240]   Google read your subscriptions and your likes and your comments on those.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.400]   I mean, it's not Facebook, but it's kind of, it seems like instrument was referring to
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.280]   all these little ways here and there that you can add signals and publish and share.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   Google products.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.920]   Well, they're the best signal generator is the phone.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   Yes.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   Where you are, what you're looking for, what you're doing.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.200]   Who you're calling?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.760]   No.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.800]   But that is the issue is how do we use this data without creeping people out?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   Right.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.480]   You respect the stuff that's private.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.640]   That's meant to be private.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   Didn't he take some blame for Buzz, the Buzz fiasco yesterday?
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.160]   Didn't he mention that?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.880]   I can't remember.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   He took blame for a lot of things.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.320]   He, you know, I watched the edited version, so I didn't see the entire interview.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.800]   I don't think he mentioned Buzz specifically, but apparently he did say that, uh-
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.840]   I'm not good at, we're not good at social.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.400]   We screwed up social.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   Right.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   And that's his big regret, right?
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400]   Right.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   Is that he didn't need to have that?
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Right.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   He didn't need to have that.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   So, so, so they're saying this group of social now they're saying that they're going to
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.480]   get, you know, we have our ways to get social data.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.880]   Isn't quite convincing to me.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.040]   There's the issue of how they don't know how to do it, but be there's a creepy issue
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.360]   we were talking about too.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.280]   Um, I think they like a strategy still.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   But no, there's no apparent strategy.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.360]   We keep, we keep on, because they're Google and they're brilliant and they're amazing.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   We keep on giving them credit.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   Right.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   We give them a lot of credit.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.120]   Something in the lab, but it's coming out soon.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   Right.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   We keep on guessing what it is.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.520]   I think it's quite possible that they don't have any freaking strategy for some.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.840]   Aren't we close to the one year mark of the Google me rumor?
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   And still nothing.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   Right.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.280]   There is no me there.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:04.520]   Um, he says it was his fault that Google's social networking problem.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.480]   So does that imply that Larry Page might do a better job?
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.960]   Is he maybe saying it's, well, Larry's going to fix this?
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.480]   No, I think he's doing the opposite.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.600]   I think it's more of a fault by omission, a sin of omission that, that, that, yeah, he
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.360]   wrote the memos, but he didn't follow through.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   He didn't execute.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   He didn't make it happen.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   And so he's saying buck stops here.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   I screwed up.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Well, good.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   That's very presidential.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   Keep up the good weather.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.720]   Smith says he's dealing with external issues almost exclusively now since Larry took over
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   as CEO in April.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.280]   I think by that, he means Washington, right?
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.600]   Yeah, I think it's, it's mainly that.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.400]   Not Washington, but, but London, Paris, Bon, you know, pick your capital.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.520]   He was at EG eight.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.040]   Did he have a high profile there?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   Listen to Sarkozy.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:59.800]   He went with Sarkozy to doviu and the G eight alone with Mark.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   He is very much getting into government, isn't he?
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   Oh, he really is.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.680]   And I think that it's, it's, it's necessary for Google.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's hurt Google, especially in Europe and the EU.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.040]   And so they need the highest power and spokesman they can have in those circles.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.160]   And that's him.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.640]   And I think personally he's, he's into this now.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.400]   He kind of applied though that he would stay at Google till death did them part.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   Right.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.480]   He said that he's biggest worry about the web is that a balkanization of the web that
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.000]   every country will have its own internet.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.240]   I mean, that I thought was good.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   I liked that.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.280]   I was, yeah, I thought, I thought Jeff is, and his exploding right now.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   That's been years.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   That's been your, uh, it's so right.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.400]   I'm writing a post I haven't finished yet, but, but thinking about, you know, last week
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:13:00.280]   in Paris, um, the, the fight now was over the sovereignty, sovereignty of both the net
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   and governments.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   Right.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.360]   We say that government has no sovereignty.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.560]   So quote John Perry Barlow on the net and the government's kind of claiming that they
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.600]   should, but what makes the net, the net is that no one can have sovereignty over it.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   Right.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.160]   That's what, that's what scares governments to things like WikiLeaks.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.440]   Scares government is, is it, it can't.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.520]   And so, and so that's what it is.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.640]   And so what you really see, I think is government trying to, you know, try to reserve a place
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.160]   at the table in the future.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.080]   And there may not be a place for them.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.600]   And by the way, then it was.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.320]   And that's, and that's profoundly frightening.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.720]   And it leaves a vacuum as clacer.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.400]   He would say, we don't know what's going to fill the vacuum.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.480]   But I think that's what's going on here.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.520]   And so, so Eric last week, you know, said to them pretty clearly, he says this in various
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.800]   contexts around that government is slow.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   Technology is a lot faster.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.040]   Government shouldn't be holding things back.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:02.400]   By the way, that's why we, I mean, I think that the government is slow on purpose.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.880]   I think the founders wanted a government, were afraid of a government that was too efficient
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   and effective.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   I know I am.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.040]   So, so what the problem is when they do use the power to regulate, when they do define
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.360]   what the internet is before it's even done yet, you know, that's a danger.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:25.080]   And then, you know, when I, when I asked this question at, at Aspen two years ago, almost,
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.520]   he did a little solenoch way about, about how, you know, I wish the change happened
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.400]   faster like you say, Jarvis, but it's not.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.360]   The reason is not is because all the resources go to the incumbents, you know, that the big
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.600]   old companies and government are in a cabal together to prevent the change.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.480]   And so that's really kind of his view is that, is that it's change agents against change
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.120]   resistors.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.840]   I think now the next, you know, immediately you start going Google with its devil's deal
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.600]   with Verizon and his Google going, oh, is it jumping the shark in terms of being a big
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   company?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   That's a different discussion.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   But, but Eric's take has been that government is slow and it's a problem.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.960]   Well, now I'm scared about Eric, Eric getting to be president.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.400]   I would have speed things up.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.520]   The trains will run on time or or he would do the opposite or he would, you know, eliminate
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.960]   his own job.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.520]   Not quite.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.920]   When you see things like Bitcoin, which is an extra governmental currency fueled by the
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:37.040]   internet, WikiLeaks, which is an extra national in Jay Rosen's terms, journal, you know, news
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.440]   entity.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.160]   And I expect we'll see more and more of this.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.240]   It is kind of it feels very futuristic.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.720]   I know what's.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.960]   It's very, very cyber.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.120]   Go ahead, Jim.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   Neuro answer.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   Go ahead, Jim.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.160]   No, I was going to say it feels like the future.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.120]   It feels like, oh, right.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.880]   This is, this is what this is what it was meant to be for, right?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   The people to organize on a level that goes beyond beyond local government.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.000]   I mean, it has a lot of big, scary implications, which is probably more qualified than the
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   working on.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.920]   Well, one of the things, you know, science fiction talks a lot about is extra governmental
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.320]   corporations, you know, multinationals.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.920]   And that's a little scary.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.040]   And most science fiction says, well, it's these multinationals that will end up, you
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.520]   know, the world government by de facto.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   But interesting.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.720]   Maybe the internet will be a player.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   A peer.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.480]   Well, if the internet stays architected the way it is, then there is an entry point for
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   anyone.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.160]   We've got to get Timothy Wu on.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.600]   Yeah, we do.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   Because his book, The Masters, which that's what he talks about.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.440]   He says, you know, in the past, what's happened, and he uses the long distance system as an
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.520]   example, is these systems were created.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   They were open.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   They thrived.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.160]   They innovated as all open systems do, but it only, it was only for a while.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.680]   And then corporations came along and said, okay, thanks, kids.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.600]   We'll take it from here.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   And he fears.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   And he fears that's well, he doesn't fear.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.640]   He says it's going to happen on the internet.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.800]   And it's going to be taken over by internet companies.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.720]   So Facebook and Google or an Amazon are going to.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.200]   The Four Horseman, baby.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   Right.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.320]   Well, it's hard to feel like Apple is going to be.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.440]   I don't think Apple's one of the Four Horsemen.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.240]   But here's the thing.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.680]   If I'll go this far, if Sarkozy has a dream of how the internet should operate, it would
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.160]   be Steve Jobs's dream.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   Yes.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   It'd be controlled.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   You bet.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.680]   And GameStop and Gatekeeper.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.200]   GateKepstee says there's no porn on iOS.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Hey, right.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   We protect you.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   Right.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   Good point.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   That's our job.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   So I don't, I mean, I'm not sure I want Facebook to be in charge either.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.080]   But let's promote a healthy competition between Amazon, Google and Facebook.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.320]   You don't want anybody to become part of it.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   Well, part of it's argument too.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.280]   And every time Schmidt has argued is Google too big.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.040]   And of course, the responses show me too big and shouldn't be regulated more.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.080]   So Schmidt says, who do you, who would you prefer to run this?
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.640]   You know, Google or the government.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   Right.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   Well, Google.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.800]   Google, we're here to help.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   Although, I mean, I think people who believe in government as a reflection of the social
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.560]   contract would say government, that government reflects us in our desires.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   It's just, it's just such an imperfect.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   Right.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.880]   But the problem becomes when you have it slow and slow and it doesn't really reflect us
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   in our desires.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:36.520]   Well, Sarkozy said that only governments are the legitimate representatives of the people.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.560]   And in response to that is to rear square in Egypt.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   The issue now is that there's so much of what we do is not tied down to a nation.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.040]   But is it, but is it really?
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.800]   I mean, that is what a government is supposed to be anyway.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.160]   The ideal government is a reflection of the will of the people.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.640]   It's us self-governing.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.720]   Now, obviously, Egypt is not self-governance, but let's use the United States.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.080]   A republic isn't that the principle behind it is self-governance?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.880]   We elect representatives, but the idea is we're self-governing.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.880]   Right.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.080]   But Leo, what do you do about the financial structure that cuts across even America can't
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   do it all?
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.240]   What do you do about the ecological issues and, you know, pollution and radioactive?
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   So easy.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.120]   I would say this is what Tim O'Reilly kind of dreams of when he talks about government
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.600]   2.0 is that notion of a, maybe not extra national, although maybe it should be transnational.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.160]   But open, transparent government that does reflect the will of people, maybe the internet
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.280]   will become an, or somehow, foster?
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   Is this what you think?
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.480]   I think the idea of the future of the foster is a transnational government that reflects
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   the will of its people.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.000]   Well, government is a platform versus as a tool.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Right.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And that's what you're doing.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   That's what, think up is all of that.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Yeah, that's what that's what I'm talking about.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   That's what expo land is.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   So that's the one side of it.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That's good government.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.200]   But on the other side of that, watch out.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   I'm going to quote Habermas.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.240]   Is that what I think- We have a new Godwin's law.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   Every conversation.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.280]   It's no longer that we Google ourselves.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.240]   Habermas, I got to read this cat.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.280]   All covers though, you don't, oh God, no, you don't.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880]   It's like raw sausage, man.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   It is not digestible.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.400]   It was torture.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.520]   But, but- We have a Habermas drinking game, however.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.960]   I'm glad to say the chat room is already sloshed.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Ooh.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   Mmm.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.880]   So he argued that the public sphere emerged in the 18th century when in salons and coffee
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.040]   houses, the discussion, the rational critical debate of the people became, for the first
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.400]   time, a killer weight to the power of government.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.440]   And then he argues that it got corrupted by mass media, where we would just got talked
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440]   to again.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:49.120]   Well, I think what I argue in a certain book to come out in September is that what the
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.720]   internet is, Habermas was wrong because the coffee houses only had the twee rich people
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.440]   and only men and only landed people and it was not the people.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.640]   But the internet does have the power to be the people.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   And so the internet is a constant counterweight to government.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:14.240]   And so when government tries to regulate its disruptor, that's a conflict necessarily.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.360]   The internet is our public sphere.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   Oh, damn, I should say that in the book.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.360]   It's good.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   Revisions, revisions.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.960]   I got one chance left right now, but the internet is the public sphere.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.360]   The internet is it is.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.200]   It's the embodiment of the public sphere with all its own ruleiness.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.760]   And it's a, you know, heterogeneous, heterogeneity.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.800]   I was good.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   It's all mixed up.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   It's a bunch of mixed up stuff.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   Write that down.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   Are you running it down, Jeff?
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   Write it down.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   Write it down.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   It is the public.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   It's called a pen.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   I still use it.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.720]   And a little post.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.200]   It's a lot faster than a tablet.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   I could tell you that.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:01.680]   Oh, I put my post notes on to the pads here for the laptop you see here.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   Oh, so there you go.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680]   Right.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.440]   So that's why they have such a big wrist rest.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   Exactly.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.760]   The post note holder.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.080]   So I put notes there to remind myself they stayed up for six months.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.920]   I never read them, but it doesn't matter.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:20.080]   So we got to fight to keep the internet to be a true public sphere, a true, you know,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.480]   speaker's corner, a true Hyde Park, open free.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:32.840]   And I think internet as a platform where a government as a platform is a great way to
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.240]   think of it as well.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   Right.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.840]   That's what the people have to do is to demand that the government is a platform for listening
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.920]   to what they have to say and for implementing the things to represent.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.120]   Like representation via the internet, just not just through voting, but a constant kind
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.440]   of interchange and people participating all the time and using the internet very much.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.080]   But yeah, the government as a platform, that's the whole Gov 2.0 kind of vision.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.720]   And we just have to make it happen.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.200]   Create from Todolio, Habermas said to Chipotle watching Glee.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   Forget twigs.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.280]   Twig, we have to get a new acronym.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.160]   It's the Glee Chipotle Habermas Show.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.640]   Well, Kerry, that further career idea for that, I think you're right.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.040]   But in this future, then a quality company is also a platform.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.560]   Right.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.720]   When Google is at its best, Facebook is at its best.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   Zappos.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.600]   It is a platform for what we want to get done.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.280]   And that's when we have the best relationship with it.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.640]   That's when they can succeed.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   When they fail is when they try not to be that.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   Verizon.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   Right.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   Right.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   Verizon Google.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.360]   And this is the argument that Siva Badenathian says that companies must be evil because
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.520]   they must, I'm simplifying, they must return money to their shareholders.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.360]   And I, you know, Umi or Haik and I come back and argue, well, yes, but the cost of doing
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.680]   evil is higher now.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.800]   And so you may succeed better by being a true platform.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   Yes.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   And Google has mostly done that.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   Mostly.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.600]   Exactly.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   Yes.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.560]   And so you take Schmitt's attitude about that, right?
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.240]   Could Schmitt be the person?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   Schmitt for president, Schmitt for president.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   Will you know?
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.520]   That's a dumb quotes all the time.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.360]   It'll be so much fun to cover.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   It would be fun.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   I have to say.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   It would be so much fun.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   Oh, got to be so much fun.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   How tall is he?
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   Is he talks?
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   He got to be tall.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.360]   Yeah, he's tall.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   He's tall.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   Okay.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.960]   I can't believe that we've gotten a Schmitt the president.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   Schmitt for president.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   I want to write that down.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.880]   I think we need to sell bumper stickers.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   Schmitt for president.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.160]   But here's the question.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:53.400]   Is it really a public sphere when all of the conversation occurs within these private
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.440]   platforms like Facebook or Twitter or Google?
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.920]   Does that mean that it's no longer quite as free or public?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   I guess not.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.720]   I mean, it has to be federated in the way that the web is.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   That's what we want.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   That's what we want.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.600]   And that's what APIs are kind of the beginning of providing.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.800]   And the kind of data sharing, the partnerships that we see, that's a good thing.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.440]   But yeah, we definitely, this is why I've been kind of obsessed with federated platforms
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.040]   and systems for so long.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.000]   I was like, if we create platforms where people can set up a node and connect with the others,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.600]   and the data ownership is distributed, those are the kind of platforms that I want to see.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   100% agree.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.960]   I mean, that's why I was always uncomfortable with Twitter and preferred status net.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.600]   I was always uncomfortable with Facebook, maybe Tiasper as a solution there.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.920]   Ethical treatment or having the solution is competition purely, I think.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.000]   The problem we have in access, the problem we have with net neutrality is that we are
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.360]   imprisoned to duoplies at best in our country, right?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   And that allows them to do this to us.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.880]   At some point, the fact that Google has 60 some percent market share in the US being
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   as a healthy thing.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.880]   But there are a lot of stakeholders.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.320]   So now you have the stakeholder, which is the carrier, the internet service provider.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.520]   You have the platform, which is Facebook or Google.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.240]   These all have commercial interests.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.720]   But so does an economy.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.880]   So does a society.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   That's not necessarily.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:32.160]   Yes, but does our society, Trump, I mean, do we, I mean, this is what Tim Wu's talking
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:38.640]   about is that ultimately these commercial interests win and they Trump our interest
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.680]   are as a society.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.360]   You see it, you know, I mean, that's where we're sitting right now with the whole intellectual
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   property debate, you know, the whole debate over music and movies is, you know, the societal,
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:58.960]   the needs of a society versus the interests of content creators.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.200]   That's what I think that's what Larry Lessig would say.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   This is a great conversation.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.720]   I'm going to interrupt it briefly.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.200]   And then I'm going to commercial purposes for capital.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Make it somebody.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   And it's okay.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.000]   Yeah, you know, because we have had a good conversation here.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.040]   And I did not in any way let the fact that carbonite.com is a sponsor impact this conversation.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.240]   I am going to show the best damn ad.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.280]   We're going to, we're going to, that's where we're going to, our memories of it will be
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   secure, right?
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   Leo?
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   Yes.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   Yes.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   Precisely.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.120]   I am going to show you the best damn ad I've ever seen in just a bit from Intel.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   Yes.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   Yes.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.280]   And I think it's fascinating.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.480]   And I think it reflects kind of a new way of advertising because it's an ad instead of
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.200]   an ad that's targeted at me, which is the newest thing that Google did.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.440]   This is an ad that features me.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.320]   It's the museum of me.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.520]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.960]   We still haven't got through all 10 points.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.480]   We got to talk about facial recognition.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.080]   Then we got to get to Twitter and its platform speaking of which.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.000]   Speaking of Twitter, I get a lot to do.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.320]   So let me quickly talk a little bit about carbonite.com.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.760]   This is your right.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.800]   This is where you save all your stuff.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.200]   And very important that you do so.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.440]   If you go to carbonite.com right now and use the offer code twig, you could try it right
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   now for two weeks free.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.600]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.360]   Here's the carbonite's backup, right?
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.640]   So it's cloud, but it's cloud based.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   It's internet backup.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.400]   And that's really the strength of carbonite is that even if the worst happens, your data
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   is safe.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.080]   Hard drives die, laptops get stolen, backups disappear.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.240]   But when you have been backing up to carbonite, you always have access to your data.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.680]   Even before a disaster happens, you log into your carbonite account on a Mac or a PC or
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   on an Android phone, an iPhone, on a BlackBerry, and there's your stuff.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.360]   So it's cloud storage.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.800]   Restoring is as easy as clicking a button.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.040]   I'm just a huge fan and I encourage you to give it a try free for two weeks.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.360]   Carbonite.com offer code TWIG.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.240]   If you decide to buy, now, by the way, this is very affordable.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.040]   It's $59 a year and that isn't for like a gig or two gigs or a hundred gigs or that.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.160]   Whatever is for whatever amount of data you have on your internal drive.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.040]   You can't just start plugging in a bunch of drives, but whatever's on your internal
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:20.800]   drive, the contents of your laptop, for instance, that's less than $5 a month.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.640]   That's a good deal.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.400]   Carbonite.com, 16 cents a day.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.480]   Try it free right now.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.240]   Carbonite.com, if you use the offer code TWIG when you buy, you'll get two free months.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.120]   So it's 14 months for the price of 12.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.320]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   So do it right with Carbonite.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.480]   So real quickly, Eric Schmidt said, we knew this, we knew this that things like Google
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.320]   Goggles had face recognition.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.880]   Capabilities.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:55.320]   He said, face recognition is the only product Google has withheld.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.760]   And I think they probably did the right thing.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.720]   But can you hold the genie in the bottle?
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.560]   I wish they'd, I want it.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.800]   Because I have a terrible memory.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.320]   I mean, the larger comment that he said is that he realized that the, like the, the
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.920]   same platform for doing good is the one that you'd use to do evil, right?
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.560]   So the terrorists use the same tools that the people do.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.680]   And, and, and the facial recognition thing was one of the, was, was one of the only things
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.960]   that they held back because they felt like people could use this to create a biometric
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.200]   database and, and, and watch people.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.840]   I mean, I know I don't think you can keep that genie in the bottle.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.920]   Someone else is going to do it then.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.720]   I mean, this is right.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.000]   Um, interesting that Google decided to hold that one back.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.560]   But I think that that was really good insight and, and something that made me feel good about
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:43.960]   Schmidt really, I agree, but I'll do the devil's advocate here, which is that it's a cynical
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.320]   PR move that they'll let somebody else do it first because they don't want to be the
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   ones who always kill privacy.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.000]   They'll let, you know, Microsoft do it or they'll let a government do it and then I'll
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.920]   what the heck is already out will come along.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.360]   I mean, this very much, this very well may be Google trying to say, Hey, look, we're
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.160]   really not as creepy as you thought.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.960]   We could do this thing, but we don't because we're taking care of you.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.680]   You know, maybe this is a PR move.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   Right.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.160]   And letting someone else to take it off.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Sure.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   Sure.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.160]   That's, I'll accept that.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   Okay.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   It's all.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   Well, I don't, I mean, ultimately.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.320]   I don't mean it, but I, but I think, you know, the question is, as I read that, I was thinking
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.840]   about how could you at least start using it for good?
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   Right.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.400]   Every day on our local news, I suspect you have the same thing.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.480]   We have the missing child, by the way, I've never fully understood because if we really,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.400]   truly had kidnapped children, it's obviously domestic disputes that accounts for most or
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.080]   all of this, but fine.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.320]   So we have that.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:50.680]   So when I interviewed Schmidt, as long as they're blonde and white and cute, then it's
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   a nightly news.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.480]   Then we care, bring out the book gardens.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   Right.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:01.520]   Well, I interviewed Schmidt about the German official who said that use official recognition
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.200]   and geo together were taboo forever now.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.520]   And I said, that's kind of ludicrous to, to eliminate the use of the technology before
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   it's used.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.600]   And you could use it to find missing children or to find people after Katrina.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.200]   And it can be useful.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.720]   And Schmidt said that it would be laughable for that to be passed in, for example, the
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.280]   UK, where they do use it, he says, to find terrorists and airports.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.440]   And then he said, you know, you kind of have a choice.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.400]   Would you rather have more invasive, yet more and more and more invasive searches of
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.760]   your body and information at the airport?
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.280]   Or would you rather have the cameras looking out for known terrorists?
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   Hmm.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   Hmm.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   Hmm.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   Good point.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:54.160]   I guess that's a good point.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.760]   Technology can be used to invade your privacy, but it also can be used to protect you, I guess.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.280]   Yeah, I guess that's a good point.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.600]   Someone said security theater versus privacy theater.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   Right.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.080]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   Good answer.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.600]   That's what we were trying to think of.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   That's what the delay was.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   We were trying to think of that.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.480]   He did respond to the filter bubble Eli Parris' book.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.560]   He says, the differences are pretty small and I'd have to agree in every test we've
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   done.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.880]   You can hardly tell a difference in the personalization of your search.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.600]   I think it's a little bit of an overstatement to make a point.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.240]   He says this was kind of a surprise.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.720]   Walt Mossberg kind of beat up on him and said that his Google results are more and more
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.160]   polluted.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.760]   Schmidt said, and this is because this is in regard to that update where they kind of
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   blocked demand media and other kind of similar garbage info sites.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.080]   He said that the update impacted only, this is the Panda update, 12% of search results.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.760]   He says, Google makes hundreds of improvements every quarter that aren't seen and it's working
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.840]   more to come up with direct answers rather than links to information.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.360]   If we can come up with the right answer, we'll give it to you.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.320]   Answers instead of search results.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.920]   But that's to me a big issue for them going forward.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.440]   If you want to get media companies and destination sites and information sites to hate Google,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.240]   then bypassing them entirely and just handing the answer over, we'll do that.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.520]   Google's response I think would be, well, people don't want to link.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.000]   They want the answer.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.600]   So then the question becomes, well, where does Google get the answer from all these sites?
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.000]   We'll go around and around and around there as to are they at that point if they don't
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.160]   link and they only answer, are they then acquiring the value of those other sites with no return?
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.240]   Well, there might be opportunities for return though.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   What have Google said to a site?
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.600]   If you provide answers to certain questions in a certain semantic format, we'll pay you
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.760]   the ad money.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.560]   You get some sort of ad sends deal for the searches that return those answers.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.120]   I'm just totally just speculating that this could be.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:24.200]   What's to motivate sites that have these answers to provide that data in an easier way or an
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.640]   easily crawled way?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.840]   I don't know.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   I thought it was interesting that this coming up with answers is very much what Bing, right?
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.000]   Bing markets itself as a decision engine.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.320]   And Schmidt basically said that Bing is better at some of this than Google is, which surprised
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:46.280]   me because I just have yet to see Bing really beat out Google myself.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.200]   It is interesting.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.880]   I mean, sites really are going to hate Google if it provides their content without the
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:00.040]   the first test of this is the airline schedules, which is another story up on the list today.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   It is really cool right today.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.720]   If you go to Google, is this nobody's tip?
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.520]   Is it right?
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.160]   Nope.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:05.640]   Nope.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.320]   Go ahead and put in flight.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.160]   EWR LAX, you get the schedule.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.520]   Huh.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.880]   And that's because they bought it by T.A. rather.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.760]   EWR to LAX.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.720]   Well, flight.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.320]   You have to say flight.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.000]   Yeah, like flights to LA or.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.840]   I don't have to say colon, just flight.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.800]   I'll just flight.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.480]   It's just for giving.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.040]   LAX.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.640]   Give us your sins like that.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.120]   There you go.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.600]   Look at that.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.040]   And then, uh, and then click on the plus.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.280]   Now click on the link where it says, yeah, there it is Bingo.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.680]   Wow.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.080]   Now I can't buy it.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.520]   All right.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.240]   They should.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.280]   I mean, if they want to make money,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.320]   they should have a link right to.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.920]   Uh, that's next.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.760]   That's really cool.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.040]   Isn't it?
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   Say it same as if you want flight status.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.360]   If you just put in, you know, CO123 for continental,
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.560]   it'll tell you the flight status.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.440]   I'll just say flight.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.960]   No, just CO.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.840]   But they've done that for a while, right?
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.120]   That's wild, right?
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.680]   So now you have the, there's the status from Copenhagen.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.400]   I didn't even know what it was.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.760]   Good, good guess.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.440]   That's from a website though, flightstats.com.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.080]   But the information I need is right there.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:11.640]   Is right there.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.000]   All right.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.200]   And you do want that, right?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.040]   I mean, I always, whenever that happens,
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.680]   like, uh, if I do a currency, uh, or a,
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.440]   use Google calculator, I like that,
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.240]   that the answer is there.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.200]   I don't have to click a link.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.640]   Uh, I don't know how, I don't know if they've made a deal with
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.240]   flightstats.com to do that.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.480]   But I mean, that that is a link at the top.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.560]   If you want to see a map or if you want to dive deeper,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.320]   right, you would, you would click on the link.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.360]   Uh, so I think he's right.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   That is something we want our search engines to do.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.240]   And, uh, I think Google's doing a better job.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.280]   That's good.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.720]   And if Bing's doing a better job,
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   then people will start using Bing.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.760]   I think though, ultimately, you don't,
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.720]   you don't steal, uh, from Google unless you give better search results.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.600]   Not better answers.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   Right?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.840]   Don't we still use the search engines for search?
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   Mostly.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.720]   Yes, mostly.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.560]   So it's not enough.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.160]   You know, I guess if you knew, oh, uh, if I search for flight on Bing,
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.200]   I'm going to get better results.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   You might, I don't think people,
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.760]   I don't think people, uh, choose their search engine bay
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.840]   based on, uh, what they're looking for.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.080]   Right.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.680]   But let's skip forward to, to mobile and voice.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.160]   And, you know, I have a question.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.000]   I'm driving from Boston to New York.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.800]   Here's where I am.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.320]   My phone knows where I am.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.200]   Where is the next?
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.160]   Chipotle.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.560]   Right.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.040]   I want, not, not the nearest because it may be,
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.040]   you know, back, right?
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.320]   It knows which way I'm going.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.960]   Where is the next?
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.360]   Chipotle.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.960]   I don't care for a search at that point.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.600]   I don't want the answer.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.160]   And maps kind of does that for me.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.880]   Right.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.160]   Not in that route way, which I want.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.440]   That's the next thing I want to Google.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.640]   So you might do it if it's different apps and it's a more,
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.080]   uh, protracted search.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.360]   I mean, you know, uh, well, currency is a good example.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.840]   I have a currency app on my phone, or I know I could do a Google search on a phone.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.160]   You probably, you launch an app on my desktop.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.080]   Uh, if I had a currency app versus a Google search,
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.280]   I always have the browser open.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.000]   I probably just enter the currency into Google.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.160]   Right.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.280]   So how does Google power that?
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.320]   And the irony is that I think Google would power that through APIs.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.560]   Right.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.280]   Um, but they, they killed by the way,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.000]   their translation API this week, which I, I'm, I'm upset about.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.600]   Um, because you want others to use this stuff to make apps.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.360]   Which API did they kill?
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.880]   The translation one.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.200]   What?
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.000]   Really?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.960]   Yeah, you can, you can store your translation, but you can't use the API.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.360]   They're killing.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.800]   They kill it about six or seven APIs.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.320]   Huh.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.040]   I'm not waiting for the last, uh, actually, but the bad people.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.480]   They're bad.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.360]   They're bad and wrong.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.240]   APIs are good.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.200]   Killing them is bad.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.320]   Yes.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.480]   Well, speaking of APIs, this Intel museum of me is an example of,
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.040]   because I don't, I don't maybe Intel made a deal with Facebook.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.120]   I don't know, but they, it's very cool.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.040]   They, you have to give it permission and access to your Facebook, uh, account.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   And pretty extensive permissions.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.280]   Yeah, it's a long list, isn't it?
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.480]   Of all the stuff you're giving them.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   Yeah, it is.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   And it is just an ad for Intel, but I think it's kind of a neat demonstration of,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.240]   um, what an API can do.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.440]   So I, I just gave him permission by clicking, you know, get it.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.800]   Now it's gathering all the data from my Facebook account.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.280]   Let me go full screen on this so you can see it.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   And you could see quite a bit of stuff going in there, mostly JPEGs.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.520]   Is there a special room just for your insurance layout?
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   There should be.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.600]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, the museum of Leo.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.600]   [Laughs]
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.640]   Now it did that pretty quick.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.480]   It says Leo LePorte exhibition, 2 p.m. on Wednesday.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.000]   Already I'm getting chills.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.800]   I love this.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:48.200]   That's a, that's my Facebook picture, which is a picture me in college, old picture.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.120]   But I mentioned that because you'll see, I had bad hair then.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.040]   So these are, these are the people I interact with the most,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.760]   all of them are people I work with.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.120]   On, and I'm sorry, Gina and Jeffy weren't on there, but.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.480]   And look, there's people looking at my exhibition.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.680]   I'm so happy.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.480]   And being a California, the first time, which is a retail.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.840]   Yeah, and there's, and then this is a kind of a montage of other pictures.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.080]   I think profile pictures I've used.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.760]   And now we go into the next room where you can see all the places I've been Google maps on that, by the way.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.200]   And that's, that was kind of a boring exhibit.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.880]   These are the words I use the most on my Facebook page and analyze that.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:37.800]   International like dry martini house time.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.920]   Sail week, twit number one.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.400]   What?
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.280]   Look at that.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:51.320]   Now, I know that this was done algorithmically by sucking data off my Facebook page, but I'm still feeling pretty warm about Intel right about now.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.200]   A big thumbs up because Intel made a museum of me.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.920]   Just for me.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.840]   These are videos I've liked.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.760]   San Francisco Giants picture.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.960]   I'm, I think I got short shrift on that one.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.320]   That was a very short video wall.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.880]   And then this is, this is fun.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.200]   These are.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.080]   Yeah, this is really cool.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.120]   Until robots taking all the pictures from all the people I know.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.160]   These are all my friends.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.720]   I don't know that guy.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.880]   And they're going to take those.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.080]   Yeah, he knows me.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.280]   They're going to take all the pictures.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.080]   These are personal.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.520]   This is highly personalized of people I know and they're going to assemble it.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.040]   What are they assembling into?
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.600]   I don't know.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:43.720]   Let's zoom out and see why look they've assembled it into a giant picture of you.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.680]   Me.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.440]   Golly, I like you Intel.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.960]   The chat room is just there appalled.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.760]   Are they throwing up?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.160]   They are appalled.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.480]   There's all the people I know in my universe.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.680]   Look, that's you.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.400]   This is the most.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:42:59.800]   This is the most.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.120]   What node on the network that is our universe.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.440]   It is all of us together in the.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.240]   Connected.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.040]   Connected.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.960]   I love you.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.840]   What is that cell of Intel's?
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.560]   Huh?
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.920]   What is that cell of Intel?
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.240]   I don't know, but I watched it about 80 times.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.840]   Everyone in the chat room is like, Leo, it's cheesy.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.680]   I think that's cheesy.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.160]   I think now already it's cheesy, but it works.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.840]   So I was fascinated by this because I think I've gathered social media data.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.160]   I've been thinking about visualizations of that data.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.480]   I tend to come at it from the more useful visualizations.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.760]   What insights can this give me?
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   This was, let's face it, this was eye candy.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.320]   Right?
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.040]   We all want to look at pictures of our friends and things that have happened to us.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.800]   Just another mirror to look at ourselves.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.000]   Right? I mean, we're humans.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.920]   That's where the stars of our own mind.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.560]   That's what we.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.040]   That's what we.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.080]   And then the museum really kind of creates that idea.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.160]   You feel important and you remember things.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.800]   I saw a video of Mike the little cousin and I was like,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.680]   Oh, I got the woman Fuzzy's because these are people that I care about.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.720]   But really, this is just, you know, this giant flash movie
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.080]   that sucked in a bunch of Jason.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.360]   And then showed it.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.240]   It's a euciques.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.280]   So unromained.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.520]   It's an O to the API.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.720]   It's an O to the API.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.800]   I mean, I have to tell you, I was totally impressed with it.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.200]   I thought as far as social media visualizations go,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.320]   we very, very well done.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.880]   People in the chat room are asking, you know, what did you,
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.280]   what other permissions, you know, what is Intel going to do with all that data,
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.640]   you know, besides show you this thing?
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.680]   I, you know, I don't know.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.080]   It was.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.040]   Come on.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.840]   I mean, what would they do?
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.440]   I mean, what are they going to write?
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   Right.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:34.600]   Right.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.680]   And by the way, all this stuff is public.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.120]   It's all public on my page.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:38.760]   So I don't mind.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.440]   I mean, if you had a private Facebook page,
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.040]   you might want to not want to do it.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:42.440]   Right.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:42.840]   Right.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.360]   But I mean, it was a great ad.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.320]   It was a really nice ad.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.720]   And I do.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.480]   I agree that I think it's the future of advertising.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.920]   So it's interesting how you take, how you take away what you're interested in.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.440]   So your interest is as a developer,
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.080]   from the API use, but visualization is of data.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.360]   And me, I was thinking, wow, ads.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.160]   Now I think going forward, I expect to see more ads that I'm a star of.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.600]   Right.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:04.840]   Right.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.800]   Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.360]   Absolutely.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   I mean, you know, we think we've been trying to figure out like,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.960]   how can you, we want to reveal something to you about yourself,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.200]   given, you know, that your data and aggregate that you shared across these different networks.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   You know, this is one of my personal kind of, kind of interest.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.240]   So like, like the, the words that you use are the things that are most important.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.000]   I think sentiment analysis is really interesting.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.200]   And tag clouds and all sorts of ways to show that.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.760]   I think there's, there's even more we can go even further.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.960]   That's why I love things like the Fitbit and, you know, things that sort of gather little bits of data over time
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.120]   and then can, can make sort of general observations about that you can use to,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.160]   you know, exercise more better health or, or, you know, I don't know, think more positive.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.560]   I don't know.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.800]   So, so yeah, it's my fun.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.480]   It's what?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.720]   Have you ever seen We Feel Fine dot org?
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.200]   No.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.120]   Oh, oh, we love this.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.200]   I'm going to make sure it's real fun.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.560]   It's, Jonathan Harris is a brilliant
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.520]   programmer, designer, thinker.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.560]   And so go to open We Feel Fine there, Leo.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.520]   Please wait patiently.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.880]   Oh, now always run.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.400]   This is some Java is now, I guess this is a Chrome thing.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:18.200]   Now Chrome asked me if before Java or QuickTime will run, which I think is kind of interesting.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.960]   What he did was he was, he was, he was in a long time before, before Twitter,
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:27.160]   but has collected millions and millions and millions of things following I feel or feelings.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.120]   Ah.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.400]   So they did a book of it.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   It's just brilliant.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.640]   And they got all kinds of data about this that, that talks about the total of the people there.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:42.040]   Um, of how do we feel, um, uh, happy or sad or whatever?
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.760]   And then you see what's tied to that and you see specific posts.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:50.920]   So Gina, what I, what I think you can tell is, is that it can start to, um, check your mood, right?
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.760]   And Jean, Jean, you know, could do that.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.640]   I could check how many angry emails I've sent, how many angry tweets I've done.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.600]   Okay.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.400]   Really it could.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.360]   And pretty soon it could.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.480]   It could be checked narcotics into my bloodstream.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.160]   According to that.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.320]   My, my anger is closely correlated to my cabernet.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.120]   Uh, yeah.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   And I could just pump a little cabernet in there.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.320]   Oh, right.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.680]   No, but I kind of, okay.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:17.640]   So now get ready because you know that Mark Zuckerberg's whole life is all around.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   How can I, what, what pay off can I give people to incite,
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   incent them to give me more information?
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.080]   So here is a wonderful thing.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.680]   Now if you give me more and forget the movie, I'll pump cabernet into your veins.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.280]   I'll give you a phone that sh ritz's prozac into your face.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:42.040]   So, so, so, so, uh, all you have to do is just let me see your life.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.280]   Just press that allow button.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.400]   And I will make sure that you're happy forever.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:53.800]   This is why you want apps that gather your data that you own versus giving other people
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.920]   access to your data.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.200]   Federation.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.160]   I'm giving it to Zuck because he's going to do the right thing with it.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.600]   Any man who kills his own meat.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.320]   He's, he's turning into Ted Nugent.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.200]   I just want to warn you.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.800]   Just get ready.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.360]   He's going to be.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.240]   Don't be like this.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.960]   That is the danger of the rich and famous person.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.200]   Yes.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   We can't be covered by Trisam.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.720]   How are you?
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.960]   He's going to be collecting his pee in a jar.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.520]   I don't know.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.240]   I'm sorry, Mark.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.360]   I'm sure you won't be doing that, but it's a little weird to only eat meat that you kill
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   personally.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.440]   I did not.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.240]   I missed the story.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:33.960]   Was this a new story?
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.920]   Did Zuck say he only?
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.600]   Is it only?
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.840]   I think it's true.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.720]   He seems to be, it's on his Facebook page.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.560]   He seems to be pretty out about it.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.920]   He started with lobster.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.520]   He said the first thing I killed was a lobster.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.120]   He said actually that was the hardest because it was live and I boiled it,
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.720]   but it sure felt good eating it.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.880]   And then now I think he stepped up to, I think he just killed a pig and.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.000]   Like that's it.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.800]   I'm a vegetarian.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.600]   Well, you know what though?
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   There is a certain purity, a normal purity that I respect there because you're exactly right.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.320]   If you had to kill your own meat instead of buying it,
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.600]   aniseptically packaged it's safe way, maybe you would be a vegetarian.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.080]   I would.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.160]   I don't want to see the fit.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.880]   Look into the eyes of the animal I'm about to eat.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.440]   Seriously.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.280]   Oh.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.400]   Let's not think about that.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.440]   I'm just, I'm deeply disturbed.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.600]   Because I'm not ready to give up bacon.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.800]   I don't care if that pig has a sad expression.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.040]   Did we speaking of which?
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.440]   Did you see Rovio is going to put angry birds on.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.840]   What a transition.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.640]   You are the master.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.960]   I found you.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.840]   The roke of bacon.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.760]   Speaking of bacon.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.280]   And eggs.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.360]   Perfect.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.800]   That's how Leo's brain works.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.320]   It is how my brain works.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:53.880]   Alas.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.040]   Looking for feelings.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.560]   So this is finally loaded.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   This is we feel fine looking for feelings of people in the last few minutes.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.360]   So each one of those is the worst.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.760]   So if you click on any one of those feelings, you'll see,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.320]   you'll start to see those are feelings going around the web.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.560]   I feel like Bartle be this crivener that is the character.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.320]   Bartle be on a regular basis increasing.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.040]   And that's due to the fact that I perceive society to be further and further
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.880]   skew from what I personally accept or agree with.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.320]   I think this person's having a simple.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.520]   In fact, personal and soba.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.760]   I've been focusing on four areas that need addressing
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.120]   and have been feeling encouraged over.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.160]   Where is this coming from?
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.680]   This is from blogs.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.800]   Oh, I see.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   So he's just he scrapes millions of wall.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.840]   He's skimming the internet.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   I got them about two months ago because sometimes I feel uncomfortable riding along
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.880]   the river road.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.640]   Even in the early morning, there are a lot of cars going really fast.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.720]   Well, he does all kinds of visualizations of the data over time where you can see ages
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.440]   versus feelings, times of year versus feelings.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.120]   So you can pick a word.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.480]   You can pick the word.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   Yes.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.360]   This is a certificate.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.400]   Wow.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.320]   See, I want this for just my friends.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.760]   What's that's what that's what I'm.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.800]   Yeah, that's what man's part of.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.440]   Or just you.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.720]   Or just me.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.400]   Or just me and then just my friends.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.280]   I don't have any friends.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.000]   So it's a computer.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.960]   How do I feel today?
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.080]   I want it to be like, it's like, show me all the negative nancies in my Twitter stream
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.120]   because I want to unfollow them.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.760]   That kind of thing.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.120]   Well, that's what you're doing.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.160]   You're a treato.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:13.560]   Isn't it?
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.720]   Isn't this what you're doing?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.840]   That's this is part of.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.080]   Yes.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.680]   This is part of what we're trying.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.320]   We're trying to do with think up is to be able to slice and dice things in that way.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.920]   We haven't built in sentiment analysis yet.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.440]   We're doing word clouds.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.640]   But yes, this is the happening.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.560]   You can really play with this because he does some brilliant visualizations.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.200]   He's Jonathan's a Harris is brilliant guy.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.640]   He also did something called the whale hunt,
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.080]   speaking of killing what you eat.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   Where he went on a whale hunt and it took a picture at least once every five minutes
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:41.960]   the whole time.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.720]   But more often when things were happening.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.160]   So he visualized all the photos are clumped together when they killed the whale
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.800]   and what kinds of stuff.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.080]   So he's really a good visualizer.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:56.120]   And he's kind of the data to say, do we feel more good than bad at what age?
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:03.320]   You know, this all of this leads me to want to go to the big data conference.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.560]   Because it's all about data, isn't it?
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.400]   And it's all about getting more data and then smart things to do with that data.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.320]   I love it that that's what you're interested in, Gina.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.360]   I think that's fascinating.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:15.880]   Absolutely.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.960]   It's not easy, but it's fun.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.920]   That's for sure.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   Gina, there's a conference at Berkman and I think a week or two, I'm going on living the
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.960]   hyper public life.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.280]   Are you the only guy there?
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.240]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.960]   Just get the foster boy.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:36.360]   No, I'll come.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.880]   That's interesting.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.080]   So, but I mean, are you, are you going to speak at this or are you just
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:43.960]   going to moderate a panel?
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.080]   I think it's just interesting.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.480]   But Dana Boyd's there and folks like that and it's Berkman.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.200]   So it'll be smart.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.160]   They let me in anyway.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.200]   Sounds fascinating.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.240]   Yeah, it sounds good.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:51.880]   It sounds really good.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.840]   It might, well, yeah.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.600]   Living the hyper public.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.880]   Will any of it be streamed or?
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.400]   I don't know.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.080]   I imagine something that'll be live logged.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.640]   Center, I'll bet.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.440]   Wouldn't it be funny if we're a private conference?
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:02.840]   I know.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.040]   Well, I went berserk on the BBC two weeks ago.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.360]   They held a conference, a social media conference,
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.520]   and they did it on their Chatham House rule,
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.560]   which means that you can't quote anyone by name or say who's there.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.080]   I said, are you berserk?
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.400]   I went completely ballistic on them.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.920]   I'm making fun of them for this.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.960]   And don't you get the total deafness of that?
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.160]   Hey, is your number 54%?
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.680]   No.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.000]   Okay.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.960]   Total US ad revenues.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   Oh, it's a good number.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.200]   But this isn't your number.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   No, no, I loved it for the general discussion.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:44.120]   Total US internet ad revenues, $7.3 billion in the first quarter.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.880]   That's a 23% increase from last year.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.000]   You know I'm liking that.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.240]   Seemingly providing more evidence that tech sector is in a bubble.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.400]   After all, what kind of industry could possibly sustain 23% growth over the long run?
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:05.240]   But watch the graph because it turns out Google gets 54 cents of every dollar.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.560]   More than half of all that money goes to the goog.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.760]   Wow.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   They know how to make money.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.600]   They know how to make money.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.400]   That's for sure.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.720]   And full disclosure, I'm a stockholder and I'm proud of them.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.640]   My little, my glaring moment there.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.600]   There's yourington moment.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.160]   There's the graph of quarterly revenue growth.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.520]   This isn't, this is the growth in billions from 1999 to 2010.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   We had a little drop off there.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   I don't know what happened to 2009, but.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.120]   That was the crash.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.840]   That was the second crash.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.160]   Right.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:41.960]   Right.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.760]   The little bitty.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.280]   Boy, that tells you something.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.440]   That was the, that was where the recession happened.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.640]   It affects even them.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.280]   But not much.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.160]   No.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.320]   Even 2009 was better than 2007.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:59.720]   54% of all US internet advertising spend is collected by Google.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:06.200]   Google revenue by quarter and millions of dollars.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.080]   Now almost nine.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.280]   No, no, no, maybe extra I get that straight.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.040]   So, so 54% of all spent gets, so Google then gets half of that.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:12.600]   No.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:13.720]   For.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.520]   Oh, because they keep half.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.160]   I guess you're right.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.040]   I guess that's revenue.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:18.600]   That's revenue.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.640]   I guess that's revenue.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.640]   Profit is one half, roughly a half of that.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.840]   They keep 50.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.280]   Is that what they said that they keep 50?
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.120]   It's, it's, those aren't the exact numbers, but it's roughly that.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.240]   But if that's only for ads that appear off Google, on Google,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.520]   it obviously goes 100% to Google.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:37.080]   So Facebook had 8.8% of, then this, we're going to talk about the display ad market.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.960]   8.8% of the display ad market in Q4.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.320]   Google had 14.4% for almost 400 million dollars.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.200]   In display ads, that's banners, columns.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:51.800]   So Google whooped Facebook in that particular category.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.680]   Interesting.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.280]   That Facebook hasn't really started yet though.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.040]   And they, and they're, they have to be a little, they're being a little judicious
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.000]   in how they use that stuff.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.080]   I don't, I, I think there's no hurry for Facebook at all.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.120]   Google has added plus one now to websites.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.160]   So I have a, you know, Twitter yesterday added to follow me button.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.520]   And now.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.320]   That's a mark.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.440]   I put it on, I put it on my website right away to join the.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.320]   Earnings, journalists will use it.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.560]   Did you, I want to be liked.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:20.840]   I want to be followed.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.040]   And I want to be plus one.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.640]   I haven't got the plus one button yet, but.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.440]   Plus one I'm still not enthusiastic about.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.720]   It's, well, this is the other shoe to drop because right, you know,
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.200]   when we first saw plus one, it was a Google labs thing that you would do
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.400]   within the search results.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.560]   But now you could put it on a website, right?
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:37.720]   Right.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.840]   This makes a lot more sense, right?
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.800]   Because you're already at the site.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.600]   It's much more sense.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.320]   I get it.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.120]   Very powerful.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.160]   Okay.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.440]   So if I, you know, if I look at my website, you'll see I have,
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.280]   I've implemented all the buttons, the like button, the send button,
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.600]   the follow button, I got to have a plus one button now.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.200]   But hold on there for a second.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.600]   So you hit the plus one button, you hit the like button,
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.320]   you know what happens.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.680]   Your friends can see what you like.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.000]   Right.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.920]   You can come to the side of my face like, yeah.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.960]   You hit the plus one.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.840]   What's the payoff for you?
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.000]   When I search for the thing that you plus one,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.400]   I will see that you plus one that in my results.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.560]   Same thing. You just, you let your friends know.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.840]   But it doesn't show up in Facebook.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:13.880]   It shows up in search.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.120]   Right.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.640]   Just shows up in Google search, right?
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.080]   So like is more benefit for, for Google than there is for me.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:19.800]   Yes.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.680]   That's still the case.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.640]   I'm helping the goog.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.680]   Now, if what I would want to do Leo power you is I would want to run a little app that would
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.280]   combine the two.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.440]   Well, there are plugins like the there's share.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.200]   Yeah, there's sharing plugins.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.080]   If I use that on my, uh, don't know what I'm saying that with one click.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.440]   It goes to both points.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.560]   Oh, like, oh, you should say it's like, plus one follow.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.040]   Plus one follow.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:44.520]   Do it all.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.040]   Plus like, yeah.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.120]   Plus like go just like me, man.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.400]   Love plus like me.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.240]   What a love me, Bob.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:51.560]   Love.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.240]   That's better than like.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:56.360]   This is like one of those apps that check, check you in all the different geolocation
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.840]   services that aggregated aggregation apps.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.640]   So I can create a so this is what the book looks like.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.520]   I, I, I, it's singing to me, man.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.280]   Oh, and here's why, here's why a website would want to do it because it shows all the plus ones.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:09.880]   So that's nice.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.400]   So yeah, that's good for them.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.640]   And then I can, uh,
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.640]   get include count.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.600]   I could take that out.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.200]   I could parse on load JS callbacks.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.160]   I can add my own callback function, which could be the love button.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.480]   The button and then you just put a little JavaScript right there.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.560]   Right there in the code.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.960]   Easy peasy.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.040]   So I'm going to be, I'm going to be capital is Jeff and ask when are there going to be
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.080]   sponsored plus one.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   So like when is Google going to pay Leo or when our tech company is going to pay Leo
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.640]   to like their stuff?
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.200]   Right.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:51.320]   Because a lot of people follow you and your recommendation, especially for tech items is,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.200]   is it a gold?
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.840]   Oh, well, well, okay.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.200]   There's two layers of that, right?
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.240]   There's this spam layer.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.480]   There's the mechanical Turk poor person in poor country who's paid to click a hundred
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.120]   times a day.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:02.520]   Right.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.480]   Right.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.000]   So how does Google, we need, we have had that cuts on a long time.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.360]   By the way, the previous discussion, Kevin Marks was jumping up a down to give on.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.840]   I know.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.680]   It was just his kind of discussion.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.520]   This is not an on demand podcast.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.560]   No, I'm sorry, Kevin.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.920]   I'm so eager.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.760]   Next time we were going to the next discussion.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:31.160]   But, but with Matt, how do they prevent spam level of plus one?
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.840]   That's one layer of this, right?
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.720]   And then the other layer is one, you just mentioned, which is, which is fascinating,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.920]   is does Ashton Kutcher make a million dollars for a plus one?
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.040]   Right.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:40.520]   He should, right?
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.200]   And Leo, a hundred thousand.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.480]   But I'm confused.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:49.640]   So if I plus would something and it would, how would people, how would Google know if you're my
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.360]   friend?
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.440]   So Google knows you're my friend.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:56.520]   If we're connected on Twitter, if you're in my, my Gmail's contacts list, I mean,
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.800]   right.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.520]   This is not supposed to work.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.000]   I see Leo Leport shared this on Twitter.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.880]   If I see, you know, if I search something and get a link in my results.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.400]   But we're both on Twitter or we're both.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.280]   Facebook.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.560]   But what does the Google do?
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:13.240]   Google knows that we're friends on Twitter and they know if you're in my contacts in Gmail.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.840]   Right.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.520]   See, this is, this is the problem we were talking about earlier that Google may know it, but can
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.200]   they surface it without?
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.520]   So, so let's go, let's go farther.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:29.560]   So the problem there is that someone sees that you like the site, but you quite explicitly said
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.120]   plus one.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.240]   So what's the problem of people saying that Leo likes this?
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.200]   You're telling the world.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.960]   But see, when I look at, when I look at say here where it says 156 people like this,
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.800]   and if I like it, then it will say Leo and 156, well, I'll do it right now.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.880]   So we'll see it's now, it says my name.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.840]   Right.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.720]   And I see your name.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.680]   If I see things.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.600]   If you're if you're my Facebook buddy.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.400]   Right.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.200]   If we're friends, left, right, which we are, and that's kind of a big deal.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.440]   If I see that you're like something, that's how you, yeah, it is.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.000]   That's valuable.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:00:59.800]   But how is Google?
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.000]   What is Google going to say?
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.680]   Where do they get that information?
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.960]   How do they know you're my friend?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.000]   Well, I see in search, you know, you're right.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.080]   I see people when I do searches, I see the gene.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.280]   It's like, really?
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.560]   Oh, so they're like, that's because we're, that's because we're friends on Twitter.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.280]   And that's public.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.400]   That relationship is public.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.720]   And so, and Google knows that relationship.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.880]   So, and, and, and I also get so and so shared this in Google Reader,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.320]   which by the way, I can't wait for Google Reader to just move over to plus one.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:25.960]   And get rid of it.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.760]   I mean, there's so many different ways right now to do things in Google Reader,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.920]   like comment, star, that's true.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.600]   There is following a Google Reader.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.840]   And they're following, they're, they're right.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.720]   And those are public.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.520]   Uh, actually, I'm not sure if that, if following a Google Reader is public.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.080]   But they've got a few different social graphs.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.640]   I definitely see my friends in Google search results.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.720]   So, what I'm saying is like, so everyone's going to go around and plus one everything,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:47.960]   right?
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.280]   But not everyone, not everyone is Leo.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.600]   Like if Leo likes it, then that's a big deal to me.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.920]   Not only because we're friends, but also because you are trusted personality and brand
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.240]   and tech recommendations, which is why I got to the part where I was like,
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.040]   when do you get paid?
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.400]   Kevin, Kevin Marks, who knows this says, following his public on blogger and reader,
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.080]   they certainly could use those two as.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.160]   Information.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:09.400]   Yep.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.680]   And I guess Twitter is public.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.000]   So.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.960]   And Twitter is public, right?
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.080]   And then following people on reader or blogger, of course, they're going to suggest
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.040]   people in your contacts.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.200]   I'm adding the plus one button right now to my website.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.480]   Nice.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.120]   I mean, it feels, I'm a little more sold on, a lot more sold on plus one now that it
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.280]   appears in other websites, like plus plus one thing.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:30.920]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.960]   And in search results seem crazy to me because how do you know it's a good search
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.880]   result unless you've clicked on it and then you're gone.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.520]   We kind of assumed that that would happen though.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.240]   Yeah, we did.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:39.960]   We did.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.200]   But it does kind of feel like catch up to dig this and then Facebook's like, you know,
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.680]   and there's a button fatigue too.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.800]   And there's definitely right.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.240]   You have the NAS carsation.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.920]   That's why we want the big heart, the special heart button that just does it.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.560]   Boom.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:55.800]   Right.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.600]   The heart button, right.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.040]   And then you configure the services you want to share on and you just do it one shot.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:00.840]   I'm sure someone's going to.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.400]   We just gave you a great startup somebody.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.680]   Somebody who's listening right now.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.840]   Just gave you a great startup.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.960]   Somebody just shared, actually, I'm not going to say anything because I don't do
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.040]   NDA's or anything, but somebody sent me an email about a startup.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.840]   They had similar to this that was brilliant.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   And I'll tell you about it when they go public, but it was similar idea.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.400]   So that people are thinking about this.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.520]   And that's the thing is it's not going to come from Google.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.000]   I bet you.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.560]   It's going to come from some independent little guy.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.920]   I've been I've been really liking Stellar, which is Jason Kotke's new app,
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.320]   which is not open to the public yet.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:44.280]   Stellar.io, but it's an aggregation of people's favorites on Twitter and Flickr and Vimeo.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.080]   And it's really cool.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.280]   I can't wait for Jason to open it up.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.840]   Sorry, I shouldn't have brought up something that's not open yet.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.960]   So mean.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.120]   So mean.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.960]   I'll see if I have any invites.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.720]   I'll see if I can send you one.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.400]   I probably a member don't even know it because I joined everything.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.560]   Then I forget.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.000]   And I come back in a year and I go, oh, I already did that.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.400]   Already.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.240]   By the way, when we mentioned the Gmail mini hacking before, did we know it was China?
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.280]   No, Google's saying that now.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.960]   In fact, let's do that story in a second.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.920]   We're going to do that in just a moment.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.320]   I just want to briefly remind everybody it's kind of calls to Newcastle because I know you're all
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.240]   members about Netflix.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:23.960]   Here's the deal.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.760]   You know about Netflix, which is, of course, DVDs by mail and now that new watch instantly
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.880]   functionality, which means you can watch your favorite guys watch.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.320]   I'm going through all of the battle star 79 battle star galactic episodes.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.160]   I watch two and nine.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.120]   No commercials.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.040]   Boom, boom.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:40.840]   It's great.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.760]   Two and nine is 88 minutes.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.400]   It's perfect.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.320]   And then I fall asleep.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.120]   And the nice thing about by the way, Netflix says, watch instantly.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.800]   I'm watching it on a Roku box on my TV, but you could use a PlayStation three,
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.880]   Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, a lot of DVD players, a lot of TVs.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.400]   Is you go to sleep, you stop it and you go to sleep and you come back and you're
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.360]   watching the rest of the show.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.120]   I was watching it.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:02.520]   Okay.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.400]   Okay.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.440]   This is a little girly, but I was watching a Joni Mitchell biography last night.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.120]   No, I'm not with you.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.560]   I love Joni Mitchell.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.960]   Oh, I love her.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.840]   I love her.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.840]   And this is a really.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:20.120]   This is that somebody else.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.240]   I don't know what that is.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.520]   The album name is right.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.280]   This, I didn't even know this is, you know, but this is why I like watches
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.520]   to because partly it's the recommendation engine on Netflix, but sometimes you just,
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.360]   you know, you stumble across something.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.280]   I loved this documentary.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.720]   It's a, it was a PBS American Masters series, which I missed.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.080]   And, and, but it's available.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.360]   So here's the deal, which is fun.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.440]   By the way, see, I've seen, I fell asleep.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.320]   Look at this.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.280]   I watched 52 minutes of the 91 minutes total.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.720]   How does it know you fell asleep?
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.440]   Do you have like a kill?
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.080]   No, yes.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:51.960]   That's right.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.400]   If I'm not sitting on the Roku box, it turns off.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.160]   No, I, I turned it off before I went to sleep.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.440]   I didn't fall asleep in the middle.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.320]   I'm not that bad yet.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.000]   However, this is, this is what I love about this.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.080]   Now Netflix, of course, DVD by mail.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.120]   You get the Insta watch instantly and more and more movies all the time and TV shows.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.760]   Let's not forget.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.480]   Uh, do not rent white chicks.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.720]   Uh, you might see it there, but don't rent it.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.040]   Okay.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:25.080]   I'm just telling you, it's there, but you know, if you think Marlon Wayans and Sean Wayans
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.440]   dressed as white women is a funny thing, maybe you would want to rent that.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.680]   But anyway, that's your, the beauty of this is there's tens of thousands of movies.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.320]   You're not stuck.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.560]   Wuthering Heights.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.920]   I just watched the Pixar story.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.720]   It was so good.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.600]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.840]   I didn't even know that was on there.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.520]   Yeah, it's on watch instantly.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.560]   Really good.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.680]   So here's the deal.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.880]   I know you're already a member.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.080]   We're just, you know, we're telling you stuff you already know.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.120]   Please do me a favor.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:57.240]   Tell your friends, your family, your grandma to go to netflix.com/twit and sign up for
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.160]   twit and the effort on Netflix.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.280]   And that way we get the credit.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:00.520]   Okay.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.160]   Cause I, I, I realize it's too late now for you.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.720]   We, we've already joined.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.840]   And if you haven't, what?
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.440]   netflix.com/twit tried free for 30 days.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.960]   You will love it.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.320]   So, uh, China has been hacking Gmail.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.080]   Google announced this today.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:26.360]   They said, yes, we noticed unusual activity with people trying to steal Gmail passwords.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.280]   Hundreds of Gmail users, including US government officials, Chinese activists,
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:37.240]   and Chinese journalists have been tricked into sharing their passwords with what Google calls
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.040]   bad actors in China.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.920]   That's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.280]   That's just bad guys.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.080]   The attackers were able to read and forward the victim's email.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.600]   Sorry.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.160]   Take a minute.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.120]   Tcha-ka.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.920]   Tcha-ka.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.400]   Pata.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.680]   Stang.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   The web search company, which is a blame China for a previous stack on the company's computer
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.880]   network said it's security.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.920]   By the way, they're back in China, aren't they?
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.760]   Google got out of China, but didn't.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.000]   They are?
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.800]   Is there a change?
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.680]   I thought there was a change.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.480]   There's still not in China.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.040]   They just say they're.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040]   So they're, that's still true.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.920]   They're not in China.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.440]   Yeah, I think it's right.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.240]   Yeah, as far as I know.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.000]   They're, they're, they're, they're not there, right?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.760]   They're not like it kind of faded away like this.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.520]   Like, yeah, well, whatever.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.040]   So they're not.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.360]   There's still not like there's no office in China.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:22.920]   You can't do it.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.800]   No, there's an office there.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.680]   No, there always has been.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.600]   You can't do Google searches in China.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.800]   No, you can do Google searches in China.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.920]   It just goes to Hong Kong and they don't censor it there.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.320]   Ah, so they didn't support this Chinese censoring.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:33.720]   I get it.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:33.960]   Okay.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.520]   That's what I think.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.760]   I think a chat room will tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.240]   They will.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:37.880]   Yes.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.560]   And apparently they're still using Gmail in China because all these guys are using Gmail and
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.640]   Google said it's security and abuse detection system discovered
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.240]   a bunch of phishing scams and people are falling for them.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.920]   The campaign seems to originate from Gnon China.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.360]   Wow, they really know and it's targeting specific individuals.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.520]   High profile.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.520]   It's a high profile individual.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.880]   That's what's a little scary too.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.560]   Because Leo, you're high profile.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.640]   Yeah, but I don't, they don't Chinese government doesn't.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.040]   I think it sounds like it's people, they're going after, it sounds like it's Chinese government
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:12.440]   going after this.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.240]   Well, and US government officials and activists and journalists.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:15.480]   Right.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:22.680]   So they're using passwords to change the Gmail accounts forwarding settings and delegation
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.160]   settings.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.720]   Interesting.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.200]   Okay.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.400]   So then if you don't pay attention, what happens is your account continues as usual.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.160]   You don't know it, but they can read everything.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.280]   Right.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.440]   Interesting.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.000]   What's really interesting is that Google is so quickly saying it's coming from China.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.720]   The war is still long.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   So their recommendation is to implement their two-step verification process,
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.760]   which you and I were talking about before the show, Gina.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.000]   It's just so difficult.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.840]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.720]   It is a pain in the butt.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.800]   You need a two-step.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.960]   I'm a big fan of two-step authentication.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.240]   I use it on my bank account.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.800]   You know, it'll, I'll log in with my password and then it says,
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800]   okay, we're going to send you a code to the phone that you have in your possession and then
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.840]   you enter that code.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.200]   And that's really great because even if you got my password, you'd have to have my phone
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:12.840]   for it to work.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.320]   Right.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.280]   This isn't that easy.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.000]   It's not, no, it's not, it's not as easy.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.960]   You download, well, there's a few different ways, but you get a code, like a security code,
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.840]   but then in addition to the security code, you also have to create a per application password.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.200]   So if you want to log in to a Google app on another device, or if you have,
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.000]   if you granted other applications access to your Google data, it's going to be logged in with apps.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.880]   Yeah, I mean, right.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.200]   And for someone like you, Leo and me, to some extent, who uses so many apps and so many devices
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.240]   that you find yourself in this situation, and I found myself in this situation a couple times,
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.520]   where I haven't do a device.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.720]   I just want to sign into Gmail real quick or Google real quick to do something.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.960]   And it's like, oh, you know, I need to either set up this new application specific password
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.520]   or I have to grab my phone and check out the code again.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.800]   I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's security.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.880]   True, good security is inconvenient.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.600]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.640]   That's just the reality of it.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.120]   Right.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:02.600]   Right.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.080]   That's the trigger.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.200]   But I feel really good about it.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.680]   Now that I've enabled it, I wound up disabling a bunch of apps I didn't use anymore that still had access.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.760]   And, and I just, I feel like I know no one else is in my Gmail, which, which is good, which is good.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.280]   But I, you know, we should say that Google said, Google said that they detected and disrupted this
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.280]   campaign and they notified everyone who was affected and, and, and the relevant government
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.240]   authorities.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.520]   I mean, even if you don't want to set up two step authentication, it's always good to just
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.160]   go on your settings, figure out where your secondary email address is, make sure that's not some
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.600]   hot mail or your Oahu account that doesn't exist anymore, that someone else could have the name.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.040]   Just make sure that you have a valid secondary email address, change your password.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.400]   You know, once in a while, if you haven't done it in a while, that kind of thing.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.080]   I mean, you know, the most, the most important in my opinion, the most important thing you could do is
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.360]   to attach a cell phone number to your Google account.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.000]   Yes.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.640]   Because even if they pack your account, they get your password, you could always reset it
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.720]   through the phone and they don't have that probably.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.680]   Right. Right.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.440]   And just make sure that that stuff is all up to date and that's not your old cell phone five years ago.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:11.240]   You know, uses something like near field communications, let's say that as long as you have your phone,
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.800]   with it's like, it's like the new cars we're dealing with the car.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.440]   Right. Yeah.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.160]   Right.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.080]   And the chips there and let's just start the car, which freaked me out at first, but that's fine.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.200]   What if I had the same kind of thing where if I'm near a computer, it says, okay, that's you.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.360]   And I have a very easily report. If I don't have that, it's kind of like biometrics,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.080]   but instead of biometrics, it's phonometrics. Yeah.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:31.880]   It's easier.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.600]   That's always up like that.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.440]   Yeah. You'd need to have all computers would have to have an NFC receiver.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.320]   Yes, they would.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.000]   But that's a good idea. I like that.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.280]   There's some way to make security stuff a lot easier and more powerful.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.320]   Well, there's the thumbprint.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.680]   You know, I mean, there's thumbprint, right?
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.120]   There's eye scans, which are less less common.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.560]   I always feel like I'm going to get blinded.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.920]   Like a pep.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.840]   Oh, gotcha.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.320]   Gotcha.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.760]   I just took a screenshot and now I will be able to scan Jeff's image anywhere and authenticate
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.960]   a M.C. This is this is the problem with the hyper local or hyper public existence, Jeff.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.440]   Yes.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.760]   You're irises are on file.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.640]   She's got your eye right.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.920]   You can.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.120]   I missed it again.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.920]   I keep doing it again so I can press the screen capture button.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.320]   Now he won't do it now.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.120]   We got it.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:26.680]   Okay, good.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.560]   You can get in the country.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.080]   All right, Gina, I got a question for you.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.200]   Because every time this comes up, you defend Twitter.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.840]   When they screw developers and do one more thing.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.880]   Oh, they do it again?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.680]   They do it again for them.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.720]   And I wonder where you have a breaking point here with them.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.120]   It seemed like they're I was the word predatory in fantaside.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.480]   Wow.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.440]   Oh, they're going to kill wife frog and put all of these other companies.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:03.320]   I think it was Raffar Ali said today that, you know, name one thing, one real innovation
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.160]   that's actually come from Twitter, Inc.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.080]   Versus came from the community of developers that Twitter then takes over.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:09.400]   Right.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.280]   I just I don't I still friendly to them.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.400]   I you know, so we're talking about photos, obviously, right?
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   So they're launching a partnership with Photo Bucket to easily post photos.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.600]   And and essentially kind of taking over, right?
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.520]   All the photo posting apps.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.880]   Yeah, it's so funny, Jeff, because I just I feel like you're the guy who's like, you know,
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.240]   business isn't about being nice.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.600]   It's about making money, right?
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.480]   So I mean, you're the developer.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.240]   And so it just seems to me that that it's it's it's a risk for a platform to start and say,
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.800]   we're a platform, you can develop on top of us.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.520]   And then you don't know when that day is going to come on, like I said, okay,
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.720]   rug, rug, rug, rug, rug, pull out all the rugs from under you.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:47.880]   Right.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.120]   Right.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.960]   And you you the developer community built all of the really interesting technology
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.760]   and standards atop them and the user community as well.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.560]   Right.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:57.880]   And.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.040]   No, it's interesting is they they're actually partnering with photo bucket.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.520]   So there is a winner, which is photo bucket.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.560]   Photo bucket, right.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.600]   So, you know, it's interesting.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:06.920]   I don't know.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.520]   Maybe I should be more outraged about this,
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.360]   but this is kind of got and I'm not going to upset all the photo sharing,
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.720]   the Twitter photo sharing developers.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   And I'm really sorry in advance, but I got to tell you that I think that sharing short links
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:25.080]   to photos on Twitter, like it just isn't the most innovative thing in the world.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.760]   There are lots of services that do photo sharing anyway.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.040]   And like, I don't I don't know.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.160]   I never really understood.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.080]   I never really well, I mean, you know, Instagram, that was something that was just it was such a
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.840]   it was just a complete.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.360]   I just never understood it.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.320]   Um, so I kind of feel like for Twitter to grow and be a platform and actually what's cool about
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.800]   this photo thing is that it's based on Twitter annotation.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.560]   So you're going to actually be able to include interesting metadata, you know,
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.000]   it's kind of an open way to include interesting metadata of all kinds of media,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.400]   not just pictures and videos in tweets.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.080]   And that's super interesting to me as a developer.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:57.480]   Okay.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.760]   So stop there.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.640]   Go ahead.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.440]   Can you use that or can you get that only if you use the Twitter photo sharing app?
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.160]   Anybody can use that from what I understand.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.920]   Yeah, Twitter annotations that the annotations, the metadata will be included
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.000]   with tweets through all the APIs or maybe except for maybe the search API, which is getting,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.920]   deprecated.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.120]   And that's that makes Twitter even more of a platform.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.760]   Well, it gives you more data for for think up.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.440]   Yeah, it gives me more data.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:24.920]   Exactly.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.760]   And listen, I do I feel bad for the Y frogs and the pick pleases and all these sites that have
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.000]   sort of built a business on sharing photos on Twitter.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.880]   But I also kind of feel like this makes a lot of sense for Twitter.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.600]   They chose a partner and and, you know, as a business,
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.400]   this is kind of.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.760]   I think it's I think it's categorically different from clients
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:49.080]   because when you're a wife or a twit pick, you're really you're really a lamprey eel on,
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.520]   you know, your parasite on the service.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.480]   Whereas if I'm building an application that has that allows me to tweet or has tweets in it,
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:03.000]   I think that's more that's adding more value than just kind of piggybacking on the service.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.840]   It seems it seems different somehow to me.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.640]   Right.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.680]   Ironically, there were the that was the third party clients at Twitter is probably going to
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.280]   put out a business, but right, right.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.760]   Well, not if the third party clients do something.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.160]   If they had to, they add more value, right?
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.480]   So you look at seismic or you look at tweet deck where they're incorporating not just tweets,
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.640]   but Facebook, you know, status message.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.200]   So what if what if Twitter did tomorrow?
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.720]   What think up us?
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.280]   I'd be really bummed.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:32.920]   I would.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.480]   Absolutely.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.640]   And a lot of ways Twitter is doing Twitter is doing more with analytics, which is a lot of
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.360]   much of what what think of does Twitter does not offer.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.760]   You know, our big sell is like we archive your tweets.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.720]   You can't get your tweets back from 2007 to 2008 from Twitter right now, but you can if you're running think up.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.840]   I'm sure that at some point they're going to roll those tweets out of cold storage
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.440]   and make them available to everyone, right?
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.920]   I mean, even Facebook, you can download your profile now.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.040]   But that's always the risk when you build on top of somebody else's platform.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.000]   It absolutely is.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.960]   It absolutely is.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.320]   I mean, you know, part of what we do think of is we're networking specific,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.880]   we make plugins for different, you know, for lots of different networks,
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.240]   much like TweetDeck did, like with Facebook and Four Square and Buzz.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.440]   I mean, TweetDeck is a really interesting, you know, situation.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.800]   I mean, you've got tons of data on your desktop from all your friends.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.080]   I mean, TweetDeck could could have really done and I would love to see them do,
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.680]   but I think they're probably going to kill it now.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.320]   TweetDeck could have done some really interesting,
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.920]   search all the things that my friends have said,
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.400]   show me sentiment analysis of all my friends, right?
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.360]   Because it's constantly downloading your friends status updates onto your desktop,
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.120]   which is like, you've got tons of storage there.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.520]   Anyway, just to be clear, yes, I'd be really bummed out if Twitter--
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.080]   I'm just trying to--
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:37.400]   I'm just trying to--
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.520]   I mean, it's an honest question because I'm really trying to figure out where the line is
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.920]   of predatory behavior versus, hey, it's business.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.880]   Your son Jake wrote apps for Facebook.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.560]   And surely when he did that, he knew that well, you know, I live at the--
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.920]   What Facebook did the opposite?
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.200]   Facebook killed its own apps because they said that developers would do a better job.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.960]   So the most successful one he wrote was courses.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.240]   Facebook killed courses.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.720]   Jake wrote the one that became the number one courses he's told it.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.080]   That was fun.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:16.040]   As Zuckerberg, you know, talked about how Zinga now has higher market cap than electronic arts.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.640]   You know, he bragged about the platform in Paris,
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:24.040]   and the platform is kind of to me in terms of your Jake level developers
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.600]   has gone nowhere because you can't be discovered.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:26.920]   Right.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.720]   It's possible--
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.280]   Too many apps.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:28.840]   --it's quite--
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.800]   But at the very high level at Zinga, you know, it's great.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.320]   It's not too much of a business.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.120]   And, you know, Zuckerberg argued that the next successful--
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.880]   I think we want to talk about this, the next successful music company we want.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.600]   That which understands people and music at the same time, i.e. Lady Gaga, you know,
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.560]   same for TV, same for news, same for other things.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.240]   So he's still seeing it as a platform where I don't think he's competing.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:53.880]   He's not doing anything.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.720]   It does seem a little cheerlish because Twitter--
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.840]   I think that's a very good point.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.040]   Twitter didn't invent anything.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.480]   The @reply, the direct--
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.040]   Everything was invented by third parties in Twitter,
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.240]   incorporated it and said, "Thanks."
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.280]   Because it was a beautiful thing.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.160]   We'll see you later.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.120]   Right.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:06.840]   I love it.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.800]   I love it.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.360]   I love that.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.960]   Unless you go and then kind of screw the people who added value to you.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.920]   That's what bothers me.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.440]   I know what you're saying.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.240]   I mean, it seems like Twitter adds these features and takes over these clients
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.360]   because they want to make it easy for new users to discover these things.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.440]   I mean, I think Facebook as an app platform is just--
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   apps are a lot more easily discoverable.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.920]   I mean, I think it makes sense that Twitter wants to incorporate image sharing
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.360]   into their own app, with their own partner and have some sort of control over that
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.600]   because they want more people to upload more pictures.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.440]   Right now, uploading pictures, a new user, someone who's not us,
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.040]   is like, "What service do I use?
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:40.840]   What are these links?
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.040]   All these different sites?
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.680]   Why does YFrog act this way and Twitter act that way?"
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.520]   I mean, this has been their argument, right, that it's a user experience thing.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.960]   I think that's a fair argument.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.880]   I think with ThinkUp Federation and data ownership,
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.600]   like owning your own data and archiving your own data and your friends' data
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.040]   is high on my list of priorities.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.120]   And I know that's not high on Twitter's list of priorities.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:04.600]   That's where I'm making my bet, right, among other little analytical things.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.240]   Right. Thank you.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.400]   We're running out of time.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.000]   So I hate to do this because we still haven't talked about Google Wallet.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.320]   That happened right after our show last week.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.680]   We'll save that.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.720]   We'll think about it some more.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.560]   I got a quick question for both of you.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.200]   Yes.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.400]   Should I buy a Chrome notebook?
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.160]   Oh my God.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.280]   They're doing a sale on guilt right now, guilt.com.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.080]   And I'm so aggravated because they listed the freaking Chromebook in the men's section.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.320]   Man.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.760]   Right next to Drakkar Noir.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.880]   Fail.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.520]   We're loving feminists, not happy, not happy.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.480]   I mean, honestly, I don't know what other section they could list it in.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.360]   I mean, their sections are women men, home, children, gifts,
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.240]   all jets, etc.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.200]   It's fine.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.800]   City, taste.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.760]   I think you should quick guilt right now.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.920]   You know, I just signed up for guilt recently because Sarah and Veronica were talking about it on
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.240]   sweat.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.720]   And but they're way more stylish than I am.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.800]   Like I started looking at clothing and I was just like, oh man.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm gonna say invite to fab.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.840]   Oh boy.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.320]   Okay.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:11.800]   Fab?
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.520]   I don't.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.360]   Fab is all about design.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.320]   Not close.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.280]   But design.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.600]   All right.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.880]   So Samsung's new Chromebook is now available on guilt.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.360]   The sale begins.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.800]   Oh, it began.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.080]   It happened.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:29.800]   It's on now.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.320]   That began this morning, I think.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.120]   And how much is it?
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.080]   Does it say?
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.840]   Morning, I'm for the one with the.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.800]   Yeah, that's expensive.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.040]   Hotter megs of 3G included.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.840]   I guess now I have to become a member of guilt.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.680]   Trap, I think it depends on what your use case is.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.400]   You know, I don't know.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.960]   Do you think you have a MacBook Air?
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.440]   I mean, do you have a use for a really lightweight laptop?
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.360]   I have a regular MacBook Pro.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.720]   I guess the question is, do I need it to kind of blow up on my understanding about how the
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:02.360]   world operates?
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.200]   So when I teach journalism students and things.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.080]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.720]   Here's what you do.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:10.440]   You just take all the applications off of your care.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.760]   Except Chrome.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.040]   Except Chrome, yes.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:14.520]   That's it.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.120]   That's the same.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.320]   Right?
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.920]   Basically.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.640]   It starts up a lot faster than the Mac.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.200]   Okay, so just, you know, forget that part.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.800]   Always keep Chrome running and then just open the lid.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.280]   And that's it.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.240]   You're there.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.680]   I'll send you the CR 48.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.160]   If I could just found the power supply, I'll send it to you.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.520]   But it's just, that's all it is.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.000]   It's the browser.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.440]   So take everything off your computer.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.160]   Pretend you have no storage.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.760]   So I can't store any file there.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:42.920]   No.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.440]   Well, no, you can.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.040]   Can't you can't you download photos?
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.000]   I mean, you can.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.040]   There's a file here.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.720]   It has a memory slot.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.000]   You may be like on an SD card.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.160]   Because I think it's a very small memory machine.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.360]   Yeah, I think it's very small.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.640]   So you wouldn't want to put, you know, a bunch of pictures on it.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:01.880]   Right.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.480]   No, no, I mean, you're buying like a document.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.200]   I'm writing or something.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.480]   Uh, good luck.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.520]   Or found that offline.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.000]   Uh, can you work offline on it?
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:11.400]   You can.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.600]   All right.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.360]   I don't know.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.400]   I'm looking at chat rooms.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.640]   It says 16 gigabytes of memory on this thing.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.080]   So I guess you could save some documents.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.640]   You had there's a file browser now.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.440]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.040]   So now there's a browser and a file.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:26.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.200]   Right on.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:28.840]   I wouldn't get it.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.680]   I wouldn't.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.480]   I see the new shiny thing and you can get it early.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.760]   I think you'd be better off getting a tab.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.000]   The galaxy tab 10.1.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.640]   No, I think that's that'd be better.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.440]   I'm gonna kind of tabbed out right now.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:45.720]   Too many tabs.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.240]   Yeah, but writing a document, you do let you want that keyboard.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:49.720]   That's true.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.240]   That's true.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.280]   Are we get we're supposed to get one, right?
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.320]   We're gonna send this one, right?
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.440]   Yeah, they are gonna send us one.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.360]   I guess if I disclose that I can keep it.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.760]   I'll send it to Jeff.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.520]   I'll send it to Jeff.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.320]   Don't buy one Jeff.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.040]   I'll send you mine.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.040]   Let us get our tool tip and pick of the week starting with Gina Tarpani's tip.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.520]   Two new things in Gmail.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.680]   One super exciting nested labels.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.320]   This was a labs feature that actually got promoted to built in Gmail.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.000]   I don't know.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.880]   It could be just because I was at Life Hacker and people were just appalled
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.480]   that it didn't support sub folders or sub tags when Gmail first launched.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.120]   But now it does.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.960]   So when you create a new label, you can create a nested label inside of it.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.000]   So one way I use this is I'm subscribed to a bunch of mailing lists.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.160]   So I have a mailing list parent label and then each sub label is the name of the list.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.840]   For those of you who are hyperorganized.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.280]   And also Gmail launched last week a people widget.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.520]   When you're in Gmail, if you look on the right side,
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.000]   you'll see photos and descriptions and contact information about all the people
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.520]   participating in a conversation.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.560]   Has you just rolled out?
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.680]   Kind of interesting.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.200]   I haven't seen it on mine yet.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:58.920]   Yep, yep.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.440]   And I'm using Google Apps too.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.320]   And I am seeing it.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.160]   The people widget you mean?
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.520]   Yeah, I don't have a people widget yet.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.360]   Yeah, and it kind of makes you, you can see which one of your friends have actually set a
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.680]   Google profile photo as you see their photo.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.080]   And you can see mail from this month.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.920]   I mean, it shows you kind of it's actually similar to Facebook's kind of friendship with
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.760]   this person, kind of interactions that you had with a person and documents you shared.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.400]   Oh, yeah, you're not saying that.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.280]   Just saying.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.360]   If you look at an email from someone with a Gmail account, maybe,
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360]   I don't know, I'm seeing it from every domain.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.080]   I must be rolling out.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.400]   So yeah, they said they were rolling it out bit by bit.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.600]   Yep.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.720]   So people widget and nested labels.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.120]   Nested labels.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.320]   I have finally nested labels.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.680]   They've needed that for a while, I think.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.000]   Yes.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.880]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:48.680]   Number of the week.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.040]   I'm going to be between two of the months.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:50.920]   Yeah, I'll go with this one.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:27:00.920]   Uh, it is 500,000, which is how much Google paid epic, the electronic privacy information center
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.200]   for its buzz screw up.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   And they're going to say that's all a quarter, right?
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:04.920]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.280]   Yeah, that's what's irritating here.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.280]   And it's on top of earlier settlements with other organizations, like EFF and such.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.960]   And I understand in theory, this is their Mitzvah back there.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.680]   They're, they're, they're, they're going to come up.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.520]   It compensates them for their efforts.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.160]   Well, but, but why do they get the money?
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:23.400]   Right.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.080]   You see, it's bothering me because it's kind of the, the, what I call the,
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.400]   regulatory industrial complex of privacy now.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.120]   Right.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.520]   So by complaining, they're making money off complaining.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.160]   And I don't like that, but that's why I just wanted to go.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.520]   Actually, Google issued that objection.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.080]   They said they did not want the funds to go to the organizations.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.760]   Yeah, but they, but they did a whole bunch of settlements and they did it all.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:50.120]   And I think that, that sets the, uh, expectations and, and then motivations in the wrong way.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:57.000]   And it makes privacy into even more of a, uh, gold mine for complainers.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.680]   So I just wanted to get it off my chest.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.800]   And while I'm doing this, I have a very, very small piece and I triple E spectrum.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.640]   Now I wanted to talk about that, but you and Gina are both mentioned in this.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.920]   Gina is quoted galore in it and the new issue coming up.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   And they wanted me to plug it on twig, which I like that, that somebody wants to be plugged
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.240]   on twig.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.000]   So for that, we'll plug it on to make.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:17.800]   We'll go for that.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.080]   The IEEE spectrum, you wrote a piece called public, I'm sorry, privacy,
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.480]   publicness and the web, a manifesto.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.240]   Well, it's actually one third of the story that I wrote, but we didn't agree on the editing
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.600]   the rest, but it's fine.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.040]   And so that's kind of bookish stuff.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.960]   And then Gina is quoted by crazy in predictions of the next five things they're going to control
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.360]   the web.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.720]   She has wonderful quotes in there.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.120]   I agree.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.240]   Oh, thank you.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.360]   And you can read this online.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.960]   Yes, you can read online.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.520]   It's all online.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.280]   The IEEE spectrum is spectrum dot IEEE dot org.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.280]   Thank you for the one for them.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:48.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.560]   I was, I actually put it in my, uh, I booked, marked it.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.680]   I was going to talk about it anyway.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.200]   And I forgot.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.120]   So, or actually ran out of time.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.560]   I want to thank Gina for this tool.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.880]   I actually had a tool that was very obscure.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.160]   And it's really a more of a news story, but it happened today.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:09.880]   Google has released a developer preview of web RTC, which is their real time voice and video chat
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.560]   system based on HTML and JavaScript.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.520]   This is a direct competitor for Skype and FaceTime.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:23.720]   And developers are now being encouraged to use it to develop video conferencing systems.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.880]   Uh, and I guess, uh, take that Cisco too.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   Cisco's, that's the big player here, right?
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.720]   And I guess the idea is if you have a Chromebook, you'd still be able to do conferencing on the Chromebook.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:45.000]   So, um, this is a, this is an interesting release, not of much use, uh, to anybody who's not a developer,
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.320]   but, uh, I'm sure Kevin Marks is looking at it.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.880]   And then thank you, Gina, because-
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.040]   You can also show an example of location based on the real time communication APIs we've made
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.080]   available on labs.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.440]   And this is an Erickson video.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.800]   You can watch this later.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.200]   Go ahead.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:05.400]   This is, this is Gina's tip to me for a tool that I didn't know about called Google Correlate.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.760]   It comes out of the Google labs.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.920]   It's got 100 points for that.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.120]   You're not knowing about it.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.400]   I, uh, is this new?
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.200]   I never did this.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.800]   I hadn't either, but now that you have it, I don't feel so bad.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.200]   Oh no.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.840]   So I'll search for what I just search, do a search, right?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.160]   You enter, you enter a search and then what happens?
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.680]   It searches for correlations.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.480]   I don't understand it.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.280]   It's like, it's-
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.360]   When I search for a split, I get seven minutes in heaven.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:29.640]   Is that-
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.000]   It's like searches that have had similar patterns over time.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.880]   Some of the examples are a little better.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.880]   So correlated with the, with winter, you get searches for Nordica,
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.920]   colds, hockey arenas, and Obermeyer.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:47.880]   Uh, uh, searches that were most likely to be issued in 2005,
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.520]   so you can compare it to time series and stuff.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.640]   It's, you know what?
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.200]   I love it.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:57.480]   This is another big data thing where if you've got a lot of data looking for correlations,
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:02.920]   and, uh, and information that you can, you can, uh, deduce from that data.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.920]   And it's great that Google lets us play with it a little bit.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:09.640]   So it's, uh, correlate.googlelabs.com.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.000]   So there's two tools for you.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.360]   Uh, on your level of expertise, Gina Trapati.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:18.520]   Kevin, Kevin Marks just corrected me that he wanted me to say,
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:22.120]   and he, and he actually, he's right that the Twitter photos are not Twitter annotations,
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.680]   that they're actually tweet entities, which are a different thing.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.440]   The Twitter annotations has not launched yet.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.800]   So I stand corrected.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:33.800]   Uh, my, my declaration that the Twitter platform has just opened up to everything is now,
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.000]   is it was absolutely wrong.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:35.720]   So I apologize.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.200]   Thanks, Kevin.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.120]   But I imagine that those photos are available in the API as part of the API.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.240]   It's just not an annotate.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.200]   Right.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:42.760]   Exactly.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   Well, we got to talk more about Twitter annotations and what that's going to be used for.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.120]   I think that's very interesting with her.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.280]   If it ever launches, it's been a long time.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.240]   They announced a long time ago.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.200]   They did.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.720]   Ah, Gina Trapani is at smarter where.org.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.680]   She's also think up app.com sometime soon.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.120]   We'll all be able to think up.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:00.760]   I can't wait.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.840]   Can't wait.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.720]   You could also follow her on the Twitter @gina trapani.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.240]   Oh, good one.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.200]   Set it right once.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.080]   You did.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:09.640]   You did.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.280]   Great show today, guys.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:12.600]   Thank you.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.240]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   Thank you.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.360]   Really interesting stuff.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.080]   Yeah, as always.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.360]   Jeff Jarvis is the best.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.760]   He's at buzzmachine.com.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.040]   You're the highlight of the week, boss.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:27.320]   Professor of CU at CUNY or CUNY as it is known to its proponents at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.680]   and the author of this fine book, What Would Google Do?
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.080]   And now we hear September for public parts.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:33.720]   That's exciting.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.320]   Can't wait.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.000]   All right.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.560]   And I'm going to buy you guys a brick because I like you so much.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.040]   Oh, I'm buying a brick.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:42.680]   I'm buying a brick.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.720]   Are you buying a brick?
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.280]   I'm buying a brick.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.480]   Brick.twit.tv.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.600]   We could not figure out what to say.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.720]   Put your name on the wall.
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:54.680]   You could get a-- if you get the 8x8, you could put a logo and get a picture of your penis or something on there.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.320]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.280]   Representative Wiener has already asked us for that.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:58.680]   So that--
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.320]   I think I'm going to have to have gleeke online.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.480]   Gina Trappani.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:03.800]   Gleeke.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.200]   Gleeke.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:04.760]   Gleeke.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:07.080]   Oh, sadly, I can do that now on the smaller brick.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:08.920]   It'll fit, huh?
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:12.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.320]   Hey, thank you, guys.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.120]   Always a pleasure.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.760]   We do twig this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.360]   That would be 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.160]   But download it after the fact, too, because we've got audio and video.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.040]   It's fun.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:26.600]   And it's all over.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:26.840]   You can see the--
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:27.000]   You can see the--
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:27.560]   --hair.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.040]   --on the--
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.400]   --you can see my hair.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.160]   Twit.tv/tweeg.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.120]   Because we're going to find that.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.360]   Or on better podcast clients everywhere.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.480]   This concludes this portion of this week in Google.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.520]   Yes, Tom, you can come in.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.200]   TNT is coming up next.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.960]   We'll see you later, everybody.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:56.920]   By the way, the brick is being offered in the men's section.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.880]   Thank you, everything.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.080]   That was good.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:01.960]   I like that, Gina.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.600]   That was great.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.040]   That was good.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.400]   It's a men's thing.
