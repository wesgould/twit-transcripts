[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.760]   It's time for twig this week in Google the show where we cover Google and this is a very good day to watch
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.360]   For a lot of reasons of course, this is Google I/O and coming to us from the Google plexin Mountain View
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.440]   We've got a great team. We'll start with
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.600]   Oh, who did it start with it's so great. Let's start with Jason Howell who is of course the host of all about Android last
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.680]   I had some great Google developers on the show and was at the keynote. Hi Jason
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.040]   How's it going Leo? It's good today T&T will be hosted by Megan because you're gonna spend the whole year spending the rest of the week there
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.080]   Yeah, well, I'm here to Friday
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480]   You know normally at Google I/O they give you you know
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.600]   Obviously the talks and there's a lot of people here to talk to and everything
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.280]   They also usually have a big demonstration area for things and I'm told that there is a whole lot of that going on this year
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's where I normally spend a lot of my time. So we'll see what happens. Yeah, I remember in years past at Moscone
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.160]   There were we booths and very interesting things to do and stuff. It's a different Google I/O
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.640]   We'll talk about that in just a second also here Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.800]   Wearing his swag. He's got a do rag and
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.280]   It's not a it's not a it's not a do rag. It's a gurag. It's a gurag from Google
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.360]   but
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.800]   What is is there something pretty googling about it or is it just well?
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.840]   See I was amused that mother at Google sent us all emails before we got here saying children
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.240]   It could be very chilly amount of view in the morning. You should all bring good sweater
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.320]   They said bring a thick sweater. I thought well then give us a hoodie. Yeah, so instead they give us they give us some
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   Screen and this well you need that because this is the first time I can remember a major tech keynote outside
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.200]   Out of doors nature. We don't go. Geeks don't do nature. I know
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.880]   Good to have you by the way, they're all in the same room. So occasionally you'll hear some cross chatter
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.080]   You know who's not in the same room, but has joined us and I'm so thrilled
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.000]   Gina Trapani is here. Hi Gina
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.280]   From New York City from New York in the white room. Yes the white actually she's at her new place
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.720]   Of employee. I am I'm at post-light what now tell us about okay, so
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.680]   When we when we came out to New York you said just on the QT. I've had a very interesting interview
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.320]   And so the good news is what is post-light?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.400]   Post-light is a new digital agency in New York
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   So we do client services we build apps and websites and platforms and all sorts of little digital things for for clients
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.960]   Some really cool interesting clients. It was founded by Paul Ford who people here might know him
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.280]   He was the author of that that amazing bluebird business week piece
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.880]   What is code and and rich ziadi who was a founder readability and
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.280]   Yeah, it's a really really fun team. I'm having a lot of fun very cool post-light
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.080]   P-o-s-t-l-i-g-h-t dot-com
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   And you're the CTO now is that right? I'm a director of engineering director of engineering even better
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.440]   Well, congratulations on the new thing now. Does this mean that think up is?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.800]   Still going on or what's the status with think up think up is alive and well and going strong as is maker base
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.040]   We we did write a little bit about think up on our blog blog that think up about that calm
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.560]   You know, we we have sort of reckoned with the fact that think up isn't it does the business model for it as a standalone
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.560]   Product doesn't work. So we're trying to figure out, you know
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.200]   How can we how can we keep think up around and maybe pass it on to someone who can who can keep it going and maybe as an add-on to a
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.160]   Different product or or as an additional offering we're trying to figure that out
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.640]   But we we wrote about it on the blog blog.thinkup.com in the meantime
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.160]   The services, you know, we're running think up. We're working on it
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.720]   That's I'm keep keeping that going and Neil and I and maker base as well. Good because I love both of them
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   I think they're both great ideas
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.600]   but sometimes one must gain gainful employment and
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.560]   Sounds like post-light's gonna be a lot of fun for you
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   And of course we love having Gina here
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.520]   Because she was original member of the cast and I'm hoping we can get more time with you
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.440]   Although sounds like as director engineering you're gonna be just as busy if not more so but we also love having a developer
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.040]   Especially for Google I/O so we appreciate you spending some time with us today. Thanks for having me
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.640]   Also from the Google plex mr. Matt cuts is here great to have you Matt
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   Oh, you shaved the beard man
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   Good unmute the unmute Matt's Mike we had muted it. It's my dis muke. There you go. Mute. Mest might is muked
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.400]   You can probably talk now Matt
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.480]   Anyway, no, no, we hear him now here. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Thanks for being here
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.280]   Absolutely happy to be here was kind of exciting wasn't it? This is a first time ever at the Shoreline Amphitheater
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.800]   Can you remember anybody an outdoor keynote ever before I don't?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   I think I think we've ever done something like that. I know Google hasn't I think Moses was the last time
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   Moses yes, I have some commandments for you
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.960]   That was the last time we had now it's like you know
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.720]   These are the thinnest lightest commandments we've ever made
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.160]   So let's start with Matt now. I know your Google employee
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.440]   But could contextualize what we saw today for us
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.000]   What does it all mean?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.200]   Well, I really liked that
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.760]   Google is not giving up on trying to figure out getting messaging right and you know
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.840]   Some of the stuff like aloe
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.800]   I think is really interesting because you've always got people who can criticize and they can say oh it's gonna do this or what about
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.200]   This or that but I think it's really promising to see
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.880]   Google really not willing to give this up yet
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.840]   We're gonna try to figure out what makes the right sense for for Android and for iOS
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.280]   How do you get a platform?
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.800]   And then there was also this underlying backbone of artificial intelligence and machine learning?
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.440]   Where whether it's Google Home or aloe all the way through a lot of the different things you could see soon
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.680]   Darmenching that and as a web guy
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   I was really happy to hear him call out progressive web apps and the accelerated mobile pages because you know to have the CEO saying
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.600]   Hey, this is important and here's the kind of speed improvement you can get I think that's really nice
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   I actually stand corrected
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:08.920]   Windows 95 launch was an outdoor launch. I think in a big Seattle event, but what?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.400]   Windows 95 launch had
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.840]   Which the Google launch did not have is a bunch of geeks biting their lower lips and dancing
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   in the most ungainly fashion
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.440]   Possible
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.080]   Thank you, we're not gonna dance. No dancing. No dancing. No, I agree with you
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.240]   In fact, I've been wondering for a while what Google was gonna do in messaging, you know, here's Facebook announcing bots
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.000]   apples coming on strong with messages
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.680]   Google kind of looked like they were hangouts was kind of abandoned when I got my Google 5 phone and said oh don't use hangouts use messages and
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   I thought well
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.280]   What are you doing Google? You're leaving this on the table. So
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.560]   In fact, I would say overall and I'd love to hear what you guys think my sense of this is
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.320]   Google's in a challenging position because they're kind of capitalizing on
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.280]   Something that's been going on for 10 years is machine learning platform
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.680]   Artificial intelligence is getting smarter and smarter, but it's not it's not like a revolutionary new product
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.040]   So it's not like they can say hey as Apple might we've had this under the covers for 10 years
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   Here's machine learning. No, but what I do think is that they're finally step do they're stepping forward in saying?
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.440]   You know when I when I see other companies doing things with bots and messaging Google didn't jump on that bandwagon
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.120]   They worked on it and they had something very compelling with I think Aloe and we'll talk about it
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   Same thing with you know, I was looking at my Amazon Echo
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.720]   Gosh, you know, where's Google and all this and Apple and Microsoft and everybody else and they've responded
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.920]   and I think so
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.400]   These are these are evolutionary products, but they are a very exciting product. You agree Jeff
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.540]   Yeah, I think I think it is interesting that that Google is playing catch-up. Let's be honest to Amazon with
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.360]   echo now home to
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.160]   Facebook with WhatsApp and now Aloe and to
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.280]   FaceTime with
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.640]   duo
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:21.400]   So that feels a little yucky that it's catch-up on the other hand if you think of the advantages that Google has in these areas that the
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.960]   It knows more about me in my needs it has the the artificial intelligence at work
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:34.240]   It has certainly the national language processing and the database of language that beats anybody and so what's really important today
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.280]   I think is Google assistant and the fact that it
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.140]   It's kind of the overarching capability to all of these products. Well, I don't understand is I guess in a sense Google had to start
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.080]   Aloe so it had a platform for that
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.360]   But I would imagine that that that underlying intelligence Google knows you Google will anticipate what your needs are and be assistive to you
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.240]   Could occur across many many platforms in many directions and that's where that goes
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.320]   The you know the be honest. I think though with aloe aloe whatever how you say it?
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   Hello, hello, hello
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.760]   is is that it
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.480]   Sorry to bring this up Gina, but it does have a little bit of the sniff of wave
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.960]   But that no in a good way in a good way
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.040]   Yeah in a good way, but but it's it's kind of like
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.320]   Do they have to go through a lot of hoops to raise this up and get their big adoption?
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.560]   Which could lose the attention to the underlying technology, which is really good
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.360]   God, I hope not I mean you're saying not to you're saying that we're a little snake
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.240]   Bit from all of the great things that Google has announced and abandoned over time
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.080]   And it's getting hard for Google to say oh, we got a new messaging app
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.600]   This is the one you want to use you should all use it and move all your contacts over there
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.400]   That gets on the same as that's gonna be very hard
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.160]   So my fear is people are gonna say well
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.240]   They did messaging it sure failed when that's not the point the point and neither is the point to shout or whisper
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.680]   That was kind of silly, but it'll be fun the idea that you could make your text larger or smaller with a little slighter
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.240]   Padre and I was standing around when Jason was trying to to message Colleen here to make sure we were all in sequence
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.560]   And so we just we've been said you know just shout it and she'll hear it
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.760]   So
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.600]   My my fear is that I think people will look at the numbers of aloe and say well Google tries again
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.320]   And that's not really the point the underlying technology and the underlying
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:33.640]   New relationship it has with me to truly be my it's the bottom all bots. That's what it's really about. I think that's kind of how I feel Jason
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.600]   how
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.040]   You know we've all kind of at this point kind of made fun of and experienced the Facebook bots and how annoying
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.320]   They feel like stalkers. I had a kind of finally just I
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.400]   Literally had the block
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.560]   That stupid weather one. I couldn't turn it off. I can't say cancel stop go away finally had a block it
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.680]   This seems it feels to me Jason like this is Google has got has done it right
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.280]   This is how bots ought to be you're really not talking to a bot
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.640]   You're talking about an intermediary who then summons the appropriate bot. Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to that
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   I want to kind of dig in a little bit on
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.560]   Kind of that interaction with assistant from within the messaging app
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.360]   I will say though that I feel a little stung at this point kind of what you were talking about Jeff right like
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.720]   I feel like there's so many different like outside of just Google's efforts in messaging just messaging in general
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.360]   Yes, it's super important, but it's like even for today
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.560]   Just kind of coordinating this meeting. I have so many different options
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.200]   I have a folder filled with messaging options every new entrant to the category
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.360]   Be you know brings with it more confusion on what person is attached to that particular messaging platform?
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.880]   I think that the things that aloe is offering are new they're different
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.440]   They're they're interesting because it's kind of that smart contextual stuff behind the scenes
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.420]   I just wonder why it wasn't I don't know sandwiched into something they already had that because I think kind of splintering it out
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.020]   Into its own thing might send the wrong message to people
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:11.000]   I know what do you think Jana? I don't know. I think maybe the weariness with all the different app choices might be an early adopter problem
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.340]   And maybe not I mean stream problem
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.420]   I mean I get it
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.880]   I mean I think the messaging problems
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.960]   I think of people and then think oh are they on fate?
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.480]   You know like on a Facebook did I hang out with them last like what was the last way that I communicated with this person?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.720]   Successfully and then I go to that app and that's a problem had a bigger bigger than Google
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.860]   But as for aloe, I mean I and I was saying please don't say wave
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.860]   I mean
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:39.820]   They were introducing a whole new category of app like there really wasn't anything like wave before and that it just you know
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.760]   Was a conglomeration of a bunch of things. It's very clear what aloe is right like it's a messaging app
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.380]   We all know what that is and what I like about it is that there's there's some there's some genuinely good or at least
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:55.820]   From what I could tell from the from the keynote good innovation there. I was like oh yeah, I want to use that
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.340]   I want to try that
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.340]   There were there were things about it that that I really like so I welcome that and I mean
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.500]   I don't know Google does tend to be like alright
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.820]   Well, let's just you know build this new app instead of trying to improve you know
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.740]   This old one like in hangouts in this case
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.420]   But you know I think that might be just kind of part of the game with social apps
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.820]   You know you just kind of have to you know build a thing and see what kind of adoption it gets and then just start you know
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.220]   Start fresh at least from a branding perspective
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.300]   Here's the key that we all need to use a messaging app right if you're using a smartphone
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.420]   You have to use a messaging app and Google has made it possible in Android to use
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.980]   I'm using Google Messenger as my standard SMS app
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.720]   Which means I can I use it for SMS and I have some of those features in SMS, but then I can also use it as a
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:46.560]   Data-only messaging app with other people who use Facebook Messenger kind of like Apple's messages
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.420]   Isn't that kind of make it a little bit different because you have to choose one and if Google starts bundling this into Android and make it
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.260]   The default I hope they will make it the default messaging in up in Android doesn't that
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.580]   Give you this great starting point and then people's things like the instant replies from inbox
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.020]   Well are so useful in inbox
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.620]   It's crazy how much I use those and wouldn't you want that in the texting app?
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.180]   Go ahead Jeff no
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.860]   Because you're all in the same room
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.900]   What we're gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna call on you so Jeff Jarvis
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.260]   And then Matt you're next it takes away my usual obnoxious interrupting all well you can interrupt it
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.180]   We'll just hear you in the distance. I could fill a buster now
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:40.340]   The instant replies in inbox you're talking about and how that
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.620]   All you need is one wedge in an app like this to get people using it and then and then it can snowball
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.980]   Here's the thing I said this a few weeks ago
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.060]   On the show or I said it on dot NYC what I what I imagine is gonna happen is somebody's gonna say
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.100]   Did you say that or did was that cool was reply?
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:03.420]   Yeah, but they don't I you know isn't this your experience it learns and it gives it gives replies that are
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.860]   Unkindly like the ones you would be giving and they're you they even said this they're unique to everybody
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.220]   Yeah, it's a lot of points in my case. I
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.500]   Wonder why Jeff?
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.180]   Matt have you been using this? I mean are they are they soak testing this with Googlers or?
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.740]   They usually do a lot of testing with Googlers
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:28.060]   I've been trying to ramp down my dog food in a little bit to kind of get a regular person's experience. Oh, no
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.940]   You don't want a regular person's experience trust me. No, it's it's handy to sort of see okay
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.700]   What's you know like for example last night? I was
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:41.260]   Danny Sullivan's in town for Google I/O and so we were talking but we were DMing on Twitter
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.460]   but was what was interesting to me is I was navigating to that hotel and
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:52.260]   It was the first time in six months that I remember like whoa the Google voice recognition didn't exactly nail when I was
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.620]   Type you know saying a destination. So I think if you think about what Google's good at there's a lot of machine learning
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:04.660]   There's a lot of artificial intelligence. There's a lot of voice recognition stuff and and then Google needs to figure out how to encapsulate that
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.460]   Well, whether it's an agent a bot, you know an app
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.260]   That's a difficult problem, but I think it's heartening to me that Google is trying to figure out the right way to approach that
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:21.100]   And I do think that there's a lot of value to be added just like with the smart replies in inbox smart replies to chat smart, you know
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.740]   there's a lot of
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.780]   Just annoyance in the world that Google could really help with if we can find a way or if Google can find a way to
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.300]   Balance that all the constraints correctly. I also think that and this was at the very end of the keynote
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.980]   they threw this thing at the Android instant apps in and and
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.980]   The idea is you don't have to have an app installed if you call on your phone to do something
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.980]   It doesn't know how to do it will get
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.100]   the a little piece of the appropriate app and it'll
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.220]   Quickly know how to do it and I think that this ties this dovetails interestingly with aloe and I think it makes
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.420]   What what's it gonna start happening?
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:05.220]   I think it's about time is instead of a bunch of siloed apps on your smartphone then you have to know which app to run
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   You have to install the app first and blah blah blah
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:13.500]   Your what basically becomes your spots smartphone becomes more monolithic and I think aloe has the option as the
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.340]   Chance of becoming that kind of user interface
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.180]   Aloe plus the Google assistant aka. Okay Google that your phone
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:28.940]   Now is getting more and more like an assistant with multiple capabilities and the ability to learn more capabilities as you ask it to do
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.100]   We won't think about apps anymore
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.460]   We will just interact with our phone and I will just and that's where I think aloe is gonna be genius
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.700]   I'm gonna say I need a reservation for dinner for - Jeff
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:47.220]   Doing what it does these days which is strike blows for the open web
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:54.340]   And so I think that the instant apps pulls the pieces out of an app out to make them useful without you having to install them
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.060]   Which is good for both sides right?
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.980]   It's good for the open web because the web can now get to earlier search could get the things in apps now
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.700]   And you could interact with apps otherwise now you can get to the pieces of app without installing them
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.660]   But also if you like what you see when you're there you might install it as well and become a user
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.700]   So it does become customer acquisition for apps in the play world
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.620]   So it works to me very well both ways, but it really is I think an open web
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.740]   Initiative I don't know what a rails thinks or open platform because it's not just the web
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.620]   I mean it's if I say I want to be out into the web into the web. Yeah, the app into browser
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.460]   Well, yeah, yeah, it means to me that the phone is less monolithic. Yes
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:38.180]   What's Android only though, right? I mean this is as far as I understood that's not gonna work on on iOS
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.780]   I actually am actually aloe is available on iOS
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.740]   Well, I was available the Android instant apps it's not and that's gonna be a little problem for Apple
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.380]   You know what else is available on iOS is G board the new Google keyboard
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.500]   Which already introduced some of these features and I was actually a little bereft when I tried it on iOS
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   I said I want this on Android
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.660]   They're mo that's why they didn't make one for Android. They're moving these capabilities into Android in a very interesting way
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.460]   You're an iOS user, I guess
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.880]   Me yeah, yeah, I have an iPod touch just to like try out stuff that I
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:21.700]   enjoyed but I gotta tell you the instant apps announcement like that for me that was the big like boom my drop
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.940]   How is this happening?
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.060]   I mean like as an Android developer I was like wait, what how is this happening?
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.780]   What is they're downloading part of the app on the fly and displaying the color?
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   So cool so cool and does it mean they implied that you you would be your same app you'd have to modularize it more
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.020]   There must be some mechanism for saying well
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.540]   I need these resources if you want this part these are the parts of the app you could call on
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.300]   Yeah
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.420]   I mean, you know, honestly Android development has like been moving in that way like fragments and like the way that you structure your app is
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.300]   Are these kind of are is very modular and it has been for several iterations now?
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   So I can see I imagine that that modulus
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.860]   Modularization process which I'm not sure what the details are but I'm sure it's not that difficult to implement
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.980]   So yeah, I still I'm still just like how does that work like that?
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:22.060]   How fast like how fast can perform in a real-world situation if I want 4G or even 3G, you know, like how does that work?
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.140]   I really want to see it, but I was yeah, I was really
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.420]   Impressed and excited about that as an Android developer from as it you know as a you know
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:36.080]   It's just a firm point from from an acquisition point of view user acquisition point of view is do you feel like Aloe?
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   it is kind of
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.640]   the the on phone analog of Google home the new physical hub that they
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.620]   announced it feels like
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:54.620]   Really what Google is doing is putting Google everywhere and Google is there they've now coined the name is this new Matt calling it Google Assistant?
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.780]   Is that something new or is it is new?
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.700]   Okay, but they needed that because we didn't know what to call it. We have Siri we have Cortana. We have Alexa, but yeah, yeah
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.340]   Yeah, so so Google Assistant now and and the idea is let's put it everywhere. It's on your phone. It's in your house
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:16.460]   You talk to it it will respond. It seems like it will respond in a similar way no matter what platform you use I
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.560]   Think that's very compelling man. I I
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.140]   This is this is the science fiction dream that I had for a long time
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:34.380]   Well, and if you think about it a very good way to think about Google is Google cares about how people get to Google
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.380]   How do people typically get to a Google? Well
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.860]   Get to Google search that gets there via a browser
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.260]   Okay
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.960]   Well, we need to have a browser and in fact it's called Chrome because it tries to get all the Chrome out of the way
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.860]   You know and well, how else do people get to you know Google? Well, they'll use a mobile operating system. Oh, okay
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.860]   That's interesting. They'll use a laptop like a Chromebook. Okay. Well, that's interesting
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:24:01.260]   And so over and over again, you can see Google being very worried about people who can get in between users and Google and add
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:07.180]   Barriers or obstacles and so I do think it's a pretty smart way to think about it as if you can do voice recognition
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.060]   If you can do the machine learning if you can be a useful assistant
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.700]   The mechanism of exactly how that gets delivered whether it's a little hockey puck beside you or whether it's in your you know
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.380]   Your Google now or your Google assistant
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.620]   I think Google is pretty agnostic about that
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:26.940]   But they want people to be able to do that and thinking about how to get around those barriers so that users can do those searches with the
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.420]   minimal amount of friction is a pretty good way to think about what Google might or might not do well
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.940]   I'm speaking of which neither Alo no Duro require a Google account. They're both tied to your phone number
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.180]   Yeah, not to your Google account
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:45.500]   Because there's so many people around the world who don't have Google accounts or you know, that's just another element of friction
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.020]   And so I think you know
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.740]   Maybe you know the phone number of your friend and you don't know their email address or something like that making it as easy as possible
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.740]   That you can have those interactions without worrying about
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:01.700]   Join here. Oh off to whatever that kind of stuff just makes it a lot easier. Is it the end of Hangouts? I?
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.220]   Honestly, I think I saw on Twitter
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.460]   They need to clarify what's going on with Google voice and hangouts and all that sort of stuff
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.460]   And I think that's a fair knock
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.100]   Because you can try to have a monolithic communication app or you can say oh no
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.860]   It's actually better to break it into different ones like Facebook split out messenger
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.520]   You know and the right answer might evolve over time, but I do think Google needs to do a better job of saying okay
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.660]   Here's what happens with Google voice. Here's what happens with Google Hangouts because
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.540]   You know like you you like Google voice you've used it a lot in your past or Google Fi
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.100]   You know, I love Google Fi
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.020]   I'm gonna use it when I'm going abroad in a few weeks and that's very well supported
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:44.020]   But how exactly all those pieces interact? I think Google could do a better job of explaining what their future road map looks like
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.860]   What do you think Jason? Is it the end of Hangouts? I don't I don't know how they can exist at the same time
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:56.340]   How aloe and duo can exist side-by-side with Hangouts because yes aloe and duo bring their own expanded functionality
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.260]   But I feel like Hangouts
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.740]   I mean it was it was basically like the next iteration of Hangouts was kind of how I saw it and they did a great job with it
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.820]   I'm very excited to use it
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.260]   But I don't know like like I was saying earlier
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:11.180]   It's there's so much confusion already that when you have a messaging app and a smart messaging app
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.620]   You have a messaging app that has video chat and then you have a video chat app
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:21.580]   I don't know how they coexist without doing some sort of either elimination or convergence or I don't know
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.300]   How they treat that but it feels a little messy as far as that's concerned
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.780]   We need more clarification and they were quick to say that
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.420]   Aloe isn't available till summer and duo is not available to summer
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.340]   What do you like how you like this thing Jeff read the knock knock thing where when you call somebody?
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:41.140]   They see you before they answer right so it really struck me is that that's that's the end of all this integrate
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:47.060]   And Bell it's the end of the Bell it's the end of the ringtone and all that idea is that is it and it also means that you've now
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.100]   Gotta sell your call because nobody wants to talk on the phone right nobody likes anymore
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   So it's gonna be crazy
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.620]   Like
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:04.700]   Yeah
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:24.820]   I wonder if I wonder if we're gonna get an unusual number of well never mind. I won't I won't I won't go there sexual matters
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:31.020]   Yes, you know, you knew exactly where I was going. Oh, I know you want up. That's your sexual pause. Well, but yeah
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.380]   Oh, yeah, you know me so well now. You know my sexual pause, okay
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.620]   You know this pause. This is the one where we go to commercial pause
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.860]   No, but I I do think
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:48.340]   They're gonna have to be controls in there because otherwise I'm gonna get a disproportionate number of
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.780]   Knock knock jokes on my phone from strangers
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.420]   You know I'm saying oh, yeah, yeah
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.100]   Yeah, we need a safe word don't we

[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.020]   And I'm gonna have it ready in 40 minutes the house smells great

[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.280]   The box is refrigerated, but there's nothing frozen seafood is sourced
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:38.220]   Sustainably the beef is raised humanely the chickens are free range. It's stuff. You want to feed your family the pork is raised naturally
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:44.340]   The vegetables are all from local farms regenerative farming practices, so it's healthful stuff

[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.060]   So it's a great way to cook together
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:16.300]   Research shows I believe it or not blue apron families cook you know three times more often and the kids learn that it's fun to cook
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.740]   It's great to cook it's a message you want to send and it's less than ten dollars a meal

[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.140]   I think it's a better way to do messaging bots, but it's not the only new thing
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.440]   I think the Google home is very interesting too. This is
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.060]   basically a speaker to take on the Amazon echo and
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:52.580]   The fact that it works with Chromecast and Chromecast audio means it's the answer to my dreams
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.540]   Gina, what do you think?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.820]   Yeah, I'm excited about it
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:03.060]   You know, it's funny my Neil my co-founder loves the echo and would talk about how great the echo was and it was around the time
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:08.300]   That I got in my my Google watch Google Wear watch and I was like I mean, it's the much
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.100]   It's up to just sits in one place in your house. He's like no no
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:17.060]   I mean, I like I love to see the Google version of this and so now now we have it
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:23.180]   And it's cute. It's small when he walked out with it. I was like much cuter than the echo. Yeah. Yeah
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:31.540]   The fact that you can it becomes a multimedia center in your house that you could say play on the living room TV
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:37.760]   That's what I what the echo doesn't do that I really wanted it to do
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.280]   It eliminate you can make it do that with some extra hardware, but this this just kind of happens
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.980]   It's Chromecast audio support Chromecast video support Jason. How are you gonna run out and get one?
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.620]   We don't know what the price is we and we don't know when it'll be available sometime later this year is all they say yeah
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:34:00.080]   Later this year is all we have right now. Yeah, I mean I've been so on the fence of getting the echo
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.140]   Very recently because you just keep hearing about it
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.120]   So dang, you know happy with their experience with the echo so I've been on the fence
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.400]   But I wanted to wait and see if Google had their own coming out
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.740]   So obviously they do yes
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:17.800]   I'm on board one thing that we're not gonna get from what I understand right out of the gate is multi account
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.440]   Capability so for a shared device
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.260]   So it's gonna be on my Google account. Yeah, exactly
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   Let's me switch
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.600]   Eventually, but they say that so keep that in mind, but yes, I'm looking forward to it. I'm really want this
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   Oh, Jeff. We've just broken in Jeff's
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.580]   You know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.320]   I'm gonna want to use it on my apps account all along along and no no one comes out
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.820]   It'll only be the damned Gmail account
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.060]   And then I can't switch anything because because it knows me as this person not as that person and won't know anything about me
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.100]   And I'll google can't you fix this
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   Can't you fix this?
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:05.880]   I'm always going for my run while I listen
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.380]   And with Jeff, you know, you just press the button because you know
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:15.300]   It's a completely fair criticism about Google apps accounts not being able to do everything they go against
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.820]   And I'm like, oh no the next minute is not gonna
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.220]   I should start doing intervals whenever I hear that
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.900]   You wouldn't think it would be that rocket sciencey, but apparently it is
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.980]   These are consumer products too, really let's face it. They're not these are not
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.100]   Work and it's interesting to me because I have an Amazon Echo in my home
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.420]   You know, and I use it. I like to do, you know, what's the news and that sort of stuff?
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:45.780]   But what really was interesting to me is I was visiting my sister-in-law and this was like a year ago
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:52.660]   And her kids were asking the echo to like tell jokes and I was like, oh this this is interesting
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:58.540]   This is connected in a lot in a way that a lot of different consumer products really didn't you know catch on and
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.140]   So I'm glad that Google now has this offering
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.860]   We'll see how well it works. I'm hoping that the voice recognition everything works really really well
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.180]   I like the LEDs, you know, so yeah, it's like yeah, it's pretty cool
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:14.940]   So so the response for this one is hey Google versus okay Google
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.940]   She said hey Google on one of them I
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.680]   Think yeah, which is interesting. Yeah, I think they really struck me about about home is that it is not mobile
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:28.320]   Right everything is mobile everything's gonna be think of mobile mobile mobile mobile mobile mobile and this is the thing that is
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.420]   explicitly not mobile
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.180]   Which I kind of like and it makes you think about a different use case around it
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.620]   Well, that's what made the echo interesting because I think the reason the echo worked
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.580]   It wasn't as smart as Siri or Google or anything else
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.780]   But the reason it worked for a couple of reasons
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.940]   But the main reason is because you're talking to your house there is no device
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.020]   You just you're standing there stirring the stew and you say set timer for 20 minutes
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:54.060]   You talk to your house and it responds or you say I need new batteries and it says oh, yeah
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.400]   You ordered them before these ones. Yes, that is magical even though its capabilities are much more limited
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:08.220]   Also makes you buy one for every room. I have yeah when this is my sad face because I have five of these things and
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.700]   That I guess I'll still need them for my audible books, but I
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:21.100]   Got to say I watched that video for for the product and I was like I I aspire to this being my my family life in my home life
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:27.380]   Someday, it's just seem like just such a well-oiled machine. I was like, oh, I wish my morning look like this
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:34.300]   I hate those videos though cuz nothing can live up to that, you know
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:42.160]   They're just too good. They're just too good. Yeah in my house. We forgot the castoon for space day completely for
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.160]   Yeah, that was good
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.480]   The kid comes and he looked at this sad face and you forgot ah what's our next appointment?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:56.160]   It's space day at the Hermes school. Oh, yeah, my kid shows up and is like mom. I mean for God
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.400]   We show up at school without the costume
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.480]   The only thing I thought was interesting was at the very end where he says goodbye
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.720]   Because I think there was a piece by hunter walk where he's like Alexa is teaching my kids to be rude
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.520]   You know and he's basically like they don't say please they don't say thank you
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.000]   And he wanted that sort of you know stuff to be built in and so I first second
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.240]   I thought it was gonna say oh goodbye
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.120]   You know an Icedy and instead it's like oh we'll turn you into auto away mode and all that sort of thing
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.360]   It did you did have functionality the nest turned off and and all of these things so I
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.200]   Kind of like that it would be nice if these things would teach our kids to say please and thank you
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.720]   Yeah, wouldn't execute the command like like Alexa says what's the secret? What's the magic word?
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:51.320]   Okay, Matt make a note of that just pass it along your team. There should be a magic word mode
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.440]   I will write that down and in fact so Neil Stevenson
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.120]   Yeah, there was something like the diamond age
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.080]   It was like the young lady's primer or something and it basically was like an AI that would teach yeah
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.400]   This you know young girl over you know over until she became a young woman
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.080]   And I just man if you could get to that mode where you're just like you've got this kid
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   He loves tarmigans and birds and stuff and he wants to know about dinosaurs
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.480]   And it could kind of like slip in a little educational stuff in addition to the please and thank you
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.360]   I'm like that would be much better than just watching you know videos or or TV
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.720]   So maybe you remember the episode of Silicon Valley where they have the artificial intelligence nanny
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.600]   Scolding the child
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.200]   Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.160]   Man, I'm so excited about this idea of not having repeat stuff to my daughter 16 times
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.200]   Your mother told you
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.620]   That was terrible. Yeah, it was painful. It was painful
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.880]   But but but but you see how we are really moving in the direction of these
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.560]   artificial assistants well exactly and again because it knows how to respond as you that's we thought these
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:11.520]   Ages would go off and get things for us right but it but it learns to respond as me and says what I would say anyway
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   And so it now will soon say it for me
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:19.800]   And then no one's gonna know if they're dealing with me or by the way there is you know a new Facebook messenger
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.720]   But this is the use of my name that I approve of called Jarvis right?
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.880]   Right, it's actually pretty good. It's pretty neat. Yeah, you told her mind you right so so I'm by talking to Jarvis or Jarvis
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:37.840]   Right, you're not gonna know well Google has a huge advantage here because as we know Apple is very reluctant to collate information
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.120]   Or they say they are say they are about how you
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:48.440]   Use stuff Google you know has been always collecting that information and should be able to use that
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.600]   to make this stuff better and smarter and
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.640]   And you know it there's a kind of interesting because I think in some senses
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.880]   This encourages you it gives you a reason to give Google this stuff
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.560]   Yeah, and Leo I think the release struck me most this morning is that and I've talked about mass media being over and mass
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.360]   Treats you like all the same and I say to my people in media Google is a personal services company
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:23.320]   It knows you as an individual in media does not now what I saw today more than ever is that Google is a personal company
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.760]   It knows you as an individual. That's really powerful as long as the trust can stay up
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:34.320]   Which I have no problem with it. I welcome my new master all as well. It's good come in you and I are that way
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.600]   I mean, we don't mind we embrace this
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.640]   I think as long as you get value back as long as the user gets value back
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   They're gonna be fine with this and Google is demonstrating huge value for allowing this personal relationship to occur
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   I
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:55.400]   You know I the value is there already for me. This is it's so interesting because we've been looking at so many Google products like Google now
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.200]   And saying it's so it could be so useful and so great and all along
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.880]   This is Google has been has been building this kind of
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.680]   informational utility and and then there's this kind of
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:17.240]   Physicality is singularity if you will where it takes the stuff. It's been learning and now it's really hideously valuable really functional
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.920]   So now cards while they were interesting never really took off as a super valuable thing
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.380]   But but this could be our little rosy the riveter in our house
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:32.040]   Was either riveter well, it's like that little rosy the robot in the in the Jetsons, right?
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:38.300]   No the Jetsons rosy. Yeah, it's a little one of that but you put wheels on it and give it a duster feather duster
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:44.280]   It's running the robot help help the children in the house cheat on their homework
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:50.000]   Interesting wasn't it yeah, basically said yeah, that's totally helping with your homework
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.440]   Parents to know it's okay
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.200]   Yeah, she whispered it she whispered it. She knew she knew she wasn't supposed to do that
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.640]   So to cook I think it would I think it would do that I
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.720]   Think you do that. Why wouldn't it? Yeah?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:13.700]   Suddenly the story was somewhere I think in Asia about people who were taking a class or a test and they had
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:20.500]   Cameras in their glasses, which then sent the you know the the questions off to somebody else who then figured out the answer and
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:27.260]   sent the answer to the people smart watches and so they have the watch apps that's like the answer is see kind of thing and
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.860]   The future's gonna get a little weird there, you know
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.820]   How do you do a standardized test if you're you know if you well my bot will write the code for me here?
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.420]   You know kind of stuff it could be a little strange. We'll see what happens
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.860]   Well, I have to I have to admit I just started my new job here post like three weeks ago
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:47.140]   And I'm director of engineering and there's all these technologies here that I just don't have a lot of experience with so
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.020]   I've been in these meetings where they'll be like, oh, yeah
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.660]   We're using this stack and this this you know mean suck and known and Django and then and I'm like, uh-huh
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.860]   Yeah, no, uh-huh then I go back to my desk
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.060]   And what do you do you immediately you Google it right?
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.860]   I'm sure that my Google search like search activity has spiked very high the last three weeks
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.020]   I've been reading and looking stuff up. There's a concert
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.220]   My rosy by the way there's a concept in programming called cut and paste programmers
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.340]   And there's a kind of programmers a cut and paste programmer because they go to stack exchange
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.140]   They cut and paste the code and they and they move on and you know it works
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.660]   You could do that's how I do it. I don't know how to do anything
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.780]   I just cut and paste you get yourself out of a jam and sometimes Google has the answer in like within the results and
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.460]   Literally you don't even have to go to you don't even go to stack exchange
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.620]   Just cut and paste from the knowledge graph
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.380]   By the way big growth in the knowledge graph
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:44.900]   And and this is where you really starting to see the value of that then I do believe there's a critical mass
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.820]   Where it just turns over everybody says fine. This is too good
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:55.380]   We're gonna all use it and then everybody pours more information in there and gets smarter and smarter and the end of the media brand
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.540]   Interesting isn't it because
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:04.900]   You want the knowledge you don't want care about the brand thing about siloing app application silos it all goes away
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.820]   It all this becomes and for Google
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:14.620]   That's a good thing because this becomes your entry point into the entire world of information all the real world's information at your fingertips
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.220]   That's the end game and just as you have to write applications
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:24.300]   Modularly so in the future should you write news articles and books modularly so that you can go in and grab the piece of it
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.220]   Which it doesn't necessarily fit our business model
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.600]   But it fits the use case of somebody wanting to get just what they want right?
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:37.460]   Were you pleased were you surprised to see Android where I did not think we would see anything about Android where?
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:43.020]   That's not the Gina you still wear your and I love Android where used to wear your Android no
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:50.380]   There you go. There's a Moto 360 all the presenters. I should point out. We're wearing Moto 360 is every one of them
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.020]   so the one thing that was kind of nice about Android where is
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:05.340]   They had the idea of watch faces where you can pull in data from any data source and automatically fold that into
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.260]   I love that and I use a Garmin watch for running and it's kind of interesting because they now have custom watch faces
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.540]   But a lot of them are really ugly and you're stuck with whatever that person designed that watch face for so the idea of like
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.220]   Pulling in your step counts the day or something
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:23.140]   Automatically and like not having to be a you know a programmer do it that that was kind of interesting
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.460]   I thought that was a smart way to add a little bit of value to the idea of Android where Android where 2.0
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.980]   So you'll be able to have custom
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.740]   Complications as Apple calls them. I'll just call them widgets
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:40.660]   And they could pull from any app any developer could put a complication on your watch face at Android where 2.0 Apple calls them
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.820]   Complications yeah, that's a horala. Okay. Get ready for that
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.860]   You know when you you enter the Apple world you enter a whole new world the world of horology. That's what horologists
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.340]   Call them watchmakers call them
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:59.080]   Complications. Oh, I see okay. You Google people wouldn't know about that, but I think which widgets is fine
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.580]   It is just seems like it would a thing to develop like something a developer needs to do like
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.620]   Complications. Yeah. Oh, that's just what I want. That's what they do all the time. Yeah
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:17.740]   So they didn't they did mention it when the things they did not mention is a Chrome OS and Chromebook
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:26.060]   However Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted will have lots more to say about that at 11 tomorrow. So there is gonna be
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:30.980]   It's not unfortunately a keynote and it's not gonna be streamed live, but there will be more information
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.580]   So Matt you could tell us more about that, right?
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:40.300]   Well, I'm sure I'll maybe end up tweeting out, you know, I've got my Chromebook pixel - I still I love my Chromebook
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:47.580]   So I do to more and more Jeff Jarvis is a full-time Chromebook user. I plan to go and hug Hiroshi like I'm where tomorrow
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:53.740]   Yeah, well, but isn't Hiroshi the Android guy. So why is he tweeting about Chromebooks? What is that all about?
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:59.660]   And our intrepid producers found an interesting listing in
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.740]   The Google I/O schedule. Let me see if I can find it
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:12.320]   That in that says as we announced this is for tomorrow. It's at 4 p.m. Tomorrow as we announced earlier today
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.620]   Android developers can now put their apps in Chrome OS
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.620]   So there's a little hint
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:29.980]   The rumors fear has been pointing to the possibility of the play store opening up to include Chrome
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:36.340]   Chrome web apps number one and then number two some sort of cross compatibility of Android apps
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:41.460]   That's why they're expanding Android app compatibility inside Chrome OS. So we'll see
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.660]   Sounds like maybe they meant to do some sort of announcement today and they had to push it
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.940]   There was a there was a rumor floating around. I was told that
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:56.100]   That they had planned something today and they ran out of time or they didn't they had to cut some things
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:01.300]   Well, you know a PR person told me that they did intend to say something about Chrome
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.300]   This whatever they're gonna say at 11 o'clock tomorrow
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.380]   Was gonna be part of the of the keynote today, but they ran out of time
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.980]   literally, yeah
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.980]   Two days
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.140]   Our keynotes to cover everything we got sick. Yeah, cuz I looked I thought oh great
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.660]   There's gonna be another keynote everybody got ready tomorrow 11 a.m. And no
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.580]   So they ran out of time
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:26.700]   They just you know what this Google has its fingers and a lot of pies and by the way, we also had to mention
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.440]   This is not an alphabet keynote. So there's nothing about
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.740]   Autonomous vehicles because that's not a Google product. There's nothing about Nest
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:39.940]   There was a little mention of Nest, but I would expect that actually and that the home product
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.740]   Will be will it be in the Nest division? That's actually kind of interesting
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:50.520]   It's in the hard the new hardware division that is nest part of their hardware division
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.180]   Rick Osterlows coming back from motor memory was a guy motor
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.960]   Hardware is a separate except you from nest is it Google?
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.540]   I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it is. Yeah
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.340]   Alphabet and Google hardware is Google, but I'm not positive that I mean
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.300]   You can close your ears map, but that breeding the tea leaves
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:16.460]   Shows once again that I think the nest divisions and Tony Fidell's division a little bit on the outs
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:24.140]   At this point if they didn't get Google home Google got that but it is a search a search appliance. So maybe that makes sense I
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.780]   Would love to see
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:32.180]   What I want I love Chrome OS. I want to see Chrome OS continue yes
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.820]   Yes
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:42.420]   The interesting thing to me was now you've got these four hundred ninety nine dollar Chromebooks, but you talked about all the mid-range
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:48.580]   one the higher mid-range one and you can get them up to a thousand bucks by the time you max out all the ram and everything and
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:53.700]   Well, I hear that and on one hand that's great and on the other hand. I'm like I love my pixel
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.980]   I gotta have my pixel keep coming out with you know, we're in pixel three. Yeah 12 months 18 months
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.100]   I don't you know, but I just that is such a nice machine. How old is the pixel - I
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.340]   Think it came out last summer
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.980]   Was it at Google I/O last summer? So it's exactly a year old
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:12.980]   Yeah, I didn't say a word today. So this is this is concerning me greatly because I am addicted to it
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.100]   HVG is not gonna be the same
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.580]   Well, and to be fair. I think the the HP Chromebook will be really really good
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:27.660]   It's just I love the cleanness of the colors, you know, you know the lines and so maybe I should get over myself and go for that
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.300]   Yeah, but there's things they could do, you know, they could put you know
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.900]   Thunderbolt 3 on the USB-C they could put newer chips in there
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:40.620]   They could put I'd like to see more storage believe it or not because I'm actually running crouton and Linux on there
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.620]   I could use a little bit more storage
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:49.260]   It's a very powerful device we have in the studio with us four educators for teachers who are all about
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.100]   Chromebooks you they all use Chromebooks they're from Sacramento area
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:01.220]   And they came for the Google keynote and they've stayed for a twig but they're there they're they're sold on Google for education
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.540]   We heard nothing about Google for education. So I
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.660]   Well, I the keynote was still two hours
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   I know
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.980]   There's a finite amount of stuff you can fit in there and the whole rest of the three days is you know
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.580]   Plenty of time to tell people about the latest with Google for education and Chromebooks and Chrome OS
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.740]   I don't think that it's you know
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:25.740]   Oh, should we worry about Chrome OS because you know that that is a real winner in the education market and with you know
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.340]   People who don't want to do a lot of management maintenance configuration
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.860]   So, you know, I'm not worried about that at all. I just I just want my pixel
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.300]   I know that I am I and I love it but I love it
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.460]   I would I wouldn't take the lack of a mention of some of something in this keynote as like oh
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:45.380]   It's on death snell. There's there's a there's a lot of other stuff going on during the IO does putting Android apps
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.620]   There's some challenges to putting Android apps just putting them on
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.260]   Chrome OS
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.860]   I mean, there's the gene others the developer issue
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.620]   But there's also the issue of from users point of use is a touch we don't have touch what it
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.600]   Yeah, I'm still still unclear how that's gonna happen
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:08.500]   Yeah, interested to hear more about that. What about you Jason how do you think?
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.500]   Have you thought a little bit about what that would look like to put Android on that Chrome?
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.580]   Well, I mean we saw a little bit of this last year, right?
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.900]   They they rolled this out
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.820]   I think to a limited number of Android apps there were a certain small group of partners that they were they were doing this with and I
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.700]   Think you know is very much kind of like the windowed experience of an Android app beyond that
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.140]   I don't know personally
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:37.820]   I think it gets a little confusing if you have you know an app for one thing that's Android running in Chrome OS versus the web
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:43.840]   Hey, you know the web app and a web page and why you choose one over the other whether an Android app is
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.020]   Ideal for let's say the laptop kind of environment, you know
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:53.180]   And what form factor that's being brought in on is it the tablet version or is it the phone version or whatever?
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.100]   So I think there's a little bit of questions in there
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.340]   But if you've got access to all these things that we don't mind you
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.220]   We don't necessarily know if this is their announcement from tomorrow
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:06.540]   But if you've got access to that that kind of you know however many what is it a million?
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:11.540]   Plus apps from Android inside Chrome OS. I mean certainly wouldn't hurt
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.940]   It certainly feels fills a lot of gaps and it's a nice nice addition
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.660]   I really want to kind of see how it how it responds
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.820]   You know how to do it the same way you do it with Android Studio as an em
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.300]   You know it has an emulator window with it looks like a pixel
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   I mean a
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:34.580]   Nexus device as just you know on the screen is a window and you could do your Android apps and if you had that be basic but
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.020]   Yeah
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:43.380]   I haven't used the new the new Android studio and it's supposed to be way faster, but man those emulators are slow
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.540]   Are they slow? Yes, and again, I know it's supposed to get faster
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.700]   I was very excited about all the Android studio particularly speed
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:56.380]   Announcements and I need to get into the into the I think it's the beta channel and get the new one
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.820]   But yeah, no those emulators are generally really slow
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:06.900]   They even said during the Android studio talk that it was even faster than if you were running it on your phone
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.660]   So would that be a change from what you've been experiencing?
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.220]   Experiencing in Android Studio today. Oh
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.920]   Heck yeah, I mean the common knowledge amongst Android developers
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:23.140]   You hook up a physical device to your to your computer and you run you just skip the emulator
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.740]   entire
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:31.600]   Just get the emulator you attach an Android device and you test and run on that even that you know takes some time look
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:36.020]   It's you know, it's a process. It's a process and so I'm very excited
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.540]   I mean, you know this stuff just takes time so I'm very excited to see the speed improvements
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.140]   And I'm especially excited if the emulator has become you know useful that would be good too
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.220]   They're fast enough to be useful. That would be great. So I want to see that. I want to see that in person
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.860]   Well, we'll find out tomorrow. What's gonna happen with Android on Chrome OS and what's gonna happen with the Chromebooks in general
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.820]   I thought because there are all these nice mid-range Chromebooks do out any moment now
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:04.660]   I thought there would be a big announcement that that would coincide with the release of the HP in the Dell and the Acer and
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:10.940]   Or at least a free one under every chair. I thought that too. What did you get for free? You got a do rag and some sunglasses
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:16.180]   Nothing which I think we've talked about this the past and we know no nothing promised at the session
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:21.940]   Nothing no email afterwards saying oh and you have a you know a key to a self-driving car waiting you
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:27.900]   And I think that's fine. I think it's they had more developers here this year because they had the bigger venue
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.900]   This is for developers. That's the business benefit to Google
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.580]   It's the benefit all around and yeah, there were probably some disappointed geeks
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:38.380]   But but more important candy is a fast emulator, right?
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.580]   You know what they gave you Jeff you specifically ways on Android Auto
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.260]   Yeah, that's that yep
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.740]   Now if I can only get a car
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:55.820]   He's buying a car that's an accessory for his Android auto. I just passed it's true
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:02.940]   I just passed 200,000 miles on my beast because I can't find the right car. I need four-wheel drive
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:07.140]   I want a small little kind of minor SUV thing. I want Android Auto
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.580]   I think a Honda CRX let's get him a Honda CRX
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.140]   Honda has Android Auto
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.980]   Matt do you have Android Auto in your car? I don't and I am like Jeff. I'm kind of holding off
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.020]   I'm like, okay. I need one more car like my car is 12 years old ready to go
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:26.500]   I'm like if I have one more car then I can maybe make it through to self-driving cars after that
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:32.740]   So what's the one more car to get before I think this is the last petrol car either guy if you guys is gonna buy right?
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.820]   Well, and I'm sorry, but like you know besides Volkswagen
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.180]   It sounds like there's a lot of other car manufacturers that are suddenly like yeah
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:46.260]   We cheated on a missions test too, and so yeah an electric car quicker, you know, that's great for everybody
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:52.260]   So I you know, I'm I'm kind of waiting for the the Android Auto and and see what sort of stuff they've got available
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.220]   I think that'll be a lot of fun. I already bought my last gas car
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:03.140]   I'm not that's the end of it. You got your Tesla company feels good. Yeah, you know who else got has a Tesla X?
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.540]   Model X Bill Gates
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:10.700]   He posted a video of him interviewing Neil Stevenson about seven eaves
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.220]   Bill Gates did a book review of
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:20.740]   Neil Stevenson's latest seven eaves, which is hysterical and it's very Bill Gatesy and
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.900]   And he and then he posted it a video of him
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:30.020]   driving in cars basically stealing the Seinfeld idea
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.060]   But he did it but okay he did it one better because he does it in 360 degrees
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.640]   So there's the most awkward moment ever
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:43.980]   Let me see if I can play this because it's just the most awkward moment ever is when they're dancing that was pretty awkward
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.140]   Here's here's Bill Gates meeting Neil Stevenson Bill sitting on a bench
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:57.220]   Waiting to meet Bill ready to meet Neil. Can you get the audio? You're not hearing my audio. Oh
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:03.060]   It's the most awkward moment ever but a little later on they get in Bill's car and
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.620]   Fiction is so it's a model X that I I
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:11.020]   Know a few times you're I say no no I gotta preach
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:18.340]   Fiction stuff and friends mentioned that this be all I could say he's no Jerry sign
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:26.060]   Look as they're going by how do I zoom in on this? There's some people larping oh
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.940]   in the background
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:38.860]   What he'll Stevenson is into swordcraft stuff. Oh that was for Neil
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:46.100]   I thought by the way 70s is an awesome hard sci-fi book power. I just shipped a couple nights ago a
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:51.980]   Is this the strangest experience you've ever had that's this apparently on the roof
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:59.380]   Okay, now that you can hear me. I gotta go back to the the introduction
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.780]   of with the
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.780]   Bill Gates sitting on a bench
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:09.060]   Yeah, if you outfit your Tesla with some cameras then I could do this too
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.060]   Write that sucker off
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:16.980]   Good to see you. How's it going? Hey, I loved your book. This is fantastic
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:23.220]   Like this is like a bad Scientology video. Are you clear?
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:33.540]   Anyway, we're gonna take a break great panel you guys are in the Google Plex well some of you are anyway
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:40.420]   Gina Trepeney's not she's in New York City joining us from her brand new job is there some way we can

[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.780]   Is the page that served for the Google CDN? I
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:53.140]   Don't believe so. I think it's her from our side
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.700]   On this project really late a couple days ago. I got some code pushed in there, but
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.900]   Wow
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   What's it written in?
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.540]   It is a well
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:10.260]   There's a few layers to it the front end is a Django app and it uses actually the readability API to do some of the nice
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.740]   Are you back using Python?
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.420]   Yes, how nice that's awesome good for you
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:23.220]   And this is just a freebie like to introduce people to post light is that the idea or are you gonna charge for it at some point?
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:28.980]   Or you know, we have a lot of our clients are dealing with issues that publishers have publishing is big here in New York and Paul's a
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.200]   Lot of connections of the publishing community and we found that you know, this is just what you know
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.900]   Amplifying your pages was just a problem people were you know
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:42.500]   Small publishers didn't didn't have developers to get the work done and bigger publishers were taking time out of their schedule
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.060]   I was like, you know, this is this is a really pretty simple problem to solve. Let's just you know
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.900]   Yeah, let's provide a tool that can save you some dev time
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:55.180]   Particularly for smaller publishing clients, so and yeah, it's free for anybody use

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.540]   And we hope to extend it to I don't know if I'm supposed to say this I'm gonna say it anyway
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.540]   We
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   To support other formats
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:22.140]   In the future depending on on you know how people take up what we did we took on AMP first because it was the easiest
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.380]   Emo straightforward thing that we could we could do
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:32.340]   What other formats could those be like instant art instant articles? Yeah, like Facebook and start of those are apples
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.740]   Yeah
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.340]   Cool Wow Gina, that's great really is right nice to have you also

[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.060]   Alright, they did not tell us the name of nutroll
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:11.140]   Android
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.640]   And they did talk a lot about Android and or she lockheimer came on the stage
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.780]   But they said we're gonna let you name it come on Matt. What happened? They couldn't get the rice to Nutella
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.980]   Well, my favorite conspiracy theory is that
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.360]   Sundar Pachai visited India and someone was like, why don't you name it after this, you know
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.780]   Dish that starts with an end and he's like well. This was like a year ago
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.980]   He's like maybe we'll open it up to an online poll
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.900]   Maybe everyone in India will vote for it the next day or something like that
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.700]   And and so you know who knows but I think at the very bottom in the fine print
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.340]   It says we reserve the right to pick whatever we want
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.820]   This is for entertainment purposes only it won't be judged
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:56.020]   And I think they mean you won't get feedback when you say it ought to be called Nutella or not rule or whatever
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:02.620]   Specifically said it will not be maybe name face name a nickname face. They brought that right up smart
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.100]   Nope the
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.100]   Deadline is 11 59 p.m. Pacific time June 8th
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:16.500]   So I presume that by you know the next couple of weeks will learn you go to Android comm slash n and
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:22.020]   You name Android and I love I guess this is the Indian dish nay up nay up home
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.300]   Napalm
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   Yeah
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:31.700]   Android napalm really I don't know if they name palm is really the name we should get
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:41.020]   Here's noodles and nectarines nutmeg. Oh, I like this one. It had a post-it note. It's Narshemelow
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:48.580]   Post the post-it note fell off. We only see they took marshmallow crossed off the M and put the N on there
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.580]   And then posted no fell off
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:55.460]   Navy bean I that's not a dessert nuts and not shows
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.260]   If only not shows were dessert
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:06.940]   Not sure what they're saying is it doesn't have to be a dessert anymore nut shows anymore. What about nut shows
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.340]   Nuts and not shows together two great treats
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:19.380]   Together at last and then there's a video about of the naming. I wish it were like this
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.540]   This is straight out of Silicon Valley, right?
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.740]   John Smith. I'm CEO of PNI professional naming
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:34.820]   Big the latest version of Android needs a name they want people everywhere to share their ideas
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:41.140]   But I think it's a job for PNI they had Kit Kat a while ago jelly bean lollipop marshmallow
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:46.660]   I was thinking maybe since we had marshmallow last time maybe now we were gonna have Narshemelow
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:54.660]   I don't hate it. Maybe like toasted Narshemelow if you show me you you want to make sure his name is chum is inspired
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.900]   People on the streets. They wouldn't understand a lot of what we're doing. There's a lot of mathematics and
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.100]   Matrix in it, but it's it's half science and half art. It's but it's math and art
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.820]   It's like a baby when you give birth to a baby. It's science, but it's a baby and that is a soul
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.540]   And then you have to name it. Not show. That's
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.820]   It's a nut show
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:20.980]   Everything is changing constantly. It's a global world. If you don't do it right away
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.340]   It's pretty good on a t-shirt nashi pear
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.540]   Naval orange
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:32.900]   Direct distinct. You know exactly what it is. I feel really close to Narshemelow. I love
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:38.900]   Because it's got a length to it. They say if a shark stops swimming, it's it's dying
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.900]   I don't know if it's dying if it stops swimming or if you're not out there
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.940]   Like a shark naming things
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:50.660]   I'm not sure if that's okay
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:01.940]   We don't need these guys reads the text. We just need you. What would you name hashtag andra and
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:07.300]   I think that's actually it's a lot of fun. It's not gonna get bogey mcboe face. It's gonna get uh, something
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.260]   You know, uh, land or associates. Yeah, that's what they do, right?
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:15.620]   That's what they do. Yeah, they I think they created verizon. They call it branding
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.220]   Or nanding
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.340]   I did see a couple of sharp worded tweets about how it was a little bit
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:36.180]   Maybe of a bad idea to ask people to come up with why they don't have to tell anybody what they heard. Is there a prize?
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.780]   Well
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:42.580]   You don't want to ask for an explicit n-word. Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. But nobody
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.940]   Well, there's nowhere. No one's seeing seeing it, right?
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.980]   Someone said clearly a white person came up with this although if it was so dark, then that's not true
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.180]   Do we live in a world now where we have to you know kind of not have fun because of trolls? No
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.100]   Let's you know if somebody's gonna do that. They're gonna do it, but it's not gonna be public, right?
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.020]   Are we seeing them? I don't think we're seeing them. No, we're not saying I don't believe we are
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.180]   Less than less. You take a screenshot of the submission as you do it. It's
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.300]   Which I saw a lot of that as some people are doing. I know
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:19.700]   You know, that's sad. This is why we can't have nice things. That's terrible or nice contests naming contests
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:27.220]   Oh, well, anyway, uh, go in the direction of internet memes and go android nyan cat nyan cat
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.980]   I like yours Jason nom nom nom
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:38.340]   Yeah, that goes to the core of what makes a dessert a dessert. Yeah
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:45.700]   What do you it's a meta. Yes, it's a meta. It's a meta. Yeah, we probably won't have a brand name matti sink or do you think?
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.300]   I mean, I don't know what how how to kick that happen. I think it would be cool
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:54.500]   I think it would be cool to have a brand name like maybe you know, if not in go for oh or nerds
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.740]   How about the nerds? That's a brand name?
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:04.020]   I think my gelegon was like we should name it after the kind of people who come up with an android nerd android nerds would be just an awesome
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.180]   Uh
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.180]   Nougat. I like new get
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:15.700]   Well, they have have a hashtag name android in so yeah, noopsie nectar. I feel like uh, there's options
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.180]   I thought newtella was it was a dead lock to be honest with you, but I think it's not
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.820]   No, so I think it was not a lock the minute it was used as a joke early on
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:31.300]   I can't remember who it was but uh, I think the posting was we're not telling you what it is. Right. Yeah, no hooroshy luck. I'm
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.060]   Yeah, it was hooroshy. That's right. We're not
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:38.580]   I think the second I came out as the update that probably removed it from the running because they never tell you in advance
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:45.220]   You never know in advance. Are you excited about what you see with the new features of android and and we've seen a lot of it that beta
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.620]   Official beta came out today. In fact, uh, it was pushed to the pixel c today
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.740]   And I think the nine x is six p if you've registered it you should get it
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.220]   Have you been running the old one on your pixel c
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.900]   Uh the old and yeah, and we got the update
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:04.420]   Oh, yeah, the only negative is there are a few apps like every time I launch instagram
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.340]   It says you need a library update, but but it ran
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:14.820]   So I haven't are there any have you seen any serious crashes Jason? No, it's just weird stuff not happening
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.020]   It's a little janky. It's a little janky a little bit. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know and for all intents and purposes
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.700]   It's been alpha. This is their first to know their quotes actual beta
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.180]   Version of it. So this is the first one that I feel comfortable flashing onto my nexus six p
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:33.060]   Which I plan on doing tonight and kind of living with it a little bit more than I have with it prior
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:36.100]   Because it's just been all of a you don't have to flash it. It's an over the air update
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:41.300]   All you have to do is go to the beta site and and roll your device and you will get an ota update
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:50.340]   So you got it. There is he's got it. Yep. Yeah. That's an incredible nod to enthusiasts. I like that a lot
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.980]   You can get it over the air
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:59.380]   I yeah the one okay. So what's your favorite feature? My favorite feature is simply double tapping the recent button to go to the last
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.620]   Yeah, I love that's awesome
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.940]   That's awesome
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.980]   So okay, so I I was listening to the keynote and uh
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.220]   Over and over again. They kept saying we're gonna fold in this feature of chrome os
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:16.180]   And each time I was like, you know, direct boot and verified boot and all these security things
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.900]   I was like automatic updates. Seriously cool
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.740]   Yeah, so so like you know
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.100]   Android doesn't really have that much of a malware problem. There's a lot of security companies
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.340]   They're like look we found a malware thing in the play store
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:31.780]   But you know usually if you disallow third-party, you know apps then you're usually okay
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.500]   But I love the idea that they're like, you know
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.260]   If you take the best of chrome which in a lot of cases is this security and all that kind of stuff and and the um
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.940]   Oh my gosh, you don't have to wait for 45 applications to
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.500]   Oh, that's huge. I'm so sick of that
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.260]   Tell me about it
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.980]   Updating and updating updating update forever
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:55.780]   Now they're gonna be able to do this chrome book style
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.260]   Uh background update and reboot to update on anything but nexus phones
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.340]   That's a question because don't they have to get
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.700]   Samsung and lg or whoever to update their skin
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:10.260]   Get the radios updated from the third parties and all that stuff
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:17.620]   I could see them doing a chrome book style update on nexus devices, but I don't see it happening on a non-nexus devices or maybe
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.540]   It'll be a compelling reason to buy a nexus device frankly
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:27.940]   It does seem like google is always doing a better job of pressing people to stay up to date with security updates and those sorts of things
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:34.100]   So so maybe some of that comes into play with the new, you know generation of the operating system, but it is an open question
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   I'll be curious. Yeah
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.180]   But that's but the way they do it on chrome book is so great. It's too bad. You have to do a reboot
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.700]   But nevertheless, it's transparent. It happens in the background. You get a little notification
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.820]   You know, you reboot and it's all updated and yes
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.460]   now
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.820]   And by the way, 46 apps. What are you talking about? I got 245
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.620]   Now updating app 223 out of 245
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:04.980]   I just do it overnight
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:12.340]   Yeah, my my I guess it's the galaxy of seven will you can say update check for updates every night and update in the middle of the night
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.340]   Please my nightmare is that it's going to happen to me like what I'm waiting in line to get my boarding pass
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:22.820]   Yeah, something and you're just absolutely screwed. I don't think that I think that's probably half the point of the reboot
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.900]   I'm sure part of it is that you need to
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:30.660]   What so what they said which I thought was really cool is that there'll be each phone will maintain two images the current image
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:36.340]   And then an updated image so it's so it's transparent you just reboot and it says oh good
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.660]   We got the new image boot to that instead
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:44.900]   I'm hoping it keeps the old image around for a little bit so that you can always you can revert which would be even more coolness
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:50.340]   That would be nice. Yeah, if you're any problems, that's awfully geeky who would even know what a revert means
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:55.860]   Well, you'd have a button said, you know, are you having you know, if you're having trouble, uh, you can revert to your previous version
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.940]   Android safe mode. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.740]   I did the safe mode actually for the longest. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but I'm thinking like the windows. Yeah
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.900]   Yeah
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.620]   When you release safe in life is what that happens to you. Yeah
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.180]   Yeah
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:18.340]   Yeah, I mean android android at google.io is definitely different this year for the obvious reason that usually in years past
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.980]   We hear about these things and the new release
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:25.940]   First at iow and and we've been doing this kind of developer preview now for a couple of months
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:31.940]   So it was hard to do an announcement that really included much that was very new beyond what we already knew
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.540]   But I mean I think the biggest thing there that we haven't talked about is vr
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.500]   And how vr is intertwined into android
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:43.300]   Coming up on android and that was kind of their big announcement. I think as far as android is concerned
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:49.860]   Daydream they call it which is interesting because that's the name of the screen safer on android, but I know right they already own it
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:57.620]   So no big deal. This is not what rumor mill had said which was a stan roit standalone android vr
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:03.060]   Um, this is actually much more like galaxy gear vr where you have you still need a phone, right?
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:09.700]   And you have a uh two devices the reference is a visor plus a remote control looking
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.780]   Click really nice for road. It did look good. I like that reference design
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:18.980]   Of course, that's just a reference design which implies that google is not going to manufacture this they're going to let third party
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   like nexus. Yeah
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.020]   As a reference, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.900]   What do you think vr?
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.140]   I mean, let's I'll ask you Jason how because you're the all about android guy. What do you think?
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.780]   Well, I mean I was really curious
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:39.700]   We had heard a lot leading up to it that there was the possibility of vr being built into the operating system
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:43.140]   And in my mind I was trying to kind of figure out like what does that look like?
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:47.540]   What what does it look like when you've got a mobile os that works in different form factors
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.820]   But now you're going to into a completely different world almost quite literally and I like what I see
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.260]   I mean it definitely seems like yes, it's an it's android
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:02.340]   For vr, but it's really you know, it's it's not android in the sense that it does every single thing that android does
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:06.100]   It's very tailored for the specific things, you know the apps the game
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.500]   This looks a little bit like android tv frankly
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.340]   The interface except it's three three dimensional right?
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:16.020]   Uh, i'm excited to play around with it and and see you know
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.460]   I don't know what kind of traction it can get it
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:23.220]   I think it's kind of a kind of an interesting thing to think about building
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:28.660]   Something like this into the core operating system. Yeah, I don't I didn't read it that way
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.940]   I mean
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.380]   Would it surface on a phone? Would you somehow see some sort of vr?
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:41.620]   Or is it just that the operating system has this capability? I don't yeah, no, no, no, it's it's definitely more of that but um
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.820]   I know i'm interested to see i also think that
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.820]   I like the way they're going about the kind of reference design
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   Approach they're allowing you they're basically giving this reference design to
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:59.060]   Everyone have it to have access to and create compatible, you know daydream ready as they say
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.460]   uh hardware so that um
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:06.580]   You know the phones can kind of work with this right out of the gate. I'm excited to play around with all the stuff
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.460]   I saw today this one seemed like the most me too
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:14.340]   We don't really have anything original here. This is just gear vr basically
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.900]   Mm-hmm
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.860]   Anybody want to argue with me really enjoyed
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.740]   That's speaking listen about
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:31.700]   Well, no, I was just gonna say I do think that there's got to be some plumbing to get the latency to work really well because historically people have complained about
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.860]   You know like audio apps on iOS versus android and I know they don't want to work to try to
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:39.460]   Vulcan level library that right yeah make that more professional
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:45.860]   Uh, so I you know the fact that there's more in the substrate of android that now makes things
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:51.460]   You know that you can count on okay. You'll have this minimum frame rate or this this minimum latency sort of thing
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:56.340]   I think that is good because it gets everybody on the same page. So that should help a little bit
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:05.060]   Um, yeah, I mean the way sam's on handled that is by saying you have to have a sam's on phone a galaxy s6 or s7 or a galaxy no
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.980]   I mean vr is happening and it's it's it's everywhere
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:14.420]   This is not that this is more like cardboard or a galaxy gear vr than it is like an oculus rifter of five
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.860]   but
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.180]   It just feels like a meat it feels like yeah, we got that too
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.620]   But wait, well wait after aloe home
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.580]   Yeah, it was all about that
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   You think that day dream was the biggest
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.620]   Aloe had some really cool neat new features same with google home
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.860]   This doesn't have any this is not anything new in my opinion
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:39.060]   It just it looks exactly like every other lobby and every other vr
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.700]   I think it's no I think it's the back end of the i think it's the developers conference
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.500]   And what they're trying to do is get people to develop to vr to vr
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:50.660]   And they tried to say we're improving the functionality to that end. I don't think it was a consumer facing right
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.020]   We're gonna build in libraries so you can do a better job with vr
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.060]   Oh
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.060]   There so one thing that's interesting to me is
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:03.220]   There's a lot of people who have gone from example from google for work or google apps that area over to google vr
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:09.780]   And and the cloud enterprise area of google where they're trying to do these really great things is you know is a pretty interesting area
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:12.980]   So to have these people go from there to google vr
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.540]   Just as an outsider that would make me think okay
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:19.940]   What do they know or what what's interesting to them as opposed to a me too kind of product
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.060]   Now I think
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.060]   You know it still remains to be seen when experiences start to show up and hardware starts to show up
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.180]   But that that's one thing that goes a little bit towards okay
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:34.260]   Well, you know presumably these very smart people who were in charge of lots of people and had a lot of responsibility and did important interesting things
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:41.620]   They see something or or they're interested in you know, they see a potential there. That's not just a me too product
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.500]   Well, you know, we'll find out certainly google gets points for you know
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:50.260]   The cardboard is two years old it came out two years ago
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:55.220]   So they get points for really bringing the low-cost vr really before anybody else
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.940]   By the way, that was the coolest giveaway ever
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.940]   Absolutely and was the cheapest
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.820]   And it was just like oh yeah, here's the thing
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:09.140]   I mean real afterthought. Yeah, it was really an afterthought. Yeah, okay. I agree with you
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:14.820]   Remains to be seen what what i've seen so far is is more like a a checkbox
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.820]   A checkmark in a box of features than anything else
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:25.220]   Yeah, we got all these companies are saying is that vr matters to us. Yeah, everybody's in agreement there for they are google has some major
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.420]   Horsepower. I mean they've got some big shots in the vr department
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.060]   So and they have a big investment in magic leap
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:36.980]   My best guess is this isn't the endgame at all not even close to it
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:42.420]   And uh, and when they really go into it, it's going to be more like an augmented reality
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:48.020]   Uh thing and there'll be something much more significant there with a magic leap kind of thing, but yeah
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:53.460]   And just to add one more data point so john wily who was a big designer in the search area
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.220]   He has also gone over to the r so presumably it puts some horses in there
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:03.220]   Right, so we'll I think you're right leo and we'll have to see as time as time goes on how that how that works out
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:09.380]   There was other news in the world now swamped by google i.o. Motorola has apparently killed the moto x
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.260]   It's going to be the moto g
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.100]   for
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.500]   G for play and g for plus you talked about this last night. I know
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.900]   Jason how
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.500]   Yeah, three different devices kind of I don't know what happened
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.060]   Odo x necessarily we've heard a little bit that they might actually come out with a moto
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.940]   Z like the x to z even though sony went from the z to the anyways
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.980]   Um, everybody's playing musical chairs with letters right now
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.780]   Uh, but yeah three three different moto g
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.980]   Devices kind of different scaled, you know for for different price points the play edition
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:52.340]   I think isn't even available quite yet. It's the it's all for india and china as far as I can tell they haven't or i'm sorry
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.340]   South america and uh, india
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:25:00.820]   It really seems like uh like the moto g play is is essentially the moto e but now the moto
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:07.860]   These are inexpensive and we really like the g i like the g a lot. I was a very impressive for a phone for 200 bucks
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.620]   Um, I know it feels like remember linovo now owns them
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:15.460]   And it may be that linovo's decided that we're going to go after the low end of the market
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.540]   We're going to let we're going to let sam sung lg and google fight it out at the high end
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:24.100]   And htc can't forget that nice htc one
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.820]   Uh other stories
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:32.500]   Oh what I can't hear you mad at that's talking go ahead matt
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:37.620]   Oh, I was just going to say speaking of crazy hardware. I don't know if you guys saw some non. Io news
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:41.620]   But some form of g formal google engineers former google engineers
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:51.060]   Uh who are doing auto which is self-driving for trucks auto 8 o t o for truck 18 wheelers. Yeah, that was kind of interesting
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:54.660]   Yeah, I thought that was very uh interesting. We can see if we could pull up a
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:26:00.820]   Yeah, the story there very very cool there because they're not really focused on new big rigs
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.900]   It's all about kind of retrofitting
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:06.740]   Into your existing big rig the self-driving smarts
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.060]   and uh
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:15.860]   And long term basically making it so that drivers of these these rigs can you know go ahead and sleep in the cab
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.140]   We got this we'll we'll continue driving. Oh, that scares that a lot of me
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:23.460]   Well use you take a rest because you need to rest buddy. So we got this
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:26.180]   Okay
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.500]   There goes auto
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.780]   If you think if you don't think it's scary to see a 13 ton vehicle
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.500]   Sparing down on you and nobody at the wheel
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.540]   Sounds like a steven king novel actually
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.100]   Nobody to give the finger to
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:50.180]   Well
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:56.500]   Being on the road and looking into the cab of the big wig so big rig and realizing there's no one there
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.740]   Yet you're driving right next to or in front of it. That would be kind of frightening
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:07.860]   Yes, and it's so funded apparently all the they can see funds. They're just like, okay
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.460]   We've earned enough money from our various, you know encounters
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:18.100]   We're gonna we're gonna do it ourselves and that's the ultimate, you know liberty and independence when you don't need to worry about what a vc guy says so
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.700]   Yeah
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.380]   You know they're crazy your ideas. I mean this is this is one of the probably this great niche in this
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.380]   autonomous vehicle thing and probably the first place you'll see autonomous vehicles
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:35.380]   Is economic savings there are incredible, but I don't want to I don't want to go against the t-pishers, man
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:45.060]   Next yes, you can now add links and photos to your twitter and it won't count against your 140 characters
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:54.660]   Wait wait for five years for this. Hi. Yeah, it's pretty funny. Don't be
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:01.380]   Go ahead. Oh, I was just gonna say immediately somebody was like so then in other words, you can just add infinite links
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:08.500]   One forever and spam twitter with pictures and so maybe they'll say the first link or the first picture doesn't count against you
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:15.300]   It doesn't yeah doesn't solve the canoe problem though. I they should not make at replies count either. That's that should be free
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:18.260]   Handles should be free
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:24.420]   Don't be this guy dad streams wife's birth on facebook live without telling her
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.900]   So
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:32.580]   Apparently what this is I'm looking at it actually a little bit because we're gonna talk about it a little bit on TNT here in a few
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:38.740]   Is that he knew that he was recording or sharing it to his family and friends?
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.020]   He didn't realize that he was broadcasting it out to facebook live
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:48.820]   So apparently there's some confusion there on what it means to live stream when you think you're live streaming to a group
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:56.180]   Versus the biggest group of the world, which is everybody the videos now been viewed more than 100,000 times
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:03.140]   And his wife Sarah said she definitely did not realize it at the time. She was occupied so
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:07.460]   Yes, she said she did however realize it afterwards
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:11.620]   Good news eight pound healthy baby boy
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:17.540]   And uh, she she was more mad about getting pregnant than she was about the video. I think she said
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.540]   It's
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.820]   Named named zuck zuck named the baby zuck
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.100]   How not to be a supportive partner in that
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.740]   Well
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:34.580]   Just crazy. You didn't know right facebook did release of I thought a very sweet
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:38.580]   360 degree film made at grand central station
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:44.420]   Using the first one using their 30,000 dollar surround 360 camera
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:50.420]   Uh, it's it's pretty cool. Uh, I wonder though. How much of it is staged and how much of it is real because
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:55.380]   Um, you see families kissing each other good by I mean, it's it's really kind of neat
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.100]   Um like this guy
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:02.020]   I have to think this guy's not really looking at anything
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:07.940]   Um, there's there's a later. Yeah, this it feels like a lot of this was actors, right?
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:14.500]   Yeah, I mean when you watch it, you know, you're you're kind of looking around and then suddenly you hear a voice come in
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:19.620]   From from a different direction you turn around and what do you know? They're standing perfectly
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:25.060]   Perfectness away from the camera having a total conversation about something that you connect with but it
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:29.380]   It moves away, but it's still very cool. It kind of shows you though the potential for
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:37.460]   Drama right here's the family. They're gonna say these are clearly actors. They're gonna say goodbye to each other and it's it kind of beautiful moment
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:44.260]   Um, but it gives you the it's some idea of what this could be if you were trying to do a movie a theater
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:49.300]   You know, this is not the New York. I know. Yeah, this doesn't happen. Great. Where's the bums?
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:54.580]   Yeah, you know, my parents who's dropped me off outside and be like get back. Yeah, get in. Yeah, go go to school. Look at this
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:31:00.820]   Now honey. I want you to stay away from those bad men with the funny cigarettes. Okay, mom
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:05.780]   Anyway, you know, there's there's a lot of overacting going on there
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:09.060]   There was a person taking a picture of the camera that seemed real
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:13.460]   Seemed real exactly. Uh, this guy we think that's real
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:18.420]   Yeah, that's real. No, I don't think it is. I honestly think this is all staged
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:24.100]   Uh, here's a guy with a go pro walking around taking pictures of people without their knowledge
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.140]   There's a woman giving birth on facebook live
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.860]   It's it's all here
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:34.660]   The apple store. Can you zoom in on the apple store? Uh, is that what's up there? We're it was
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.740]   The apple store. Yeah. Yeah, that's the apple store. I don't know if I have the zooming
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.940]   Zooming. Can you look at the ceiling? Yeah, can you look at the ceiling? You know, it's it's beautiful
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:47.460]   And a lot of people don't know that constellations are up there. So you should really uh
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:53.460]   Yeah, I'm getting nauseous. You should look up there. It's kind of pretty. I love grand central station
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:59.220]   Oh, it's gorgeous. There's the actual troops protecting it with their automatic weapons
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.340]   Um, yeah, I feel like some of this is real
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:05.700]   Some of it not
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:08.660]   Anyway, it's when we all become extras
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.540]   We're all extras in mark zuckerburg's uh life
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.740]   All the world's the stage and world sectors in it. Yeah
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:22.020]   Yep, man also undergoes a live cosmetic surgery on facebook. This facebook live thing is completely out of control
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:23.220]   Yes
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:26.740]   I just want to say and we're not going to show that video. Don't worry
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:32.740]   It's like it's periscope, right? But on facebook. Oh, but it's but it brings a social layer. That's the thing
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.340]   Yeah, no, you know, hundred thousand people saw that birth. I mean
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.340]   I
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.300]   Were the comments
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:49.460]   I think the comments were locked into the family and friends that were watching so the comments were super positive like you got this
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:53.220]   You're doing it. You're doing it girl. You go girl. Breathe
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.420]   Breathe
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:57.780]   I may I
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.620]   Went my wife showing our family. She would never really gone for that either. No
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:05.220]   No, no, I was told explicitly no cameras
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.260]   Uh, no, she knew my wife knew I
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:11.460]   It's definitely a conversation you have before the event
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.020]   You didn't know just decide on
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.180]   I don't even have to go to live stream to my friends family
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.620]   It's uh, so it's honey. I live stream the kids
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:24.500]   Showtiles
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:30.260]   Let's take a break. We'll get picks tips numbers anything you guys want to share as we wrap this up our
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:35.140]   It's very special this week in google partly because it's on google. Io day
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.980]   But mostly because of the great panel we have here Jason howl from tnt
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.700]   We don't usually get you on the show and i'm thrilled to have you
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.740]   Sitting right next to jeff javis who is also at the google plex
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:49.700]   The best panel ever. This is amazing. Isn't it fun?
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:55.860]   And of course we welcome back our dearest and oldest friend jina trapani who we hope will see much more of
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:34:00.660]   Going forward on the show, but you know what you go from the frying pan into the fire
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:07.060]   Now you're like a big shot and you got lots to do for this digital media empire and i don't think
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.660]   I have only get her once in a while probably always be around
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.540]   Yeah, we just adore you and of course
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:19.220]   It wouldn't be this week in google without the wonderful matt cuts. We just love having him on
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.260]   What's your 30 day challenge are you on one?
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:28.420]   I'm kind of slacking on this one, but i'm trying to be grateful for one two to three things every day
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:34.740]   Not writing them down so i'm it's kind of a week a month off basically, but you know i've been thankful thankful a couple times
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:41.300]   You need to be on twig counts for these three days. I'm thankful for being one with such a great panel. I mean wow
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.340]   You know, I actually had a bot
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:49.220]   A grateful bot. Let me see if I can find that for you. I could make that my tip of the week
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.980]   In the morning at night. It sent me a text saying what are you grateful for?
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:57.540]   And then you you enter in and what you're grateful for and it keeps track of it
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:00.180]   I won't want this is what you grew up before
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:06.740]   Can't keep your edge this that was the first bot that I thought poncho was driving me crazy
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.620]   Like I said it was a stalker. I had to block him, but uh, but the grateful bot i kind of i mean i turned it off
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:16.180]   But uh because after a while, it's like, okay, thanks. I don't need to be needled
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.180]   but uh
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:22.500]   I'm grateful being grateful is a very good thing. I I think that's one of the best things you could
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.060]   Keep in your head. Sure. Yeah
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.220]   Another good thing you could do for yourself and your loved ones too

[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:03.940]   Um, but he also has this kind of great worldly way. He's not there's nothing airy fairy about this
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:06.500]   It really is about relaxation

[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:48.420]   Jason I won't ask you for a pick because you've got well you got all about android you got the android app arena my god
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.860]   You you're the last man standing when it comes to picks you got one. All right go on all right
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:57.220]   We didn't talk about google spaces at all with there you go
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:04.580]   It's not announced at google. I owe it was announced a couple of days ago, which is yes a messaging app of sorts
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:10.100]   Uh, so social app too, right? Yeah, it's it's like for small groups essentially small group sharing
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:11.780]   um
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:18.100]   Can you kind of get a bunch of people into a room of sorts and uh share on a specific topic and
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:21.220]   I don't know i've been playing around with it for a couple of days supposedly here
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:29.140]   At google.io each vent is going to have its own space that attendees can kind of hop into and have kind of shared conversation
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.140]   Around a specific topic. So I really i'm hoping that that will
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.900]   Through that experience i'll understand a little bit more about
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.860]   You know what situations in the future I might
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.500]   opt to use spaces for
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:48.260]   Um, but again we were talking earlier in the episode about google kind of bringing it search and all these places
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:52.980]   Search integrated into here. So google search inside the app instead of having to go outside of it
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:56.100]   But also youtube chrome built in all that kind of stuff
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:02.260]   Um interesting stuff. I know yeah mike elgens got uh what he calls the largest space
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:08.580]   Uh, and I think he hit the limit of it says exactly 500 people that would be my guest that that's the limit
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.100]   You can have in his space. It feels like I can't quite figure out
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.540]   I think probably google doesn't even know quite what it is
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.220]   Um, it could be personal like just you and your spouse
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:24.340]   Sharing stuff. It could be a larger group. It's got some of the google plus
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:29.700]   Feeling to it. I a little google wave a little wave in there
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.820]   Yeah
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:37.460]   Yeah, and you know i'm kind of i don't know i'm i'm hesitant to get
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:43.780]   Uh, too excited about it because gosh, I keep throwing so much energy into different social networks with no
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:48.580]   Benefit, but yeah, it's very intriguing. So yeah, we will see and it's free
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:55.860]   Android and ios and web which is nice google spaces.google.com you can check it out
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:58.500]   Yeah, jeff you got a number for us
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.620]   Uh, you know i picked an odd one out which is that um
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:07.140]   Google has had more access to the white house since uh than any other lobbyists
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.820]   In the field and the technology joanna shilton
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:15.300]   Google's director of public policy visited the white house since brock obama took office
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.300]   128 times
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:21.300]   Wow, and the reason i mentioned that is because this is also the day when mark zuckerberg out here in the valley
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.740]   Is supposedly meeting with a whole bunch of conservatives to get over this kerfuffle
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:27.300]   Over the lens back
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:33.940]   When back he's meeting glenn back i put up a picture of mark meeting with all the star wars characters and i thought but chubaka was glenn back
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.300]   Um just to joke people don't get all mad at me
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:42.980]   Um, I didn't make a bernie joe because i'll please stay easy. He's he's he calmed down
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:51.700]   Um, so i i did the i'm fascinated right now with with politics and our alternative government out here at mountain view and our and our other
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:57.460]   The valley and our other capital that was my number. That was it not very exciting, but then no it's very exciting day
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:02.580]   It's there's a lot to talk about and a short number is fine with me and i'm sure with everybody
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.540]   Everybody else jeena i see you have a pic also
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:10.580]   I just have a really quick tip that this actually came out a couple of weeks ago, but it was new to me
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:14.660]   Um, little tip in the in the play store, you know the play store is showing you now if an app
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:18.420]   Contains ads it says it right up front all right on the tin
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:21.620]   Um, you know when you go to the play store would tell you if an app has in app purchases
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:25.700]   Well, now there's a little tag that says contain ads so uh so you can tell whether or not they're gonna be ads
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:29.140]   And they app that you download as it should i love that idea
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.860]   Yeah, a little bit more transparency about what you're getting
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.500]   They've they did that within app purchases first and i let another don't with ads that's fantastic
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.780]   Yep, yep
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:39.940]   I'll give you matt cuts if you want a chance to
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:44.740]   Flog anything you want or tell people about something you like or nothing. It's up to you
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:50.340]   Yeah, no, uh, so i haven't mentioned it in a while, but if you type into google google webmaster blog
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:56.980]   We have a blog with lots of useful resources. So for example, there's something about a mobile friendly testing tool
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:02.100]   That's a brand new blog post that just went out a couple days ago and you can type in any url
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:06.020]   Like google.com and it will say yes, this page is mobile friendly
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:12.180]   Um, but that's just one blog post they've they've you know if you look at the last thing they're talking about something called rich cards
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:18.260]   which is uh basically taking rich snippets and making it so that you can do better things with structured data
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:23.060]   Which uh, oh some people have been asking us, you know, how do you how do you feel about structured data these days?
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:29.220]   So this is you know a nice way to to bolster the fact that we do care about that and if you keep going you'll find out things like how
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:35.540]   webspam the webspam team fought webspam in 2015 which is a very interesting blog post to me at least so uh, yeah
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:40.580]   The google webmaster blog is there lots of free resources to help you make better websites and do better in general
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.140]   I can't show you my pick because I don't have a chromebook in front of me
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.500]   But those you guys have chromebooks in front of you and maybe matt you could tell me how
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:56.100]   New this is if you just discovered it one day i opened the files app in my chromebook and i noticed i could add additional
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.660]   um file systems
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:03.300]   To it including Dropbox and sftp so and and web dev
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:10.260]   So if you have a dropbox account and you want the files on your chromebook to show up as part of your file system
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:14.020]   You just add it and it's really easy to i know
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:17.780]   Do you know when they added this guys because this is the first i just like what whoa
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:23.380]   Uh, same as secure ftp which is great. So if you have a secure ftp server running somewhere
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:26.900]   This would be a great way to add additional storage
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:33.620]   Uh for your chromebook that a secure safe place you could keep that stuff and it's part of the files hierarchy
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:37.300]   So it just shows up as another folder in your files hierarchy
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.060]   Wow
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:44.260]   Yeah, so yeah, now matt you probably knew all about that but i i i actually didn't know about this
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:50.900]   So it says install new web services or and you can you can have dropbox windows one drive sftp all sorts of great
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.260]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:54.260]   That is
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:44:01.460]   Yeah, another reason to love chrome os and how how common are chromebooks really with staff here
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:05.540]   Oh with staff here very popular. I mean it's basically
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.020]   Whenever
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:13.780]   China hacked google there was a move away from windows and interesting. Oh, it's interesting
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.220]   It's usually mac books or chromebooks around here
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:23.940]   Well and uh dave sniders crouton which we've talked about before and i used and i know jeff you use it to put skype on your chromebook
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:30.500]   Um and i'd kind of pride. Yeah, I I thought it was kind of a hacky thing when i used it a couple of years ago
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:34.260]   It's gotten better and better and better and you can now put debbie in on there
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:39.860]   You could put other distributions they have all sorts of nice features in this he's really uh
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:47.060]   Up the ani and then of course contributors have up the ani because you can create your own charout and and you're you what do you got there?
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:49.060]   You got it you're downloading it
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:52.820]   Well, we're getting the uh, we're getting the uh android is upgrading optimizing
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.940]   Yeah, well you're they haven't gotten rid of it yet, Jason
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.100]   Maybe that's the last time the last time it will never again
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:05.300]   All right, what is it by the way? What is it doing when it's doing that?
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:12.820]   Ah, it might be well, they said um the just-in-time compiler made it better with uh, right new jit
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:17.620]   It may be i mean, there's the android run time the art stuff and so maybe it's recompiling
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.860]   I you know, why don't i wait for me at hand?
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:22.740]   I remember reading at one point was it symbol tables or something?
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.980]   Do you remember jina why it has to take all that time churning through every app?
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:30.500]   I should have taken the time that I was waiting for it to be done to read
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.940]   I would have had I would have had the time to do that, but I didn't
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:40.260]   It has to do with it has to do with dalvik and art and and uh, I believe it's pre compiling
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:46.660]   Uh in some way because remember these are these are jvm's that are
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.460]   uh being used on the system
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:53.540]   Uh can read bytecode, but they also can read something a little bit more
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:59.140]   Close to the metal and I believe that that's what's going on that there's a some sort of pre compile
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:05.300]   Step, I read about this once and I don't but anyway, it's a pain in the frickin button. I'm so glad they're getting rid of it
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:11.380]   Thank you. So this do we have the new jit now? Is that once we do this update is the we say goodbye to that?
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.740]   It's I don't know if it's in this beta version, but it sounds like they're shooting for it to be an end
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.940]   Oh, it'd be so nice the facebook being just wrapped
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.540]   All right
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:26.740]   Seacup says it's a good brian's shelter at cnn who's the what crack meteor meteor love ryan
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:32.020]   Yeah, brian is the greatest said that uh that the conservators did a lot more talking to the facebook people that he
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.260]   Zuckerberg was taking it seriously
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:40.100]   Um, so he's in listening mode. He's a listening mode. We're just smart. He ought to be
