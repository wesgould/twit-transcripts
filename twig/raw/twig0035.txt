[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.

[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.160]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.320]   episode 35, for March 28, 2010, Dancing Naked Money.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.760]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520]   to show the covers everything in the Google
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.440]   verse and the cloud as well.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.640]   Joining us right now, we're really
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.080]   glad to have the usual cast of characters,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.000]   including Mr. Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.440]   and the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.000]   The author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   Gina Trapani, founder of Life Hacker and blogger at smarterware.org.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.040]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.560]   Hi.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.640]   And our special guests this week always
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640]   welcome love having him from British Telecom, former Googler
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.760]   and Appler, Mr. Kevin Marks.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.800]   And every time I introduce you, Kevin, I've
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   got to also say the father of podcasting,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   because he was the first to demonstrate using an RSS feed
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.040]   with enclosures to distribute audio files.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   Onto an iPod.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   Onto an iPod.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.440]   That was the key.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.480]   That was the piece I added.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.840]   You beat Adam and Dave and everybody else.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.440]   Well, I was working with them.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.840]   They were making the feeds at the time.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.040]   I guess if there weren't something to do to show.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.480]   So you're one of a triumvirate of pod fathers.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   Well, this was the week that Google finally pulled the plug.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   I didn't credit all the bloggers who said 99.9%.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   Certainty that Google will pull the plug on China,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   but it's true a couple of weeks later on Monday this week.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   Google finally said, all right, we're
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.360]   going to take all of the filtered results at Google.cn
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   and forward people to Google.hk, which is unfiltered.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.200]   China's response immediately was, we
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   wish people would adhere to our law.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   Have they blocked Google yet though?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640]   If you go to the friend feed, Leo,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.760]   there is a page that Google put up showing current status.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.160]   And mainland service availability, it's Google.com/prc.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.840]   So it says that web search is up.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   YouTube is still down, has been down, the site is down.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.960]   As is bloggers down.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.240]   Yep.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   Now, by web search being up, does that
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.720]   mean that it's redirecting to Hong Kong?
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960]   I would guess so, since that's what they're doing.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.360]   So it means that--
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.080]   So they haven't blocked that then.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.200]   China could, and I'm sure will at some point, just say,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.120]   hey, if it's Google.hk, you're not getting it.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   I mean, they're already blocking Google.com.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.720]   So if it's Google.hk, you can't get in.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.480]   Do we know what they're not?
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.280]   They're doing it.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   Go ahead.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.120]   No, I was just asking you, do we know whether or not
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.560]   they're blocking hk yet?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.960]   No, since they're not.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.360]   According to Google.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   But Kevin, you said you thought they were.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   They were blocking stuff that goes to it.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.680]   So what they're doing is they're blocking certain searches.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.000]   So they do keyword-based blocking as well.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.680]   So depending on what you search for, it may not get through.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.640]   So if you search for Faloon Gong, even though you're on
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.280]   Google.hk, you're not going to see any results.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.720]   It's what they do with CNN.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.240]   They don't block CNN in China.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.400]   It's just if something they don't like is on CNN.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.280]   It goes black.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.720]   You're sitting in the hotel room.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.640]   You're watching CNN International.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.840]   Well, then it goes black for two minutes, and it comes back.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.360]   And you know, well, Sonny must have been talking about
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.600]   something that Chinese government didn't like.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.640]   It doesn't even settle here.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   No, it's obvious.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.760]   And everybody in China knows that that's what's happening.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   It's just--
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.800]   I mean, how many people do they have doing this?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   It seems like this giant game of losing game of whack-a-mole.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.320]   I mean, they've got to have hundreds and hundreds of people
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   figuring out what's OK and what's not and blocking it.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.760]   I mean, am I being totally naive?
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.200]   I mean, I'm sure that a lot of it is automated, but--
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440]   No, they got a lot of people in China.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.400]   China's full of--
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.960]   I've heard.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   In fact, if there's one resource China has, it's people.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   It's people.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.960]   Yeah, it's--
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.640]   It's dangerous full employment act, yeah?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.840]   Yeah, it's made of people.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   So here's that page, Mainland China Service Availability.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.520]   And you know, there's still green check marks
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.640]   all the way across from web search.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.640]   But I guess that would mean merely
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.480]   that the service is getting there, not
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.320]   whether it's being, you know, somewhat.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.760]   So there was Rebecca McKinnon's congressional testimony
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.040]   on this.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.160]   I can just put the link in.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.720]   Yeah, I see your link here.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.520]   That was very good, because she discusses
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   what it's actually like inside China.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.920]   That's definitely worth reading.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.680]   So she talks about a bunch of things that they do, which
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.240]   is even more subtle, even more insidious.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920]   I'm trying to remember the exact phrase.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.800]   She's a Princeton professor.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.440]   Is she in China right now?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.880]   Or do you know--
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   Yes, she goes back and forth.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.440]   OK.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.800]   She teaches there in, of course, former CNN journalist
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.360]   producer.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.080]   That's right.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.480]   I knew I knew-- I'm follower on Twitter.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.120]   I knew I knew I knew it.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   Rebecca is great and knows her stuff.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.520]   She was one of the founders of-- with Ethan Zuckerman,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560]   of Global Voices at the Harvard Berkman Center.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.000]   Of course.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Yes.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.120]   And so she talks about the Chinese refer to it
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.600]   as self-discipline.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.040]   So they don't actually give you a blacklist.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   They just say, you should know what to block.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.520]   So part of the point of this is that it's a chilling effect.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.960]   It's not a--
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   they have some automated blacklist stuff.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.720]   But the other thing is, if something gets through,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   and they will hold you responsible for it as an ISP.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.920]   So when you say you, it means the ISP.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.320]   Yes.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.280]   Are there independent ISPs in China?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.920]   I don't know how independent anything is in China
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.360]   is subject to question.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.680]   But the point is, if you run a business there that
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.240]   connects stuff to the internet, you're
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.200]   expected to have self-discipline about what is shown.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.360]   Yes.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.960]   Self-censorship due to surveillance.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   And backed up by surveillance and backed up, as you say,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.840]   by people actually looking at it and complaining
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.680]   to the government and asking stuff back and forth as well.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.720]   They expect you to rat on your customers.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.040]   And of course, they also have recently implemented a requirement
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.640]   that if you want to have a Wi-Fi access point in China,
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.000]   you've got to submit a picture, photo ID.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   I mean, you've got to basically register with the police.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.000]   And the only company that's followed Google
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.040]   has had the guts to follow Google, of course,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.440]   is oddly enough, GoDaddy.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.800]   Well, now, wait a minute.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.400]   If you ask me, this was the most cynical thing.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.640]   Bob Parsons is known for this crap.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   Cynical like, oh.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   No, Leo.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.120]   No, wait a minute.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.760]   It's 0.01% of their business.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.640]   Nobody registers GoDaddy.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.720]   I don't know.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.520]   If you register domains in China, they
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   have to hand over full ID and photos and all kinds of stuff.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.200]   So they say, well, we're not going to play.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.280]   But really, it's a press release.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.960]   It's not.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.680]   It costs them nothing.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.120]   By the way--
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.280]   Yeah, that was just their way of saying
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.080]   where the first company to follow suit with Google,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.680]   they were just trying to ride the hotels.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.640]   That's my opinion.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.200]   I don't want to give them any credit.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.280]   I think their commercials were getting blocked
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.960]   and they had to leave.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.680]   Danica Patrick is not allowed.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   No, I think this is--
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.520]   GoDaddy is one of the most cynical, repulsive marketing
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.240]   companies ever.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.400]   And I completely--
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.080]   I think you're being cynical now.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.800]   Gina knows what I'm talking about.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.240]   I am right there with you.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.120]   We're right there with you.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   I love in this.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.440]   I give them no credit whatsoever.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   Google, on the other hand, there was some debate
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.720]   we were talking on Windows Weekly in Paul Therat saying,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.080]   to a little too late.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.240]   I give Google a lot of credit, regardless of the fact
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.480]   that they didn't do it early on.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   And there was a great article in the Wall Street Journal
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.520]   that says it's Sergey Brin that was the force behind getting
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.000]   out of China that even though they didn't do it
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.280]   and there was some internal dissent,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.320]   this is a publicly held company turning its back
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.240]   in the world's largest internet market.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.960]   There are more internet users in China
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   than there are people in the US.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.480]   And it's not an easy thing to do as a publicly held company.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.400]   I commend you for doing this.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.240]   I think it is that Leo and Moore.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.120]   I wrote a column for The Guardian that'll be on Monday,
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.400]   arguing that Google is acting as the ambassador.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.000]   I've said this show before from the internet to the world
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.920]   and is in fact defending the internet
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.880]   and defending internet principles.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.240]   And as I thought that through, in essence,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.120]   what Google has done is defended the internet principles
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.000]   that Google itself has set.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.280]   And I don't mean to make a bad analogy here,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.840]   but I think it's a good analogy for other reasons.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.360]   If you compare companies divesting in South Africa
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.040]   through apartheid, and again, I don't mean to say
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.280]   that cyber repression is the same as physical
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   and economic and racial repression in South Africa.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.480]   Nonetheless, it came to a point where companies said
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.080]   that we cannot do this.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.840]   As the congressmen said this week in the US,
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.920]   it's one matter to go alone with the laws,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.160]   another matter to help them do what they're doing.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.960]   And so in South Africa, we have the Sullivan principles.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   Sullivan principles were set forth saying that,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.000]   "Company, if you want to do business in South Africa,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.840]   you must do the following, or you have to leave,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   or we're going to divest your stock here
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   in the rest of the world.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.560]   You had to be able to employ people of all races
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.800]   and under good conditions and so on."
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so what happened there was that there ended up being
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.040]   a popular movement in campuses and other places
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.800]   to get companies to divest South Africa.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.480]   So it occurred to me that we really need our own set
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.600]   of principles, our own kind of bill of rights,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.760]   which I put in my blog this afternoon,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.320]   my humble first crack at it, but our idea of principles.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.360]   And until we see a popular movement to support freedom
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.080]   on the internet all around, not just China,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.840]   then I think we're going to see Google standing alone.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.800]   And I think it's, I'm rather ashamed of our government,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.200]   our companies, but mainly of us as internet users
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.040]   that we have not stood up with Google
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.560]   on these matters of high principle.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.600]   And they are that.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.720]   - You agree, Gina?
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.160]   You think that Google is not being cynical
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.800]   and that they're actually, this is a bold, brave thing to do?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.640]   - I do agree, but you know,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.120]   and I'm going to play devil advocate, right?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.560]   So the opposite argument, the opposite way to look at it
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.200]   is that by pulling out of China,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   they're going against their corporate mission, right?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.400]   Which is to organize the world's information
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.480]   and make it accessible and useful to everyone.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.640]   I could see, and I don't necessarily think that,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.720]   but I can see somebody saying,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.960]   if Google can make some of the world's information accessible
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.360]   in China on their terms, shouldn't they be?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.200]   I don't think that. - But they could
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.040]   get their terms.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.640]   That was the problem, Gina, they couldn't.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.880]   And so what they said was,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.040]   these are our terms and our principles.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.760]   We will serve you in China,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.480]   but only under our principles, not yours China.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.320]   - You know, right now,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.640]   Google's got the best of both worlds.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.960]   They're still doing business in China,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.320]   they're still usable, and a few things are filtered.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.120]   And they can say, hey, we did it.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.520]   And we haven't lost the market.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.040]   - The way they should have done it originally.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.920]   Kevin, what do you think?
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.720]   - No, I think that's, I think this is a personal thing
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.400]   for Sergey, I think that is true.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   I think he was always the one pulling back on that.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   And they've talked about that before.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.600]   And so that makes sense for him to be leading
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.480]   the discussion of it in public.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.600]   The other, I think Jeff's bill of,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.160]   I just read Jeff's bill of rights thing through,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.080]   and I think that's a very good thing.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.920]   Something I wanted to link that up to was,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.320]   something I wrote this week,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.480]   which was comparing the Rebecca's stuff about China
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.240]   with the proposed digital economy bill in the UK,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.480]   where they are proposing to let people
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.720]   arbitrary disconnect.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.840]   Now, it's not government censorship.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.720]   In this case, it's music industry censorship,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.560]   copyright holders can take you off the net,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.480]   and it's like sort of DMCA worse.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.280]   But they are also dashing it through parliament
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.560]   without any debate, because the parliament's about
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.280]   to be shut down for the election.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.200]   And so they're gonna try and get this bill through
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   on the nod without anyone debating it in the House of Commons.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.960]   - So what does the bill say?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.440]   - The bill, let me give you my personal opinion.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.560]   It's not well written, I wouldn't quote it, it lay.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.840]   - Kevin, Kevin, you were slumming it.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.320]   - It's written in the British accent,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.000]   so it's gonna sound good, even if it's not.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.320]   So we're going to have to pay--
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.800]   - How is a brass and injunction against a service provider
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.640]   to prevent access to online locations specified
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   in the order of the court for the prevention
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.280]   of online copyright infringement?
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.840]   The court shall order the service provider
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.400]   to pay the copyright owners costs of the application,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.480]   unless there are exceptional circumstances,
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.200]   justifying the service provider's failure to prevent access,
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.400]   despite notifications by the copyright owner.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.520]   So they're basically asking for the ability to get an injunction
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.200]   that the copyright holders costs can be paid
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.240]   if they get that injunction,
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.040]   and that the copyright holders expect to be able to demand
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.080]   that the ISP takes down,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.320]   take not just takes down, but blocks access to a site
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.680]   on allegation before they go to court.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.440]   That's, you know, this is clause 18 in the bill,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.120]   so that's sort of big and pretty scary.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.000]   - This isn't exactly actor, but it's--
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.400]   - It's along the lines of actor.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.520]   I mean, if you want to look at passing the enabling
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.960]   legislation for actor, it's definitely along the same line.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.160]   So the actor's stuff that was released
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.000]   includes a whole bunch of steps that match these very well.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.600]   So the post that I did is,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.040]   I was basically comparing Rebecca's China stuff
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   to the clauses here, and the parallels are kind of scary.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.680]   - Yeah.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.520]   - Are you going to there, okay?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.600]   - Yeah, so right here, BPIs, China-like clauses.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.800]   This is the BPIs, the digital--
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.760]   - The British phonographic industry.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.800]   (snorts)
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   - That's what they're called.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   (snorts)
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.520]   - It's the phonographic industry is--
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   - Right, there is--
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.800]   - She's Louise.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.640]   - So, you know, if you actually, you know,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   this bill is a fairly nasty bit of legislation anyway.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.320]   I've read about it before.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.280]   It also had like sort of backstop clauses
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.840]   in it that let the minister make up any law
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.680]   he wanted subsequently.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.920]   Some of those have been removed.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.800]   The second thing that they have is that
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   they have this sort of idea of self-discipline as well.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.920]   They're basically trying to eat away at
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   what you call common carrier here,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   what we call mere conduit in Europe,
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.440]   which is if I'm an ISP, I'm not liable
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.920]   for what people post online.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.160]   And you know, there's the DMC and the Note-in-Takedown
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.360]   model, which is, they're not actually copying that.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.000]   - Well, in fact, they say you have to take reasonable steps
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.920]   to prevent copyright infringement.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   - Exactly, so they're trying to sort of bring in
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.720]   this intermediary liability thing.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   And then the other thing that they've got is,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.480]   they've got clauses that enable them to take over
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   the dot UK registrar if they feel like it.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.320]   - Oh, wow.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.680]   - Based on the secretary of state deciding its...
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.160]   - So UK registrar is currently not run by the...
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.120]   - It's not run directly by the government.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.560]   It's run by a nominette.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.200]   And you know, it's like, it's kind of like, I can.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.760]   I don't know, it's really well,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.520]   but it's semi-independent, it's not a government-owned piece.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.520]   - So they give some criteria for why that may happen.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.080]   - Right, but it's, you know, it's arbitrary.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.280]   The secretary of state can make it up.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   And they say, practices that are unaffirmable
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.320]   the misuse of domains, if it's likely to adversely affect
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   the reputation of available electronic communication
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.720]   networks in the United Kingdom.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.400]   So basically the secretary of state gets to decide
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.280]   what is misuse and what is reputation
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.360]   and can then take over the registrar who's doing it.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   - So it really is like the Chinese,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.880]   it's very much like the Chinese government.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.760]   - It's got to stop.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.800]   - There's sort of very much a lack of due process stuff here.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.120]   It's like, okay, we're gonna put a law that says
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   we can take over your business if we feel like it.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.040]   - But this isn't a long tradition of British,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.760]   I mean, the government, I just saw "Pirate Radio."
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.600]   - I love "Pirate Radio."
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.720]   - What a wonderful movie.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.240]   And which one point one of the British ministers say,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.280]   well, we just make a law.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.120]   We don't like it.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.480]   Okay, we just make it-- - It's a little rough in here.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.560]   - Yeah, the point exactly says that's the point
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   of being the government, we just make a law.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.200]   - Well, the parallel is very exact.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.280]   Well, it's interesting though,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.960]   that the record industry is on the opposite side
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.800]   of it this time around.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.640]   - Isn't it funny?
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.560]   - So "Radio Caroline in the '60s" was,
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.200]   the reason we call it "Piracies"
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.520]   is because they were broadcasting
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.000]   out for international waters.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.600]   So that's what they were called "Pirate Radio"
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.640]   because they were outside "Leables Your Restriction."
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.240]   - And they were playing "Rock and Roll."
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.080]   - Roll.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   - That's exact.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.720]   So it's, at that time, this was how the record industry
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.320]   got their music out.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.920]   So for them, and suddenly, like 40 years later,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.600]   they're on the opposite side of this battle.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.680]   - No more piracy.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.760]   - No, so something said this week,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.080]   we should stop calling them pirates.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.120]   It's like, well, you started calling them pirates
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.480]   in the first place, but it came from "Pirate Radio."
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.760]   It wasn't, you didn't suddenly become called afterwards.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.440]   This is something that, you used to be called
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.280]   what happened to you is the sort of reaction there.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.480]   - We have had a fun time on Twitch
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.040]   trying to come up with a substitute for the word piracy.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.640]   And I can't remember what we came up with,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.080]   but it was suitably kind of euphemistic.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.200]   You know?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.520]   I can't remember.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.360]   We'll have to call it.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.080]   - Well, I think it is a question begging thing, you know,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   but piracy, you know, piracy.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.600]   - Oh yeah, data molesters.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.720]   We call them data molesters.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.640]   - Data molesters, yeah.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.120]   (laughing)
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.320]   - You got your child molesters,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   you got your data molesters, you're equally bad.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.840]   - You've got to be careful there.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.320]   There's someone we're using that in parliament
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.160]   in the week, I'm sure.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.000]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.160]   In fact, it's always been, you know,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.360]   child pornography is always a stalking horse for all of this
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.000]   or in the case of China, just pornography in general.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.760]   Well, we're not blocking anything but pornography.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.480]   - Right, that was the Chinese government's response.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.240]   Every government blocks pornography in sedition
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.200]   and then they'll list the things that nobody else blocks.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.120]   (laughing)
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.080]   - Look, you can't see Nazi memorabilia in Germany.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.920]   So why should you be able to see Tiananmen Square in China?
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.000]   - I like, so let's go through your bill of rights.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.560]   Jeff, maybe you want to clarify or--
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.720]   - Yeah, we don't need to go through it all,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.840]   but the only point was that we need some set of principles
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   and I'm not saying it comes from governance at all.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.600]   Rebecca had talked about,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   after you have John Perry Barlow's declaration
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   of independence for cypress space,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.000]   Rebecca had talked about a constitution,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.440]   but I think that goes against the tenets
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.880]   of what Barlow says,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.080]   which is that we don't have governance, we have freedom.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.400]   But it did occur to me that we do need some level
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.240]   of principles to at least contrast government action to
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.960]   and company action to at various times.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.920]   So I think it gets down at a fairly simple level,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.280]   I can cut it to as quick,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.840]   is that we need to claim and secure our freedom to connect,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.600]   speak, assemble, and act online.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.760]   - I have to control our own identities and data.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.560]   We need to be able to speak our languages.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.200]   We need to protect both of what is public and private
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.840]   and we need to assure openness.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.560]   That's the reader's digest version
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.400]   of what all those 10 things say.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.000]   - You know, I've, I did it tongue in cheek,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.400]   but it becomes more and more real.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.640]   I've suggested that the second amendment,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.600]   which is the right to bear arms,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.040]   should really be modified the right to bear data.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.000]   And that ultimately in the long run,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.680]   you know, the whole point of the second amendment
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.640]   was to fight tyranny and make sure that the populace was armed.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.400]   I think the best way to fight tyranny these days
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.360]   is with a free and open internet.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.760]   - Love that, love that.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.680]   - And maybe that's the new second amendment.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   - Right, yes.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   - Yeah.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.080]   - Right there with the other.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.920]   - But that was the whole--
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.760]   - But that was the whole--
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.000]   - The whole point for the '90s, wasn't it?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.560]   It was, they decided that encryption was a munition
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.920]   and therefore could not be exported from the US.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.680]   And that that was eventually fought back.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.320]   But then if you're gonna treat this stuff like arms,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.760]   then you, then we should make sure
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.360]   that we have the same protections there.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.200]   - Sure.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.280]   - That's a very US-centric view though.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.120]   And then UK--
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.560]   - There's the right to bear arms.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.400]   - The whole idea of bills and decorations and things
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.960]   against your countrymen is so US.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.880]   (laughing)
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.680]   - 6088 Bill of Rights in the UK is what it's all based on.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.760]   It has tracked back through.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.920]   - I think it goes back to the Magna Carta.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.200]   - Well, that was my other blog first.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.440]   I did the digital economy bill compared
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.600]   to the Magna Carta as well.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.920]   - Oh, I like that.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.240]   - That was a lot of fun.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.040]   Because the Magna Carta is actually very liberal with it.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.600]   It's like this Lord is now.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.520]   - Who's the nobles this time around though, us?
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.680]   - Well, you know, the irony is that the
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.240]   that this was proposed by,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.400]   you know, Baron Mandelson.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.440]   This was the Labour government brought back Peter Mandelson
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.000]   from the European Commission.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.840]   - Well, you're kidding.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.920]   The Magna Carta was suggested by a Baron named Mandelson?
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.760]   - No, no, no.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.600]   - Okay.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.720]   - Now that would be good.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.480]   - The digital economy bill was suggested by Baron Mandelson
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.440]   after the Labour government gave him a peerage
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.200]   to get him back into the politics
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.560]   because he couldn't be elected anymore.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.640]   - Right, right.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.560]   - And Magna Carta has these really nice clauses
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.920]   about trivial offenses and
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.560]   we should not seek to procure from anyone
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.120]   either by our own efforts or by those of a third party,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.920]   anything by which any part of these concessions
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.120]   or liberties might be revoked or diminished.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.280]   Should such a thing be procured,
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.480]   it should be null and void and we will no time make use of it.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.200]   So it has, you know, they have an escape clause
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.280]   that's the opposite.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.680]   That he has an escape clause that says,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.560]   I could make up new law if I feel like it.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.200]   And they have an escape clause that says,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.960]   if we do something that infringes your liberties,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.600]   then it's expressed the illegal.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.440]   - Right.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.240]   - So it's, you know, it's, you know,
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.440]   we don't want to go with that.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.360]   - Freedom is an old idea, I guess is what we can all say.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.600]   And that the means of freedom change over time.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.760]   But the concept is the same.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.440]   And I think free and open internet,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.840]   I think anybody who listens to this show can agree
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.640]   is a vital, has become a vital freedom.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.760]   - Right, so when we face the lack,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   not only the lack of freedom that the Chinese have,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.520]   but the implications of hacking and all that,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.800]   on the internet and what's happening in the UK now,
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.880]   who is fighting for this?
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   Where is the popular outcry on behalf of our internet?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.520]   It's ours to lose.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.120]   And so right now we have, I think,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.040]   just Google again, operating,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.280]   because as usual, they kind of fill in the void
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.320]   that no one else is filling.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.760]   And so they're standing up,
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.280]   they're acting as ambassador or army,
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.160]   but to what principles their own.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.240]   - Right.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.080]   - I still salute them.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.120]   - Oh my God bless someone.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.160]   We didn't, someone has to do it.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.840]   Someone has to fight for the internet.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.240]   But I'm rather ashamed of our community
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.320]   that we're not out there.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.360]   - Well, there is a site, I'm trying to find it.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.680]   There was a Mandelson, any Mandelson site.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.720]   You probably know what it was.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.200]   - There was several, if the open rights group is--
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.760]   - Open rights, that was the one, yeah.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.960]   - Open rights, open rights.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.840]   - Is open rights.org, I think?
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.240]   - Open rights group.org, I think it is.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.160]   It's actually quite low. - Yes, you're right.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.400]   Open rights group.org.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.200]   It's org, so you can get it org.org,
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.560]   because that would be weird.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.440]   (laughing)
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.480]   But it's the open rights group, yeah, that's it.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.560]   So they've been helping coordinate the opposition.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.880]   There's lots of other opposition groups,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.440]   but I'm involved with that.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.920]   I'm on the technical advisory board
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.080]   and has been involved since its founding.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.400]   And this is a big campaign issue for them.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.680]   But the challenge is that all the free front benches
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.880]   of the main parties in the UK are sown up with this.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   So it's actually very, yeah, I think--
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   - Yeah, it's the property--
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.760]   - It's trying to lobby the individual MPs in the UK
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.000]   to get them to actually say, no, hang on a minute,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.560]   we're not gonna rush this through in 45 minutes
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.440]   on the last day of the poll, before the election.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.520]   Can we actually stop this and go back for a debate?
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.240]   'Cause there's a whole bunch of controversial stuff in it.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.960]   - So the open rights group is kind of the EFF of the UK.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.720]   - Yeah, that was the original sort of thinking.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.120]   The EFF is a bit more loyal.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.640]   The EFF employs a lot of lawyers
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.600]   and actually has a lot of legal challenges.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.760]   The open rights group is more like policy and debate.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.840]   - Okay. - That's actual--
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.360]   - So they're more like epic than EFF.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.920]   - Yeah, maybe, it was founded with the intention
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.040]   of being a British EFF.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.160]   That was Danny O'Brien, who works the EFF over here,
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.520]   or did until recently, was the original person
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.760]   who proposed it in the UK.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.000]   - We interviewed him on Floss and talked a lot about this, yeah.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.440]   On Floss Weekly, our open source.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.240]   - Father of life hacks.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.720]   - No, I didn't know that.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.480]   - Danny coined the term life hacks.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.520]   - Oh, that's neat.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.000]   - Yeah, he's the whole reason why life hacker exists.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.520]   It all comes around.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.600]   - Yeah, it sure does.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.440]   It sure does.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.960]   - It's one of the things it's always wonderful about.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.480]   I mean, maybe it's a bad sign, Jeff, to your point,
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.320]   is that there's such a small group of people
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.720]   doing everything, right?
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.040]   We all know each other.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.720]   (laughing)
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.680]   - I've been kind of fascinated by the reaction of the people.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.520]   There's a guardian piece called
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.880]   how China's internet generation broke the silence,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.200]   and there are these photos of Chinese people leaving flowers
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.800]   on the Google logo outside the Google China office.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.880]   - Oh, wow.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.440]   - Which struck me as I was like--
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.800]   - That was so brave.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.600]   - What I've shown up there and done that.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.440]   - So brave.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.200]   - People taking pictures and media.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.000]   I don't know that I would have,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.080]   but I love this piece is a graph
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.200]   kind of halfway down the story
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.440]   that talked about the ways that people post about this online
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.480]   and go around the sensors, right?
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.800]   So this is the thing that I wanna know is like,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.600]   how are the internet savvy people getting around
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.840]   this problem?
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.680]   And I kind of love this.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.800]   It said, "Users are increasingly creative
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   "in the ways that they elude restraints,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.000]   "perhaps using analogies to discuss topics,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.720]   "and increasingly open in their mockery of them.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.640]   "Deleted sites have been quote unquote,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.680]   "been harmonized in reference to calls
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.240]   "for a harmonious society.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.440]   "Sensors are referred to as river crabs
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.520]   "because in Chinese, those two words together
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.560]   "form a homophone for harmony."
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.480]   - Chinese is by the way wonderfully suited
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.920]   to this kind of stuff.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.400]   It's a language that's made for misdirection.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.120]   I mean, it's a great history of it.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.160]   So I'm not surprised that they've chosen that.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.960]   You can't suppress this stuff.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.800]   It's like water.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.640]   You cannot suppress it in the long run.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.400]   - Gina, do you go back to what you said before?
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.160]   I'll put it bluntly.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.400]   How cynical are you about Google's motives on this?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.000]   - Not very.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.760]   I think Google should be a little more skeptical.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.840]   A skeptical.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.120]   I think-- - Oh, I know which should too.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.200]   So it was more devil's advocate, yeah.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.800]   - Yeah, I think they're doing the right thing.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.120]   I think they're doing it for the right reasons.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.760]   I buy it.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.480]   But I think that it's important to think about
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   what the implications are for people who depend on Google
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.160]   for their business in China.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.080]   And if you think about their corporate motto,
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.920]   if you think about it,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.320]   there is an argument for people to say
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.400]   they should have just stayed under China's terms
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.240]   and kept looking at that.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.640]   - Well, that was the argument for going in.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.040]   And that's what-- - Right.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:45.880]   - That was the argument for going in.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.440]   - Somehow by being present there,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.280]   this might, by the way,
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.120]   it's Microsoft's argument for staying.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   And it's, you know, let's not forget
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.480]   that Google did the right thing,
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.640]   but Microsoft, Yahoo and a hundred other companies have not.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.480]   - So it's going to help--
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.680]   - It did like trying to change from the inside, right?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.920]   So this is always a debate when you talk about revolution.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.400]   Do you go in and compromise and try to change from the inside
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.720]   or do you just do walk out and say,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.240]   I don't want anything to do with you?
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.560]   - But if there's never pressure against the regime--
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.400]   - And it's pressure against the regime.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.720]   - And it's pressure against the regime.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.800]   - Sorry, Jeff.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.440]   - If there's never pressure against the regime,
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.560]   there will be no change.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.400]   - Right.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.920]   - I think you do both. - No, it was pressure against the regime.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.760]   - You do both.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.240]   If Microsoft wants to change from within, okay.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080]   - Yeah, what are they gonna do?
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.920]   (laughing)
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.760]   - Yeah, that's where I get sick.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.320]   - Oh yeah, Microsoft is in there,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.800]   just lobbying for free speed.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.520]   - You know, the real reason Microsoft's in there
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.280]   is because Microsoft's software is the most pirated software
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.040]   in China, they lose billions of dollars a year in China.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.360]   And so their position is,
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.040]   well, the only way we can try to change this
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.280]   is by keeping a good relationship with the regime
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.160]   and trying to get them to make better copyright laws
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.440]   in China, which is never gonna happen, Microsoft.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.360]   - Right.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   - But that's, you know, I'm sure that's the main rep.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.400]   So not to change the subject too much,
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.520]   but Googles, Eric Schmidt, and Apple's Steve Jobs
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.360]   were seen today, according to Gizmodo.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.960]   Look at these paparazzi shots,
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.560]   sold to Gizmodo for a mere million dollars,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   (laughing)
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.880]   I'm sure.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.080]   And this is today at a Palo Alto coffee shop.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.560]   There's no doubt that that's--
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.800]   - Is that black thing on the table and I've had a roof?
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.840]   - Well, that was the question.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.680]   It turns out-- - Oh, no, there was
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.200]   discussion about it. - It is not.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.520]   - It's a menu.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.280]   - It was, yes, this was yesterday, right?
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.840]   - Yesterday, no. - And it was a menu.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.080]   And then there was all this body language analysis.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.680]   - That's what I loved. - It got to work.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.520]   - That's what I loved.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.520]   Gizmodo brought in a body language expert to analyze it.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.000]   She looked at hundreds of shots of Schmidt and Jobs
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.280]   in different situations.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.960]   Her name is Janine Driver, former officer
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.000]   for Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.600]   Here's the best conclusion that she says in this,
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.080]   in this whole thing, Schmidt is obviously scared
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.240]   of Steve Jobs.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.840]   (laughing)
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   She says, "Because of their shoulders,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.920]   "there's no way to hide it.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.520]   "Schmidt is scared of Jobs.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   "He's rolling his shoulders forward
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.920]   "to make himself a smaller target.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.640]   "Something Janine Driver has seen in law enforcement
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.720]   "when criminals are around the police."
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.960]   Gizmodo said, "Well, is the table affecting
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   "how they're crossing their legs?"
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.040]   No.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.000]   I've been analyzing this for years.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.400]   There's no question in her mind
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.040]   that there is only 33% openness, she said.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.360]   That's only because when you're conversing with somebody
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.720]   you can't protect your neck.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.880]   - Well, I like the idea of Steve terrorizing Eric.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.720]   - I think it's hysterical.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   - I don't think that's going on.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   - It's hysterical.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.440]   - I mean, that is kind of a delightful idea,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.560]   but that seems a little far-fetched.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.400]   I mean, the point that they brought up
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.720]   was that these two met at a coffee shop outside,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.760]   like sitting outside.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.880]   I mean, it seemed like, you know,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.720]   an interesting choice of places to meet.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.680]   It was a neutral ground, but also, I mean,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.000]   did they not expect that folks were gonna snap photos of them?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.840]   - Well, Perr-- - And maybe I was,
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   you always wanted to say,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   "Okay, now that someone's taking their picture,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   "okay, we can leave now."
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.280]   - Well, apparently they were gathering a crowd.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.880]   (laughing)
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.680]   At one point, Schmidt says, or maybe Jobs says,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.120]   "Let's take this somewhere more private."
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.160]   So they go in.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.840]   But apparently, I mean, maybe they were just getting coffee.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.560]   Maybe it was just a coincidence.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.720]   - I can't believe that, you know.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.080]   Yeah, a coffee at Google is a bit of a pain,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.920]   you have to make it yourself,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.520]   but the coffee has great coffee.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.760]   So-- - And Mountain View's not that close.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.640]   - It's pretty serious stuff.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.040]   - Some things were overheard.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.160]   It sounded like Steve,
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.480]   well, here's one of the overheard quotes
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.280]   from Steve Jobs enthusiastically.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.560]   They're going to see it all eventually.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.160]   So who cares how they get it?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.600]   I don't know, naked pictures.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.360]   I don't know what he's talking about.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.200]   (laughing)
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.480]   And then let's go discuss this somewhere more private.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.520]   - I should, who traveled?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.200]   This was closer to whose headquarters?
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.800]   - This is Steve hangs out in Palo Alto.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.640]   He lives there.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.480]   - He lives in Palo Alto.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320]   - He has a house there.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.160]   - This was Eric traveling to Steve.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.960]   - It was Eric getting to his neighborhood, maybe, yeah?
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.800]   Where does Eric live?
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.640]   Does he live on one side?
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   - It's closer to Google than it is to Apple,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.480]   but it's close to Steve, yeah.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.360]   - Yeah, it's like right by his house.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.200]   He walks down this street all the time.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.040]   - What is in the town?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.880]   - Actually, no, it was in the town
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.120]   and country shopping center.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.960]   - Yeah.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.280]   - He has no reason to be there.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.000]   You think Steve Jobs goes to his shopping center?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.280]   (laughing)
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.000]   Or Eric Schmidt for that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.640]   Where's the limousines parking?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.520]   This was a meeting.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.360]   - What happened?
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.200]   This comes at a call.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.040]   I mean, this is what we have, right?
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.880]   These are celebrities.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.720]   - This is the--
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.000]   - Yeah, man's got to buy the turtle next somewhere.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.840]   - No, no, I think he has people to do that.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.200]   I swear to God, this is an intentional meeting.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.440]   There's no way Eric Schmidt and Steve Jobs
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.680]   show up at a coffee bar in a shopping mall
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.760]   without planning.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.000]   (laughing)
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.840]   You don't buy that, huh?
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.440]   - Go for it.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.800]   - All right, enough celebrity analysis.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.720]   - So it was planned.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   If it was planned, was it their effort to say
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   to the world, we're not really enemies?
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.520]   - Yeah, could be.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.080]   - Right, right, so it's--
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.920]   - This is the response
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.440]   to the New York Times article of last week's.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.280]   - Exactly.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.560]   - And apparently Steve, I mean, in fact,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.160]   the pictures are, he's like just stipulating,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.000]   which is Steve.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Obviously, Eric's like sitting there
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.320]   with his hands in his lap quietly.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.040]   - Just, just Eric.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   - Yes, yes, go ahead Steve, iPad, yes, I know, I know, I know.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.840]   Talk more about the iPad.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.440]   I would have loved it if Steve had an iPhone on the table
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.200]   and Eric had had a Nexus One on the table.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.040]   (laughing)
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.440]   - Aw, that would've been awesome.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.280]   - Measure.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.440]   In fact, in February, the numbers are out.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.720]   I don't want to steal your number, Jeff.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.280]   Is this one of your numbers?
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.120]   - I don't know, I don't know,
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.520]   I come up with a whole bunch of them, Leo.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.600]   - I hide them under rocks.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.960]   That's fine, don't go ahead.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.200]   - That the iPhone was outsold by the Nexus One in February.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.000]   I mean, that's not a huge surprise.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   The Nexus One is newer and, you know.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.640]   - As the story said,
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.160]   everybody who wants an iPhone has an iPhone, so.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.560]   - Nevertheless, I think that's still a big story.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.400]   - It's working, it's working.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.240]   It's gonna take off.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.560]   - And the Nexus One's gonna be on Sprint now and Verizon,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.800]   and it is now available for AT&T, unlike the iPhone.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.360]   - When is this right in Verizon happening?
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.600]   - No one knows, my sources said
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.400]   that it would be available on Verizon today,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   and I don't think that's that.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.800]   - Yeah, that's why I have been told in the March as well.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.640]   I think that they said that in Davos or something like that.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   - Yeah.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.480]   - But the case.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.320]   - And Sprint's very soon too.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   I think Sprint's an interesting play for.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.600]   - Is that Sprint's not a 4G phone though, right?
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.560]   That would be cool, I don't think it is.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.240]   That would be a leap ahead for Sprint.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.440]   - Sprint does have 4G.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.640]   - Yeah, yeah, Sprint has 4G.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.480]   That's the question.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.800]   - I should go with the iPhone as 4G or not.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.560]   - Right, if that they would make a 4G.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.400]   I suspect it's not 'cause I think they're gonna make
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.120]   the same phone for Verizon Sprint.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.880]   - Both on CDMA.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.720]   And of course Verizon's gonna use LTE, Sprint's gonna use
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.600]   YMAX for their 4G networks.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   So it seems like you'd have to put different chips in them.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.080]   - So speaking of Apple, while we're on that,
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.960]   I just saw, I think Mashable said that the ship date
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.880]   for the iPad has now moved April 12th.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.560]   - No, not exactly right.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.480]   Ship date's till April 3rd, but if you order today,
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.680]   you won't get it till April 12th.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.880]   In other words, they've sold out the first shipment.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.720]   - What's the difference?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.560]   That's what I mean, I've sold out.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.040]   And there were rumors varying anywhere from 300 to 500,000
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.760]   for the first manufacturing run.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.040]   And that's fairly close to the numbers that these bloggers
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.520]   who are counting serial numbers are coming up with.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.320]   That's pretty good for initial sell-through.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.400]   Pre-order.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.440]   - So you ordered how many of them?
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.280]   - Four.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.120]   - Four.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.880]   - You only get two, so I had a shill order two more for me.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.120]   For this show next week, I will either have one
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.360]   or it will arrive during the show.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.200]   (laughing)
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.040]   Wall Street.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   - Ooh, it's live unboxing.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   - This is my favorite metamol.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.400]   - Live unboxing.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   - Live unboxing of the iPad right here.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.840]   My favorite metamol is the Wall Street Journal
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.480]   reporting that sources close to the Wall Street Journal say.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.880]   (laughing)
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.720]   - Oh, no.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.440]   (laughing)
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.680]   You couldn't just say our sources.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.240]   - Either they got a great firewall
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.840]   or this is just a joke, but say that they walled.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.680]   - You should have.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.520]   - I love it.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.320]   Sources in the know tell us that like the guy sitting next to me.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.880]   - That the Wall Street Journal iPad application
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.680]   will be selling access to the journal for $17.99 a month,
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.760]   which is about the same as web-based access to the web.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.560]   - No, it's more than the web-based access.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.520]   That's yeah, it's which is what's absurd.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   - I thought the web was $175 a year.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.440]   - What are they gonna have?
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.680]   Dancing naked money?
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.520]   (laughing)
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.680]   You know, how do you make it worth more than the web?
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   - That's a good point.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.360]   - It's actually in finance.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.160]   Sports Illustrated pardon me, swimsuit edition.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.680]   Okay, I can understand the higher price
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.920]   in the marketplace.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.760]   - Oh, you haven't seen the Wall Street Journal swimsuit edition.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.080]   - But, geez, yeah.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.920]   (laughing)
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.880]   - How does that compare to the Wall Street Journal subscription
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.720]   on the Kindle?
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   - Kindle was, I think.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   - This is probably another, this is another note.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.800]   - 29.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.640]   - Is this another one of your numbers?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.960]   - No.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.800]   - 14.99.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.000]   - I just had a really boring number you'll never get to.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.840]   - Good, thank you.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.240]   - The Kindle Wall Street Journal Kindle, hold on.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.840]   - 14.99, it looks like.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.320]   - Yeah, I canceled it when the price went up.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.160]   - Mm.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.600]   - Yeah, I'm a paper subscriber
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.640]   and then I got a deal on the...
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.480]   - The 49.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.320]   - 14.99.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.160]   So is this a name?
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.000]   - So what is it for the iPhone 10?
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.080]   - 17.99, that's crazy.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.680]   - Interesting.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.960]   - You get the web version.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.160]   - Now, Andy and not co-told me
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.360]   that there are a few companies that have iPads now.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.480]   You know, one of the problems, if you're making iPad applications
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.720]   is you're developing an emulator.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.560]   - You'd like to...
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.680]   - Which is totally bogus.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   - You'd like to ship, but you'd like to ship day of, right?
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.400]   'Cause the store will be the smallest it'll ever be.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   And you have the best shot
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.160]   at getting the attention of your potential customers.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.720]   On the other hand, we don't know.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.880]   I mean, if there's a showstopper bug
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.360]   that you didn't notice until it actually ran on hardware,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.280]   how long for the update?
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.120]   It's an interesting...
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:43.960]   - It's really rapid to re-approve it.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.160]   - Yeah, you really risk a bad user experience.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.440]   - However, Apple has, according to Andy and not co-seeded,
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.800]   several companies, including The Journal,
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.120]   The New York Times and Electronic Arts with iPads.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.960]   So those companies...
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.880]   - I know that's the case from my sources
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.920]   in one of the publishing companies,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.680]   and they do have to be in a windowless room,
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.240]   bolted to a table.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.400]   (laughs)
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.320]   Wait a minute, serious.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.160]   - You're joking.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.120]   - Windowless room, guarded, locked, bolted to a table,
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.400]   so that you could not even pick them up
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.560]   when you work with them in that space.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.400]   - That's what Steve was expecting.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.240]   - Are you serious?
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.400]   - I don't blame you coming in.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.680]   - That's right, I mean, this is like,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.800]   replicating Apple conditions.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.600]   - Yeah, they're famous for this.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.720]   And when they're building new hardware,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.560]   I've had this when I was...
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.920]   - You know, you worked in Apple, yeah.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   - Yeah, it was like, okay,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.880]   we've got a bug on the P47,
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.160]   and then you have to go, and you say, what's that?
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.320]   And they say, I'm not telling you.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.880]   And you go into this, like, go into a testing lab
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.080]   that's inside the other testing lab
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.240]   with a separate card key door,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.040]   and then you have a monitor and a screen,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.960]   and there's something under a cloth,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.600]   and you sit there and wait till it crashes,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.320]   and you look at the debugger and you go,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.480]   ah, this is in my code,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.600]   or you go, that isn't in my code,
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   you need to talk to this other guy,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.240]   and they go, thank you, off you go.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.080]   - I mean, I know they're insane in house,
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.880]   but how can they enforce that insanity at the New York Times?
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.720]   - Oh, because they do.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.560]   - That's the whole thing.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.520]   - Since Scott Rosenberg wrote a wonderful piece
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.960]   about how this all reminds him,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.560]   it's all giving flashbacks to the days of CD-ROMs.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.360]   You know, tell me that, I saw that headline,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.880]   and I don't know, why does this remind him of CD-ROMs?
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.400]   - Because it is about this belief
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.960]   that this is gonna change everything that works.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.760]   Super cool now, we're gonna regain control.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.320]   It's my view of the whole iPad thing.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.160]   - Oh, you're right.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.720]   - Publishers, editors, and now advertisers.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.240]   And advertisers are buying ads on these things,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   but no audience proven.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.080]   - Right.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.920]   - Why?
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.360]   - Because they want to regain control.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.320]   And everybody thinks there's some gold rush to be had.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.720]   I found the number here, Wall Street Journal Web,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.280]   the entirety of the Wall Street Journal,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.800]   $8.62 a month, more than double that,
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.440]   to buy the dancing quarters on the iPad version.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.320]   What could it possibly be?
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.640]   Advertisers coming on.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.800]   Well, we're gonna now, you know,
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.960]   focus your attention on our ad and nothing else,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.000]   as if we're not gonna click off.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.520]   And that's what they see in this iPad,
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.640]   and that's what's, they're just fooling themselves.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.520]   So all these publishers think that this is their salvation.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.120]   So it'll do whatever Steve says.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.920]   'Cause finally, thank you, Steve.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.320]   You've given us back our control.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.560]   We will force people to go from page one to 100.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   And that's the way media should be.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.480]   Well, sorry.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.440]   - Yeah, they're watching that wide demo
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.760]   of their iPad thing.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.520]   I was completely having CD-ROM flashbacks.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   I was building CD-ROMs in the early 90s.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.920]   And creating these damn mock-ups
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.760]   and doing all this stuff.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.800]   And it's like, this is the kind of stuff
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.880]   that we ended up having to make for the publishers
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.040]   to try and persuade them to do this thing.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.960]   And the successful CD-ROMs,
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.800]   the ones that treated it as a platform for software,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.280]   like, you know, my 3D Atlas one that I built then,
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.960]   that ended up shipping two million copies or so,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.080]   did well because it was a way to deliver a software program
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.920]   that looked at the world and gave you interactivity.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.960]   It was kind of like a, not quite a Google Earth
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.000]   in that flavor.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.800]   Whereas most of these things were,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.440]   here's a bad way of presenting the stuff
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.560]   we've already got.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.480]   And of course, the web devowed them rapidly.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.880]   And the other half of that, looking at that demo was like,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.600]   where's, why is this special and new?
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.480]   This is, you can have video and audio and graphics
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.160]   and everything on web pages now.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.800]   You know, we've had this for the last 15, 20 years,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.440]   like 15 years.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.280]   We've been able to do this stuff.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.360]   We're now standardizing, so you can actually do it
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.040]   in HTML really easily.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   Why is this something you need to do
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.240]   a magic application for this?
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.840]   And the difference is, oh, we think we can put a price tag
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.880]   on this and people buy the application instead.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.360]   - So it's very retro.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   It's a very bad idea, it sounds like.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.760]   - It's still also part of, go ahead.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.440]   - Well, isn't necessarily a bad idea.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.320]   You know, there are some things you can do,
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.960]   but there's a whole bunch of production costs
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.120]   that come with that.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.080]   If you're gonna shoot video of every new story,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.240]   if you're gonna create infographics for everything,
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.120]   it's gonna cost you a lot of work to do that.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.960]   And you can do--
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.440]   - Isn't it truly worth the extra money to the customer?
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.840]   There's a reason, CP ROMs and books and magazines
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.040]   such didn't work, is because it wasn't worth that money.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.120]   - Well, I don't know if that's true.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.840]   It didn't work because it got replaced by the web.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.240]   - It will precisely get the web is open
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.960]   and the web is still open and then sort of go back
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.560]   to a enclosed world here.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.200]   - But it wasn't that the medium was bad.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.040]   It was just--
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.880]   - It was static.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.720]   - Or static.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.560]   - It was linked.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   - Yeah, it was static.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.400]   You're writing--
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.240]   - It was static.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.080]   - It was closed.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.920]   - Right, right.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.440]   - And so closed is the key word.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   Murdoch also announced yesterday that he's gonna put up
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.640]   a charge for the times and times of London
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.160]   and the Sunday times of London.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   One pound a day or two pounds a week and down goes the wall
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.840]   and I wrote a credibly snarky piece for The Guardian
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.120]   saying that this just shows that he's been defeated
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.960]   by the future.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.800]   It says his surrender.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.320]   He has no new ideas for advertising,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.720]   none for new rich relationships with readers,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.440]   none even he doesn't have new ideas for efficiency.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.040]   So he's gonna milk this cow a quid at a time
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.880]   and leave his children with the desiccated leftover beast
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.080]   of his once proud, if not great newspaper empire.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.800]   - Now, did you just write that in your head
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.640]   or did you write that?
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.480]   - Oh, it's settled.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.320]   - I love you.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.160]   - That was a great post.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.080]   - I gotta say, that is a good line.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.760]   I also said that I used to work for Murdoch at TV Guide
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.440]   and I did admire his balls, could he, they're gone.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.400]   (laughing)
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.480]   - Another good one.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.040]   - Oh yeah, I was, I was, I just, what the hell?
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.520]   I even appeared on Sky News,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.120]   which is of course controlled by Murdoch.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.960]   And when I got off the air, the producer said,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.520]   oh, I got a big stretch, I still have a job.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.360]   - Yeah.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.480]   - But that's what this is all about, right?
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.760]   It's publishers are looking for the means to bring back
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.320]   one last attempt, they're controlled
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.280]   and they've shrunk away from the world.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.800]   They're not looking for new opportunities.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.600]   They're not looking for new models.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.640]   They just wanna try to regain control and they won't.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.560]   - So is this Apple just trying to create
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.040]   and add their sort of interface UI magic to the web?
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.480]   Is this Apple just saying, hey, the web needs a better UI
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.840]   and we're gonna make it?
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.160]   - No, because there's a measure of control.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.280]   That's the question, Gina, it's exactly the question.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.640]   What do you think?
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.320]   - It's, it's, it's, you know, they've done that with,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.440]   with Safari and with the iPhone browser.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.120]   You know, that's their better UI for the web.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.720]   And they've actually moved the state of the art well
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.960]   forward a lot by shipping, you know, CSS and web,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.400]   HTML5 video and Canvas and all the other cool stuff
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.240]   you can do in there.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.960]   So they have done that and that, that's, that is great work.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.200]   But it's more that they're providing a platform
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   for you to do software development on that they have,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.280]   but they have a bigger stake in it.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.720]   I think that's the other half of it.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.440]   That they get to decide whether it's a good experience
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.240]   or not and that's, that's, that's very much in,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.600]   in, in Steve's head.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.640]   - So does this go back to though then an app based world
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.480]   closed at Apple open at Google Chrome, Chrome OS, etc.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.560]   Android and that, however that we start to move
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.320]   from a page based web in this vision to an app based web.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.680]   - I'm not sure that works, but I think that's what we start
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   to see a temp set here, no?
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.760]   - I think, you know, it's still gonna be a great web browser.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   This is, the, the, I said, it comes back to, you know,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.000]   - You don't, you don't lose the open desk.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.680]   - Well, don't do it.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.240]   - But you do if you're in the New York Times app.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.080]   - Right.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.680]   But that was the question you asked last week.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.640]   Jeff was, what's the difference between New York Times
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.320]   on the web, which works on the iPad,
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.360]   New York Times in the app, which works on the iPad.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.680]   - Except that I guess. - The blue Lego is the difference.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.480]   - The blue Lego flash.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.320]   - That's the difference.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.400]   - But if I'm the New York Times, I make sure that I don't,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.840]   you know, that I have a fallback position.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.120]   You know, we're in the same boat as a content creator.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.840]   We're creating an iPad app, but that doesn't mean
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.320]   we won't put absolutely everything still on the web
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   and you can take your choice.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.080]   - Right, but all I'm saying is the architecture changes
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.400]   in an important way.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.200]   If the, on my iPhone, the best way to read the New York Times
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.920]   is not the web, it is the app within the app.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.360]   - That's the New York Times choice.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.640]   They could make it. - That's fun.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.920]   But it's also, it takes advantage of the functionality.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.760]   But it does not give me then the power of the web.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.600]   - Right.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.920]   - It links me to other New York Times stuff.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.320]   It doesn't make it easy for me to search and link out
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.120]   to the web, which is true not just the New York Times,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.840]   but maybe, you know, all the news apps that I know
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.400]   of the Guardian too.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.200]   When you make an app, you're making a closed world again.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.600]   Even if you're not trying to close it,
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.640]   it just kind of becomes more closed because it's your app.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.800]   And you're not trying to build a whole browser.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.680]   And if you take the iPad, which, you know,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.480]   we'll only do one thing at a time,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.320]   and you're in the app to go out to the browser,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.080]   becomes a bigger investment, no?
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.440]   - Yeah, and I'm waiting for instance.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.160]   - Well, you end up embedding a browser within the app.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.000]   That's the other thing you do.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.840]   - That's kind of what we're doing.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.120]   - iPhone, iPad, you say, okay.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.960]   - That's the way to comment.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.680]   - Here's a little bit that is a browser,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.560]   and you can nab in there,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.280]   but you can nab to the science that I say you can nab.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.320]   - There is some limitations.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.800]   For instance, that's how we want to put streaming video
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.680]   in the iPhone app, but Apple won't let us do it via 3G,
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.240]   even though it works fine in Safari on 3G.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.760]   So they do have some control.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   They can say, well, okay, you can put a web browser in there,
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.640]   but you can't, for instance,
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.280]   stream video over 3G in that web browser.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.560]   Even though you, you know,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.000]   there's a very little technical difference
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.240]   between doing that and having the app go to launch Safari,
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.640]   then launch the link, then launch the QuickTime.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.480]   - Which it can do still, Leo, yes?
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.320]   - It does.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   That's how we do it, but Apple can say,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.720]   you're not allowed to do that.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.280]   So does the iPhone actually let you embed video in the browser?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.120]   'Cause the iPhone doesn't.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.200]   If you try and embed it, it pops it out.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.040]   - Right.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.840]   So in effect, what it does is it launches.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.120]   So for instance, and we want it to do that
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.840]   because if I were playing the video back within the app,
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.480]   I can't multitask, but if I'm playing it back within Safari,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.360]   here's another example of a completely artificial
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.720]   arbitrary limitation.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.240]   Safari will continue to stream the audio,
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.640]   QuickTime rather, so what happens
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.720]   since it goes from the app to Safari to QuickTime,
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   QuickTime launches, continues to stream the audio
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.160]   in the background, multitasking, because it's Apple.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.400]   - Because Apple is allowed to, yeah.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.240]   - Right.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.160]   So that's how we kind of allow you to listen to,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.520]   you can be listening to this audio
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.600]   and still be doing other stuff in your iPhone,
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.120]   but Apple gets to choose whether that's gonna be
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.200]   a behavior allowed in the app store.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.040]   And they just-- - Are you writing
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.680]   the same app in Android?
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.280]   - I don't think, I don't know, I don't think,
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.080]   Houdini Seven who does it from Shift-key Software
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.880]   is just a wonderful developer to listen or fan.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.760]   And I think he's only doing it for the iPad,
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   but we're certainly looking.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.040]   We'd love to have an Android version.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.880]   - It's tough already, it works for me.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.320]   - We can have an Android app.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.960]   - Well, you know what's interesting?
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.120]   The streaming video, so if you go to live.tuit.tv
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   and Safari on the iPhone, we can give you a click link
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.960]   playthrough that will give you a streaming video
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.040]   live on the iPhone.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.680]   It doesn't work on any other platform.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.040]   - Right, 'cause it's using that--
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.800]   - Pro-ch, Apple thing, yeah.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.520]   What's the Pro-ch, okay, that's not quite fair.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.000]   - It's using a standard-based thing that Apple has built
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.840]   that--
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.160]   - That only Apple can do.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.880]   - But it's not only Apple can do it, no, you can--
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.000]   - Nobody else has done it, friends.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.480]   I mean, absolutely Google could make it possible in Android,
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.320]   but we need them to do it, right?
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.800]   - Right, now if I do live on Twitter,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.240]   TV on A doesn't do anything, yeah.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.000]   - Yeah, it gives you an error, it throws an error,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.840]   'cause we're--
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.600]   - So you need Flash?
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   - No, does it?
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.440]   No, I don't think it does that.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.200]   It throws out a playlist, and it just says,
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.000]   I don't know what to do with this playlist,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.800]   but whereas Safari does, it will launch QuickTime
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.400]   and run it, and says you need Flash, yeah, there it is.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.680]   Oh, I know what that is, that's the user agent detection
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.320]   on the webpage.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.360]   We don't bother doing Android detection
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.920]   because there's no point.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.080]   If, when it does the, but we can keep you from seeing
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.400]   that Flash error message, what you'll get instead--
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.240]   - You can give it a bit free, right?
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.440]   - Yeah, I think the audio works, I think it's just--
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.040]   - I do Twitch.am, whatever, yeah?
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.520]   - Yeah, yeah, I think you should have no trouble with that.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.720]   That's an ice cast stream.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.120]   - Yeah, that works.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   - So we, so what happens, I think we did,
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.200]   I think obviously our designers changed the user agent
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.400]   detection because we didn't want to throw an error
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.800]   when you click that Play Live video link in Android.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.640]   So we just say, no, no, no, you can't do that.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.280]   We don't give you the mobile page,
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   but we give you the mobile page on the iPhone.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.520]   Anyway, boy, that was inside baseball.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.960]   (laughing)
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.400]   I'm just talking to the inventor of QuickTime,
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   so I thought I'd have a chance to ask him questions.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.160]   - But even talking, I can get him on.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.080]   - Implementer.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.920]   - What was your relationship to QuickTime?
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.600]   - I did implement live broadcasting in QuickTime
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.720]   and video capture for over 10.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.520]   - I believe I'm talking to the right man.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.960]   No question about it.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.400]   Hey, congratulations, Gina.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.440]   You're Think Tank app, the app that you're doing
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.480]   for an Eel's company.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.320]   - Expert Labs, yeah.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.360]   - Expert Labs is now a Google Summer of Code project.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.560]   - Yes, it is a Google Summer of Code project,
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.040]   which is very, very exciting.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.840]   So if you're a student, you can,
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.880]   we applied to be a mentoring organization
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.760]   and we got accepted, which means that students
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.720]   who wanna spend the summer contributing
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.560]   to an open source project and making even
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.600]   a little money doing it can apply.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.640]   And I'm gonna mentor, I think,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.600]   we definitely get one student.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.040]   I'm not sure if we get more than one,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.520]   but I'm gonna be doing kind mentoring
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.120]   the student one on one.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.040]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.400]   - What's the requirement for the students
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.280]   ask the dad of a developer student?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.440]   - It's all on the site.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.600]   - SOC, which is Summer of Code,
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.160]   G-H-O-P dot AppSpot dot com.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.760]   And you'll see all the different
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.400]   accepted projects there.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.560]   And then you can apply for the summer.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.840]   - And all the requirements for students are there.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.320]   I think they have to be 18.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.960]   I think they have to be enrolled
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   in a high school or university, I wanna say,
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.960]   but definitely check the site.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.800]   And you get community subsidized help in the coding.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.840]   In an open source project.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.960]   - Oh, you get a ton of stuff.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.600]   You get to be, you know, get to put Google
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.520]   on your resume, you know?
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.240]   - I mean, it's a really great.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.080]   - You get paid.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.240]   You get a stipend, don't you?
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.440]   - Yeah, I get help.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.080]   So it's a $5,500 stipend.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.880]   The student gets $5,000 and the organization gets 500.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.120]   Okay, so, and so there's a mentor.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.560]   You decide on what people in the organization
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.320]   are mentors that mentor the students.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.240]   And then there are like,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.520]   there's a midterm evaluation and a final evaluation.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.040]   And it goes through certain particular dates.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.080]   And students write code for the organization
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.400]   on the project and mentors, you know,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.360]   help them along getting experience,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.000]   contributing to the project and getting those things done.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.120]   So it's a win for everyone.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.400]   And I'm really, really excited to get this kind of help.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.720]   And actually we're in the part,
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.120]   the applications haven't opened yet officially,
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.920]   but we're in the kind of, yeah, Monday.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.840]   We're in the point of the process where students
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   are kind of checking out all the different projects,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.080]   which ones they want to work on.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.120]   And we've had an onslaught of students on our mailing list,
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.240]   making proposals of what they'd like to work on.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.960]   We have a list of items that we'd like students to work on,
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.400]   but we're also taking proposals from students
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.720]   to install Think Tank and have ideas.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.000]   I'm certainly open to new ideas.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.480]   And some great conversations have come out of it already.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.000]   So I'm really, really excited about that.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.440]   So if you want to spend the summer coding
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.960]   and work with us at Think Tank, definitely check it out.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.960]   Check out the socghop.appspot.com site
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.160]   or just, you know, it just Google Summer of Code.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.840]   - That's probably why they have such a ridiculous URL
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.000]   'cause they want you to Google it.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.840]   And maybe it's some sort of qualification.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.680]   - It's not huge, actually.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.400]   - I think Jake can do this.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.240]   - Yeah, so what's your obligation to mentor?
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.000]   - So I'm gonna do, basically my obligation
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.160]   is to help the student along.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.560]   So yeah, and we really, mentors get decide how to do that.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.440]   I'm gonna do a weekly one-on-one meeting
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.320]   and just kind of, you know, offering feedback
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.640]   and sort of guidance. - That's right.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.560]   - But the point of the mentor is to help students learn
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   how open-source projects work.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.920]   So I'm gonna encourage a student,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.760]   I'm not gonna hand hold.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   I'm gonna say to the student,
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.240]   if you have a question posted to the mailing list,
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.760]   that's how it works, or in the chat
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.560]   and kind of discuss it with the community
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.440]   and get good at sort of the open-source way,
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.200]   which is like everybody kind of puts their two cents in
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.400]   and it's sort of a very public process.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.240]   But I'm gonna be helping,
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.560]   I'm gonna be doing sort of one-on-one meetings
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.440]   with a student every week or two weeks
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.840]   just to check in and see how they're doing
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.200]   and offer guidance.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.360]   So I'm really excited about that.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.640]   It's good to get experience at open-source early on
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.120]   and I'm sure I'm gonna learn a whole lot too.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.480]   - So Nate, it's such a good program.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.320]   - It's great.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.160]   - So the first thing that's really cool does it.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.240]   Congratulations on being here.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.080]   - Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.920]   - Part of it.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.760]   - Thanks.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.600]   - Yeah, that's really neat.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   Now's the time when we do our Google tip tool in Numba.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.120]   Let's start with a tip from Gina Trapani.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.160]   - Sure.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.560]   So this tip is kind of a feature
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.600]   that's been around for a while,
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.000]   but there's some news this week about it.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.920]   So I wanted to point it out again.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.960]   It's in Gmail.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.280]   This is a really cool feature of Gmail.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.400]   I love this.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.880]   At the bottom of your Gmail inbox, when you're logged in,
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.720]   it will tell you when your last account activity was
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   and on that particular computer.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.240]   And if you click the details link,
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.320]   it will show you any other Gmail sessions that you've opened
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.840]   on any other computers or devices.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.160]   So on my Gmail list right now,
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.600]   I've got a couple of browsers.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.480]   I've got offline access.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   I've got my Nexus One is logged into Gmail.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.120]   So it tells you what, be careful, Leo,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.640]   because it shows IP addresses.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.480]   - Yeah.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.600]   What are they gonna do with that?
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.000]   (laughs)
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.480]   - So it tells you what IP addresses you're logged into
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.000]   and what kind of device, which is pretty neat.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.720]   And you can remotely sign out from a session.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.160]   So if you see a session, if you stay logged in a Gmail
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.800]   at work at the office and you get home and you realize,
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.320]   "Hey, I didn't wanna stay signed in.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.000]   "I don't want my coworker looking at my Gmail,"
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.800]   you can remotely sign out other sessions, which is neat.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.200]   And the reason why, and this, like I said,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   this has been around for a while,
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.280]   but the reason why I bring it up is because starting this week,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.480]   Google started to detect unusual patterns on the,
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.120]   the IP addresses that normally access your Gmail account.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.960]   If there's one that's unusual,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.040]   like if you're logged in and three places in the United States
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.680]   and then someone in Poland logs in and they detect
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.840]   that this sort of suspicious activity, quote unquote,
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.560]   when you, next time you look at your Gmail account,
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.400]   you'll get a red alert that says,
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.080]   someone logged into your account from Poland.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.160]   Now, a couple of life hacker readers said that they were
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.360]   remote, using remote access to get into their computer
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.760]   in New York, from Florida and got this message.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.840]   Like, you've got, you know, someone got to see your account
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.960]   from somewhere else and they were like,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.800]   what the heck?
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.640]   And it was their own.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.480]   It was fine.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.400]   - I'd rather get the message.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.240]   I'd rather get the message.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.080]   - Yeah, you'd rather get the message.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:40.920]   - Yeah.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.200]   - So it's pretty awesome now that they're offering,
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.360]   I mean, on one hand, you're like, wow,
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.920]   Google's really interacting with activity.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.440]   But, you know, it's automated and it's kind of analogous
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.600]   to when your credit card company sees a transaction
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.840]   that's a very large amount or a place that you know
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.640]   not normally shop and they give you a call.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.880]   This is kind of like Gmail's a way of doing that,
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.280]   telling you if someone's, if there's account access
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.120]   from somewhere.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.080]   - I never thought I'd say credit card things.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.480]   It's like, okay, your credit card was just used in France.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.320]   You rang me at home.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.520]   If I was in France, would this phone ring?
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.400]   (laughs)
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.240]   - So I need to fix that.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.080]   So I need to fix that in my phone layer
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.120]   so that my phone can ring in France when I'm there.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.440]   - By the way, a very important side tip to this
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.080]   is to associate your cell phone with your Google account
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.040]   'cause it's one of the best ways to recover the account
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.800]   if somebody steals your password.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.200]   And then make sure that your secondary email address
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   is valid, one that you use, you know,
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.000]   that's not a Hotmail account that you haven't accessed
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.400]   in two years.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.000]   Make sure that you have a valid secondary email address
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.240]   and also associating your phone number.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.480]   I mean, some people don't block the idea
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.640]   of giving Google their phone number,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.520]   but if you use a Google voice number.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.680]   - They already know it.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.520]   - They already know it.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.360]   - No, I did that.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.200]   It's really great.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.480]   There's somebody in France, 'cause I'm Laporte at gmail.com
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.800]   and there's somebody in France who's sure
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.920]   that they're Laporte at gmail.com
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.440]   and that periodically we'll get a flurry of,
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.360]   you know, in French, we've been asked to reset your password.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.160]   (laughs)
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.160]   - No, you may not do not reset my password.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.240]   - Speaking of Google watching you,
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.320]   we'll get to the number in a second,
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.400]   but I just saw this today,
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.160]   and maybe it's happened for a long time
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.400]   and I didn't know it.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.000]   I'm going to the Norwegian Media Festival soon
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.640]   and I was looking at hotels using Chrome browser.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.240]   And then I went to gmail and I got a whole bunch
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.520]   and there's no mention of Norwegian hotels there,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.240]   but I got Norwegian hotel ads there.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.720]   Is that-- - Wow.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.360]   That's sophisticated. - They announced that this week.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.280]   They said that they've got this thing called--
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.160]   - We know where you are.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.520]   - We know where you live.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.320]   - They're selling ads that follow the user around.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.560]   That was the point.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.960]   - That is, oh, okay.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.720]   - There was a release about that this week.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.560]   - Yes, there was.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.640]   - It's part of the interest tracking stuff.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.760]   So the interest tracking stuff that was there for a while
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.960]   where you can go and say,
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.360]   "I'm interested in ads about X, Y, and Z,
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.560]   "I'm not interested in that."
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.760]   This is kind of an extension of that.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.080]   So when you go to another Google property
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.240]   and you're logged in,
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.160]   or go to another site that serves ads from Google,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.080]   they may re-show you ads from earlier
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.680]   if they think that that's something you're interested in
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.360]   or if they think it's high value.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.200]   - I actually didn't find it creepy or anything
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.040]   because I was seeing the ads.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.480]   I just saw it said, "What are they doing here?"
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.320]   - Okay.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.160]   - Right.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.280]   - So, but everybody's actually announced
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.000]   that they called it funnel or something.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.840]   Wasn't that it?
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.680]   - Funnel.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.520]   (laughing)
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.760]   - Funnel?
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.000]   - You know, they should go along with a pastry metaphor
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.800]   and call it funnel cake.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.520]   And then everybody be happy.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.640]   'Cause what could be wrong with funnel cake?
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.560]   - With funnel cake. - Yeah.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.640]   - Search funnel, that was it.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.680]   - Search funnel.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.520]   That sounds--
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.640]   - Sounds like you're gonna be--
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.960]   - Yeah, sounds painful.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.800]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.120]   - Yeah.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.200]   - So, time for our number of the week with Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.040]   - Yeah, you gotta take it.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.960]   All right, Leo, you're screwed.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.800]   - Uh-uh.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.640]   - Middle-Oumus screwed.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.040]   - Oh no, do we lose?
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:47.880]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.480]   Just with the deadline passed,
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.320]   1,100 community responses.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.160]   - TechCrunch had reported more than 600
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.840]   and then as of 526 PM on the 26th.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.600]   1,100 community responses,
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.640]   194,000 responses from individuals.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.040]   This is the Google Community Fiber Initiative,
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.320]   the idea to wire five communities from 5 to 5,
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   from 50,000 to 500,000 in the US with fiber, gigabit fiber.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.480]   - This is worse than college applications.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   - It is.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.320]   It is.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   You have less chance.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.160]   - This strikes me.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.000]   - I know.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   - I know it's a company that can run fiber.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.160]   You wouldn't find it on the platform.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.560]   - I want fiber in Petaluma.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.000]   Can we get gigabit fiber from BT in Petaluma?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.200]   - We know how to do it.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.120]   - Yeah, but you're British.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:30.960]   - It's a big one.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.120]   - Is it a log across the pond?
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:34.960]   - Oh, no.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.040]   There's a bit of BT that lays the fiber for the UK
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.680]   and does not have the time to do.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.520]   - Okay.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.360]   - To the challenges.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.200]   - It's too much for free.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.040]   - And the reason Google's doing this
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.920]   is to make the point that at the moment
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.080]   it's stitched up by lots of local monopolies.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:46.920]   - Right.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.760]   - And much more so that in the US anyway,
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.560]   the copper companies have monopolies
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.840]   and have invested interest in amortizing the cost
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.760]   of installing the copper.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.320]   They don't want to put fiber in.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.760]   - But the other half of this is that
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.480]   generally there isn't open access in the US
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.320]   like there is in the UK.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.720]   In the UK, BT runs the fiber, sells it to themselves
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.120]   at the same price as somebody to everyone else
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.200]   and everyone can run services over the top of it.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.720]   Whereas here you have these vertically integrated monopolies
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.880]   and you get the right to do cable television in one city
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.040]   and that means you can knock other people out as well.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.320]   So the interesting thing for me,
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.160]   through my professional hat on,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.000]   is saying, well, hang on,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.560]   if these communities want this,
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.320]   can they work out a way of changing the bylaws
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.760]   and said that we can actually do this?
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.960]   Because, you know,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.880]   us and a bunch of other telcos would love to run fiber
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.400]   around the communities and do this stuff.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.320]   But at the moment, you tend to be locked out in the US.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.600]   - At the same time of Verizon Files,
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.160]   which I have and works wonderfully
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.600]   and far better than my cable company did,
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.160]   just said this week that they're going to basically
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.240]   run down their installation of it.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   In towns where they are, they'll finish,
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.040]   but they're not going to go in a new major market series.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.480]   - No, so that's it for us.
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.400]   - Very depressing.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   - And why was that?
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.560]   'Cause it's very expensive.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.400]   It's like 5,000 a sub or something.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.640]   - Well, it's hugely expensive
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.920]   and I watched them installing here,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.760]   was wildly expensive.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.520]   There were four guys going nuts all day.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.200]   They said that they had a goal of a certain number of subs
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.400]   and they're going to reach that goal
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.280]   and that's kind of it.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.320]   But I find that very depressing
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.280]   because I loved the competition.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.240]   And you can see that,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.960]   if you go to the Google official Google blog
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   and see the response on the Google fiber,
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.120]   they did little dots for governments.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.960]   And they did big dots for any area
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.880]   where more than 1,000 individuals reached them.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.720]   And it's interesting to see the popular appeals that came up.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.680]   - I wonder if I'm a big dot or a little dot.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.880]   - What's fascinating is I don't see much,
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.600]   I can't even be tell this,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.680]   Northern Canada has a big dot.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.920]   - But the East Coast and around Chicago, Michigan,
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.440]   huge clumps of activity.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.920]   - 1,100 competitors.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.760]   - Wow.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.240]   - And we're not a big dot.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.560]   - Well, you know, you know, many people.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.920]   - Yeah, we couldn't be a big dot.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.160]   There's only 50,000 people, it's a small community.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.480]   But so really what these dots should reflect
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.320]   is per capita participation.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.160]   - Of course, we're not going to be able to build
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.480]   in every interested community.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.360]   We put you on our wait list for a college admission.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.200]   (laughing)
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.280]   - Yeah, it's like being wait listed.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.080]   - Oh man, Jeff and I are both going,
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.160]   well, our kids are both going through that right now.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.400]   - So Kevin,
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.280]   - Rock University of Rochester, NYU,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.920]   George Washington University,
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.480]   Rensselaer, Bosch University.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.520]   Those are Jake's choices.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.360]   Any advice?
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.680]   - Okay.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   I don't know the US universities that were Rochester.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.120]   I know people believe that Rochester,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.720]   'cause Liz Lolly's there.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.120]   - Yeah, I was just saying Liz's there, yeah.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:48.960]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.320]   - There's Lolly's?
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   - And Liz Lolly, she was a guest on,
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.120]   she was talking to us about the game that she did
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.720]   with the newspaper there, yeah.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720]   - Right, right.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.040]   - So Ping her about Rochester
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.480]   and their programs there.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.360]   - I think it's a good tip.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   - Rochester's supposed to be fantastic.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.440]   I'm not gonna ask you about the schools
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.240]   that Abby's going to, none of them have a tech cut.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.080]   (laughing)
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.920]   - It's an angle at all.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.840]   - Oh, I'm here.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.040]   I need to learn this stuff.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   - Oh, you will be.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.720]   - I'm sitting in the box.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.280]   - I'm sitting in my kids back to you, okay,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.520]   in my hand, but I'm gonna work on it
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.840]   if that's actually possible.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.680]   - You learn by default, there's no choice.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.360]   - Well, so when does Google announce
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.240]   when who's gonna get it?
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.360]   - They didn't say it's end of the year or something,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.160]   I'm in like that, wasn't it?
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.440]   - Well, you weren't here, Kevin,
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.320]   but I brought in a member of the Petaluma City Council.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.200]   - I heard that, this is a last week show, yeah.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.880]   - A strong-armed Google.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.280]   (laughing)
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.520]   - Somebody was flying a plane round
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.720]   Google campus on Friday.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720]   - Oh, wow.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.800]   - So he was flying a plane saying,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.720]   will Google play in Peoria?
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.560]   (laughing)
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.120]   - That's really, that's tough, and I don't know.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.280]   But see, I'm thinking-- - I'm trying to get you to
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.440]   go down there, Leo, a bunch of little kids.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.480]   - Google's not gonna be influenced by the,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.320]   I'm thinking, not gonna be influenced
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.360]   by those kind of gimmicks.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.200]   - They're gonna come up
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.680]   with some mathematical forming for this.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.800]   - Exactly.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.640]   What's the algorithm?
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.040]   We're gonna do city rank, it's a new thing.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.240]   (laughing)
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240]   - Yes.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.560]   - City rank.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.160]   - So I've got a number for you.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.000]   - Oh, great.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.960]   - Oh, good.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.280]   - This is the Nexus one,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.360]   there's only 2,000 as many pixels as it says it has.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.160]   Do you see this article?
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.920]   - Yeah, and I don't, it's bogus.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.680]   And also it doesn't have as many color depth,
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.520]   as much color depth.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.000]   - It at work, so the thing is it has
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.480]   a different kind of pixel.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.680]   This is, this is a little geek out.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.560]   - Yeah.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.280]   - So-- - It's an ML ed screen.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.680]   - But it has these, it has little thin green pixels
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.600]   that it has as many as it says,
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.000]   but then each of them either has a big red
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.520]   or blue pixel next to it.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.440]   So it has as many green pixels as it says,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.840]   but it has far fewer red and blue ones,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.000]   which means that you lose overall color resolution,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.960]   which isn't that bad,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.720]   but it also means that stuff gets fuzzy
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.160]   when you get weird fringing effects.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.000]   And this guy asked him,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.280]   "Is this gorgeous thing where he,
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.880]   "what reverse-engineer the fringing effects
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.160]   "and will give you grayscale images
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.440]   "that show color on the Nexus one
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.080]   "and a grayscale everywhere else?"
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.920]   So this is--
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.440]   - Wow, that's interesting.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.520]   You know, I, and, you know, I saw that.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.200]   And of course everybody who was mad at me
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   for switching off the iPhone to the Nexus one,
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.320]   all the iPhone big, it sent me this article.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.160]   I got eight thousand clicks.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.720]   - I still have a way more pixels than the iPhone.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.240]   - Well, I got a ton of links like--
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.680]   - I've got a third as many pixels.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.400]   - I know, but the article was said--
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.880]   - It makes me happy for having the droid now,
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.720]   'cause my droid actually has got that many pixels.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.400]   And, you know, the Texas play on this is beautiful.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.920]   - Oh, he's very crisp, I really like it.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.080]   Although I haven't noticed, you know,
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.360]   this is the thing is you can give me all the numbers you want.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.240]   Just put an XS1 next to an iPhone
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.480]   and tell me which has a better screen.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.840]   I mean, it's just not even close.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.680]   And I agree, I think the droid has a gorgeous screen too.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.560]   - I found that I actually read text on this now
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.040]   because I read stuff here and I don't feel
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.480]   I need to go to the computer to read it properly,
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.560]   which is a big change.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.000]   - Right, we're seeing a lot more AMOLED screens coming out
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.520]   at CTIA, I think that's gonna be the screen of the future.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.240]   And I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple do one
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.680]   in the next generation iPhone.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.320]   If they ever release an X generation iPhone,
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.560]   they're kind of busy right now.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.080]   So my tool is an Android application
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.480]   that Google released this week called My Tracks.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.960]   And I thought you would really like this, Gina,
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.000]   'cause I know you're a cyclist.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.640]   Or at least you have cycles hanging on the wall.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.720]   - Yes.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.520]   - I don't know if you actually ever ride them.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.680]   - Yeah, I go in cycles.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.440]   If I have a good app, then yes.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.280]   - Well, this app you will--
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.160]   - As a motivator.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.920]   - You will like this app, it's a wonderful app.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.960]   It's called My Tracks.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.920]   And I just used it today for the first time.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.240]   It just came out on the Android phone.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.560]   And it uses the GPS built into the phone to track you.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.840]   And one of the advantages, I see you have it, Kevin,
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.520]   you've been tracking yourself.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.960]   - Yeah, this was me playing hockey.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.080]   - I was gonna say, what are you doing?
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.560]   Good Lord.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.440]   It's a random walk.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.160]   So that's how accurate it is, which is really cool.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.480]   - Focus, but you can see what's going on.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.680]   - Was that the default settings?
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.160]   Or did you have to turn the accuracy?
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.800]   - I turned it down to one meter to get that,
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.960]   but it defaults to five meter, every five meter.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.400]   But it's pretty impressive.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.800]   - It's really great.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.600]   And it takes advantage of the fact that you can multitask
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.560]   on the Android.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.880]   So you can be doing other things.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.720]   You can even turn off the phone and continues to track you,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.200]   which is one of the things the iPhone cannot do.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.840]   And another thing that's really great is there's social,
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.880]   there's a social side of this as well.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   So, I just did my walk to work, which is not that fancy,
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.000]   but you see this nice track here.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.720]   And then you can tweet it or Twitter it,
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.520]   or you can upload it to Google Maps,
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.600]   it becomes part of your iMaps.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.720]   So that's really handy.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:43.640]   So if I go to my Maps on Google,
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.480]   no, it's not here yet.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   Maybe it's not.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.120]   - There's a bit of a lag off to upload it.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.960]   - Yeah.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.440]   Oh, actually, you know what, it's on a different account.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   This is the--
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.960]   - Oh, yeah, this is that good, right?
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.800]   - Yeah, I have many Google accounts.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.920]   And the phone is using a different account.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.400]   Let me log into that other account.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.240]   But it's really cool.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.080]   So it uploads it.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.560]   You can share a link to other people.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.400]   You can have it, I mean, it's just,
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   it's a really nice little app and it worked beautifully.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.440]   And I've tried to, there are a number of other apps,
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.080]   sport tracking apps available on Google.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:16.920]   - There's one of mine, yeah.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.760]   - In the history.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.600]   - Stuck it in the chat.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.560]   - Oh good, okay.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.240]   - So yeah, no, this is, I like this.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.080]   It's very nice.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.920]   It's part of the sort of,
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.520]   you know, the self-monitoring thing,
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.080]   the idea of I'm keeping track of stuff,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.800]   I'm doing myself and it's,
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.880]   you're able to follow what you're doing yourself.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.480]   This was walking around the park over by Anderson Lake.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.320]   - Isn't that great?
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.480]   - It's just fun to know that, you know?
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.560]   I don't know what you can do with it.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   - But it's also actually really handy.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.120]   You know, if you're out wondering in the woods,
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.160]   you can then go back and look and go,
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.440]   where am I, where did I go?
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.640]   - Right.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.680]   - And you know, the mapping stuff is less good
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.840]   in out in the woods.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.360]   You don't have the trails and things,
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.200]   but you can actually see,
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.520]   oh, that's where I left the car, excellent.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.360]   - Right.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.400]   - So it's, and it doesn't need a net connection.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.240]   That's the other half of it.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.360]   Unlike Google Maps and the Avonalat stuff,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.560]   it doesn't need a net connection.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.400]   - Right.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.240]   - You won't see the map tiles,
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.600]   but we will still get your path there.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.280]   - Because your GPS is always working.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.120]   - The GPS is working, it's throwing it locally.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.960]   - Right.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.800]   - And it will up at the end.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.560]   It's a nice thing, it's a sort of nice self-monitoring thing.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.920]   - It also gives you your speed, you're, and you know--
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.880]   - It tells you how fast you're walking.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.720]   (laughing)
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.640]   - Yeah, there's something really compelling
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.600]   about the self-monitoring apps.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.440]   I really love that.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.560]   And I just love software that makes you wanna go outside.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.400]   - Yeah.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.240]   - Yeah.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.080]   - Oh, that's-- - Finds for software
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:27.920]   that gets you outside.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.760]   - Although I presume if you set the resolution high enough,
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.800]   you could watch yourself inside as well.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.640]   Wandering--
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.640]   - I think you could also tie this
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.800]   against the EveryBlock API.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.640]   - The GPS, I know.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.480]   - Just a super company.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.320]   - The GPS, find out.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.720]   - What's the EveryBlock API?
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.240]   - That's a company that gathers all kinds of local data.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.320]   So I think you could see what crimes occurred near your path.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.560]   - Yeah, the mashups on this will be fantastic.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.400]   - Yeah.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.240]   - And is this connected to latitude at all?
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.800]   - No. - No, no.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.040]   It's just a separate app, but it does,
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.360]   it makes KML files so you can put it into my maps
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.680]   and you can put it into anything else that you can't--
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.000]   - Or Google Earth or--
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.240]   - Google Earth or write your own positive,
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   you know, cameras not that hard.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.040]   - The other tracking apps I've used are not,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.760]   do not nearly have this resolution.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.840]   I mean, the fact that I can see that I crossed the street.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.160]   I jay-walked.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.600]   You know, you know, you can see where my neighbors
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.680]   stopped me on my walk in and I had to deviate
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.280]   to go talk to them.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.880]   I mean, that's really great stuff.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.720]   I just--
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.560]   - Even if the family search card would--
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.400]   - If the kid would go around around--
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.560]   So it is using the compass.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.360]   So it knows my orientation.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.200]   - Yeah.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.120]   - Ah.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:35.960]   - That's really neat.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.280]   - It's clever.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.120]   - Yeah, that's neat.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.800]   - The other half of that is this is exactly new.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.000]   Google knows exactly where you are.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.840]   If you're running latitude,
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.280]   this is where they know you aren't.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.120]   - Yeah.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.360]   Latitude's a problem because if you forget,
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.280]   you've got it on, people know, you know,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.680]   inch by inch.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.240]   It's the ultimate in stalking applications.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.040]   - I can see which bars you were in Austin.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.880]   - Yeah.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.240]   Whereas this at least is not public
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.000]   unless you explicitly make it public.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.840]   It's--
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.240]   - Don't worry, I walked by the McDonald's.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.160]   I didn't go in.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   I didn't order anything.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.000]   I walked by.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.840]   - Sure, sure.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   We know.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.320]   We know it all.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.400]   - Well, anyway, another nice Android app
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   is just makes this phone more and more desirable.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.640]   I have to say, really enjoyed it.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.240]   Now there's a, it's interesting
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.440]   'cause HTC has released the HTC Desire.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.360]   No carriers in the US yet, but you can buy it.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.280]   I think you'll be able to buy an unlocked version soon.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.320]   That is the Nexus One updated.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.680]   It's got an optical tracker
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.840]   and so the physical track ball there.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.480]   And it has HTC Sense on top of it.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.200]   And it is running 2.1.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.600]   So that's essentially the same phone.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.760]   But some improvements.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.800]   Maybe the Nexus Two.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.360]   - Yeah.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.560]   - Gina Trapani is working hard
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.320]   to make our government more open.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.280]   And you can help her in the Google Summer of Code.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280]   Make sure you check that out.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.200]   And of course go visit her blog at smarterware.org
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.520]   and buy her book now out in paper.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.080]   In actual dead tree.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.280]   - We're killing trees.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.200]   - In helping charity.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.040]   - Complete that out.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.880]   - What is the charity?
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.400]   I didn't know that.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.640]   - Yeah, we're at the print version
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.920]   where we're partnering with a charity here in San Diego
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.880]   who printed it for us
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.120]   and is who's doing fulfillment.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:06.960]   - Yeah.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.800]   - They're a charity that provides jobs
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.240]   for a developmentally disabled adult.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.200]   So when you buy a book,
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.440]   half the cost goes to this charity
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   and you're helping employ somebody in my community.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.040]   - That's right.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.880]   I forgot.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.520]   It's the three waves or whatever their name was.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.360]   - Three ones.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.200]   - Three ones.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   - Three bones.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.560]   Bones with the ones and the things.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.960]   - Completewaveguide.com.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.800]   And we're not, lots of people buying the ebook
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.880]   and I really appreciate that.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.680]   But please kill some more trees.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   Buy some more of the print.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.160]   (laughing)
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.280]   It's in color.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.200]   - It's in color.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.320]   - It's a San Francisco tree.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.160]   - I'm sure.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.480]   It's a color paperback.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480]   - Isn't the PDF color?
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.320]   - Well, sure.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.200]   (laughing)
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.040]   - I'm sorry.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.680]   I didn't mean to ruin your marketing pitch
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.480]   but you should have made the PDF black and white.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.720]   - Yeah, I should have.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   I should have been retrospect.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.560]   I should have said that.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.640]   - Completely reversed.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.400]   (laughing)
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.320]   - You can hold it in your hand.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.160]   It's a thing.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.000]   - It's right.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.320]   - Like the better than the iPad.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.200]   - The more socially responsible than the iPad.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.040]   - Yep.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.360]   - Of course, a single app but.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.240]   - We didn't mention that.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.920]   And I know you bookmarked that.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.120]   The Wave file format, it was released today.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:07.960]   Yeah?
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.800]   - Yes, literally as we started talking.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.920]   - So, what does that change,
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.760]   Gina, for your book?
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.920]   I mean, you have to rewrite the whole thing now.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.080]   - No, well, you know, the book is really for users.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.440]   Much less for developers than users.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.040]   But yeah, no, this is exciting.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.840]   You know, they're ramping up for Google I/O
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.920]   which is in May.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.440]   I think there's gonna be some wave action at Google I/O.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.320]   So this makes sense but this is great
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.880]   that the Wave document model has been released.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.720]   That's great because that means we're gonna be,
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.160]   we're gonna have more printing options.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.040]   We're gonna have a little more options
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.000]   for what you can do with Waves
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.360]   which right now are kind of limited.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.960]   - So third parties can come along and do some stuff.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.800]   - Yes.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.240]   - I mean, I still think that's the weakest part of Wave.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.720]   They should throw out their document model
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.160]   and use an HTML subset because.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.000]   - I completely agree.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.960]   - It's a annoying XML format we gotta learn.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   - Yeah.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.640]   Who needs that?
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.480]   - Yeah.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.320]   - Yep.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.640]   - But I've argued with them before
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.000]   and they haven't listened to.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.600]   - They won't listen to you, Kevin.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.600]   - Neil wrote that great post when they published it.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.440]   - Right.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.840]   - About Google should be using Open Standards for this.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.360]   And he was sort of half right in that the dynamic update stuff
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.120]   is not something that anyone else had done
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.080]   in an open way before.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.800]   So that needs to be there.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.200]   But the actual document format
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.720]   and the transform from the document format to the screen
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.720]   is this entire chain that was basically built on
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.400]   what GWT does and now they're sort of reverse engineering
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.560]   that and documenting it as opposed to saying,
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.000]   oh, we should just use HTML for this
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.360]   which would have gotten a lot more traction, I think.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.600]   - Mm, yeah.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.440]   - Still.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.120]   - Yep.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.640]   - But I recommend HTML everywhere so that we discount that.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.480]   Tends to work.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.720]   - That's just works.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.400]   Kevin Marks, of course, is it Ribbit.com?
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.200]   If you want to know more,
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.120]   part of the British Telecom family is a VoIP plugin
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.960]   that is available on Nwave as a matter of fact.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.800]   - It is.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.400]   - And everywhere else.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.480]   - Well, it's a general API for doing telephony on the web.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.080]   So if you're thinking about building web apps
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.880]   that involve any kind of telephony,
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.920]   then have a look at Ribbit because it can do it.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.880]   One of the things we just done with it recently is we've
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.040]   got an app called Idle Fanatic,
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.360]   which if you follow American Idle,
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.920]   this dials the phone for you so you can vote.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.520]   (laughing)
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.760]   - So you just say, who do you want to vote for
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.600]   and you press the button?
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.360]   - You just fill in the votes and then when the lines open,
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.400]   it just dials all the voting for you to save you.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.640]   - That's the constitutional, Kevin.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.040]   - Ooh, we checked that it's actually your phone number first.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.160]   We validate the phone.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.040]   So it's within the rules of the American Idle voting process.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   - It's actually a fascinating approach to a VoIP.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.800]   It's like a really interesting addition
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.520]   to the idea of VoIP.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.360]   - Well, yeah, the point is it's not just voice over IP,
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360]   it's telephony over IP.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.200]   - Right.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.440]   - Right.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.960]   - That means you can do lots of stuff with this.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.520]   So suddenly this stuff becomes programmable
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.640]   and you can find fun things to do with it.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.400]   And that's, we're so used to telephony being annoying.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.760]   Lady Gaga just did this great song about how annoying
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.800]   telephony is.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.320]   That's obviously enormously popular.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.080]   But actually if you start saying,
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.480]   well, how can we make this less annoying
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.080]   and make it part of the web?
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.000]   Then that's the point of Ribbit.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.960]   The point is to say, okay, we have an API.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.040]   You want to do something that involves
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.280]   this annoying phone system.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.360]   We'll make the annoying part go away
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.000]   and you can just make a call or send a text
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.480]   or whatever it is you want to do.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.200]   - I could have been in your number two, Jeff.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.920]   Lady Gaga became the first YouTube poster
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.720]   to reach more than a billion views.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.320]   And it was just the first three videos.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.920]   It didn't even include telephone.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:29.920]   - Yeah.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.760]   - Yeah.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.680]   (laughs)
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.520]   - It's amazing.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.360]   - Yeah, the whole video.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.200]   - Yeah.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.520]   Jeff Jarvis is at SmarterWare.org.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   That's his blog and of course--
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.680]   - Oh, no, I don't, I don't--
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.560]   - I mean, buzzerware.org.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.720]   I mean, underwear.org.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.560]   What is it?
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.400]   - Underwear--
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.240]   - Underwear--
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.240]   - No, buzzmachine.com, I'm sorry.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   - I was speaking of underwear.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.400]   I saw an ad on my Tweety client this week for Man Packs.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.040]   And the idea is that if you hate,
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.320]   men hate shopping for underwear.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.240]   So you can subscribe to underwear.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.800]   - Oh, I need that.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.000]   - My tweet was that I wonder if more people
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.800]   will subscribe to underwear than the New York Times
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.440]   or the Wall Street Journal in the future.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.240]   - So it's like fresh underwear shipments every few months?
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.640]   Is that the idea?
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.040]   - Stay fresh, stay clean, get a subscription service
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.560]   for your socks, t-shirts, and underwear.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.400]   Deliver to your door every three months.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.240]   - You man.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   - They wanted to trade a man pack, which--
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.080]   - What one?
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.520]   - But that's a little bit for my book.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.080]   And the problem is there are only hings
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.680]   and I said I'm the Bongbaius boss brand myself.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.520]   - Oh.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.520]   - Oh, Hugo.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.880]   - I think I'm wearing hings right now.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.200]   - There you go, Leo.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.640]   Some man packs for you.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.920]   - Let's see, you got your macho pack, which is $33.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.360]   Three underwear, three shirts, and three free pairs of socks
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.720]   every three months.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.840]   - And for this, these guys have to sponsor us.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.400]   You're gonna have to read a man pack commercial next week.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.640]   - I could do with this to stop my son's pinching mind.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.080]   (laughing)
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.600]   - It's really a bad thing when your kids get to your size,
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.160]   'cause then they just start taking your stuff.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   So I get, oh look, I can have White Haines Classic Breeze.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.000]   (laughing)
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.680]   - I'm trying to be married to someone of the same gender
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.200]   who also wears your size.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.600]   - Oh yeah, forget about it.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.400]   But see, you only shop once, wear twice.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.800]   - Exactly.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800]   - Sometimes you get the same taste, that works.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.640]   - Yeah.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.840]   (laughing)
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.920]   - I'm liking this.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.880]   I am liking this.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.240]   I'm signing up right now.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.480]   (laughing)
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.760]   I think that's the most useful tip in the entire show.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.560]   Man packs.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.400]   Jeff Jarvis is also the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.520]   You must get it right now in the better bookstores.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.640]   Everywhere and now he must go to pizza night.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   We are talking about changing the time,
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.400]   the regular time of the show.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.000]   And we would love to hear your opinions.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.280]   We believe we're gonna start doing it Wednesday afternoons
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.640]   to accommodate everybody's schedule.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   When's early evening for those on the East Coast,
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.400]   Wednesday afternoon for those on the West Coast.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.800]   But that won't happen for a few more weeks.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.360]   And we'll give you plenty of notice when that happens.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.400]   You can watch the show live, as I mentioned,
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.080]   at live.twit.tv.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   Every Saturday at about 215 Pacific 515 Eastern
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.240]   at live.twit.tv subscribe to the show
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   at Twit.tv/twig.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.640]   You'll see subscription features for Zoom,
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.920]   the Zoom marketplace as well as the iTunes store.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.760]   - More fun than subscribing to underwear.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.560]   - Well, maybe not as useful, but certainly more entertaining.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.920]   And we do do video now.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.040]   So you can subscribe.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.680]   I don't know if we're subscribing to the,
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.800]   I think you can subscribe to the video on iTunes,
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.000]   but you can also of course get it at youtube.com/twit
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.640]   in the Twig channel if that's not too damn confusing.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.480]   Thank you for joining us.
