[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.520]   Talking about the Google and the cloud and the Google
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.560]  verse, joining us as always.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.880]   Now from his home, not from his office.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.120]   Jeff Jarvis, hi, Jeff.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.320]   Stay at home today.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.920]   Yes.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.440]   You stayed at home to download OS 10 Lion.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.940]   Go on.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.680]   I wanted to hear first from you, Leo, how it is.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   It's different.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   We'll talk about it in a bit.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.960]   Joining us also, Nili Patel, who has some big announcements
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   to make about what really is his next.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.600]   Nili, former editor from Engadget Magazine, author,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.160]   at thisismynex.com, and soon to be the Verge.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.880]   The Verge.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.920]   We're very excited about it.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.840]   It's on the Verge.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.040]   Actually, we had to--
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.560]   I just came from the office because I'm
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.920]   worried that everybody there is downloading Lion.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.280]   And they would have killed this connection.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.920]   I actually love this shot.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.320]   I came home to do this.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   I love this.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.400]   You've got the red clock in the corner.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.600]   You've got the map of Chicago.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.040]   Did you plan that?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.560]   No, this is my little twit set that I have.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   I love it.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   I have the cover of our house.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   Do it.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.160]   The only thing you can't see is the bar over here,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.240]   which I can just reach to, surreptitiously.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.740]   Right.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.160]   Well, the show is on.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.320]   I too have a bar in my desk.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.480]   And it's always a good idea.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   Also, for the first time joining us,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.600]   really glad to have him.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   Ed Dumble, Ed is from O'Reilly Media.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.520]   He shares Oskan, which is O'Reilly's open source
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.200]   convention coming.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.160]   Is that next week?
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.720]   That's next week in Portland.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.220]   Wow.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.040]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640]   It's great to see the cottage before it disappears.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.760]   Kind of the last time.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.400]   It's kind of a poignant moment.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.040]   He's also a big data guy.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.920]   He's the conference chair of the Strata Conference
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.000]   that O'Reilly does.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.640]   And you'll find him on O'Reilly at radar.arReilly.com.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.000]   In fact, one of the reasons you're here,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.360]   besides the fact that you're so close by,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.200]   I had to have you come over before it's over,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   you wrote a great book, a book's length article on Google
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.240]   Plus and why it's not just another Facebook.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.200]   And we'll talk about that in a bit as well.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.600]   But as you mentioned, this is the last twig show from the cottage.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   We will be moving next door to the red trick,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.280]   twit, red brick house.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   And yeah, you're waving by.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.320]   Bye, bye, bye.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   On Sunday for Twit.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.680]   And then by the time we reconvene this show on Wednesday,
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   next week, all the bugs will be worked out.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.480]   [LAUGHING]
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.880]   OK, we'll see.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.480]   We shall see.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.640]   We'll be coming in on dial-up, I know.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.200]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   You won't believe it.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.960]   You've got to come out, Jeff and see.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.520]   I have an amazing team I posted, actually.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   And I hope-- John, you don't mind
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.400]   that I posted your email on Google Plus publicly to a million
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.800]   people, do you?
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.160]   OK.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.360]   John Slanina, who's our studio manager,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.240]   has been writing daily emails about what happened today
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.920]   in the new studio.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   And he wrote me one this morning.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.080]   I got his email.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.440]   And it was just so cool with pictures.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   And these guys are working till midnight and after.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.680]   And he said, we should be paying you to have this much fun
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.520]   playing with all this new gear.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.760]   We're getting training and all sorts of stuff.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.360]   It's really exciting.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.080]   But anyway, I don't want to go on and on about that.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.200]   But this is a lot of fun.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   So let us-- I guess we should tip of the hat
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   to the other guys.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.160]   Apple had a busy day.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   Actually, yesterday, a very busy day with a big earnings call.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   Huge amount of profit.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880]   They've got $79 billion in the bag.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.520]   Yeah, they're doing all right, that Apple.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.160]   They're not a lot of problems.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.080]   No.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.520]   No.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   Technology's been very, very good to them.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.680]   They're shipping new MacBook Airs, which looks sweet.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.800]   The new Mac Minis, which looks sweet.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320]   They're killing the plastic MacBook,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.640]   except for everybody in education.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.520]   But most importantly, I think for most of us,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.640]   they're doing lion.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.960]   You know, I asked them actually about that white plastic MacBook
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.800]   and what they were going to do for back to school.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.440]   And they're pretty high on the idea
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   that people don't actually need that much storage.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.600]   And that the 64 gig MacBook Air would be kind of fine
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.400]   for most people.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200]   You only really take-- most people only really
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   take a handful of pictures.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.200]   And they only download so much music.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.120]   I think that's crazy.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   Well, once iCloud-- I mean, really what it is is they're saying,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   you do have data, but you don't have it on your computer, right?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.680]   I mean, once iCloud comes out, we'll all store it on iCloud.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.080]   Right.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.560]   Or on Google+, or something.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.280]   I'm trying to stay relevant.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.920]   Well, it is relevant.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.240]   This show is not just Google.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   It's the cloud.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.800]   And I think that this is a cloudy operating system.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.200]   So they're going to put pressure on Comcast not
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.040]   to cut people off when they upload all this stuff.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.640]   Yeah, well, there's that guy in Seattle, isn't there?
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.680]   He used Carbonite to back up everything.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   He has two roommates.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.040]   But they're using Netflix.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.560]   They're using iTunes.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   He said him-- he admitted a little bit of bit torrent
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.880]   on the side.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.160]   But the thing that killed him finally
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520]   was that he uploaded all his music to Amazon's cloud.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.720]   Right.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   And he didn't get that upstream actually
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.560]   counted for his bandwidth limit.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.280]   250 gigs, he used one month, and then the second month,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.480]   and the third month, Comcast said,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.400]   you're out, no more internet for you for a year.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.120]   Yeah, that's insane, I have to say.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.320]   That's super crazy.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.800]   Well, get ready because I think this is the war.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.960]   The war begins now.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.760]   Well, it's funny, especially on a Google show.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.920]   For the longest time, Google would
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   argue that bandwidth, even mobile bandwidth,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.880]   should be regulated as an essential utility, which
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.280]   is what Andre, who's the guy in Seattle.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.760]   I mean, that's what he's arguing as well.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.040]   That's what I would argue.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.280]   And ever since Google really started promoting Android
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.480]   and being in bed with Verizon, I think a lot of their changes
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.920]   came, they've backed off of that.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.240]   And I think they still make that argument for wired broadband.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.480]   But they don't make it as emphatically for mobile.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.560]   And I think mobile is where the real action is going to be.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   I have friends here in Brooklyn,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.320]   and we only have time Warner for most people here in Brooklyn.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.920]   And they all want to get LTE modems.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   But the 5G cap kills them.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.680]   It kills that idea dead.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.720]   It's because Verizon wants them to clamor for Fios installations.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.920]   Can I be a devil's advocate here?
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.000]   Because I agree with you.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.320]   In fact, I think it's even better than you say, Neela.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.280]   It's not even a utility because water and electricity
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.800]   have to be created.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.560]   But bits are infinite, do not have to be created.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.040]   They flow freely without any constraint.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.560]   Wow.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.280]   It's not a-- no, it is a bottomless pit.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.360]   I have a good friend who's an R-I-S-P at the new brick house,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.600]   the AsonicNet.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.640]   And his attitude is, use all you want.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.240]   We'll make more.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.080]   He says-- and I talked about him this with him,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.960]   because it's my opinion.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.640]   The expense of it, of course, is the switchers, the routers.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.080]   It's a one-time-only capital expense.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.640]   But at that point, bandwidth is very cheap.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.160]   We are in this way, Leo.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.760]   Let me try this on you.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.400]   Bits are speech.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.320]   Yes.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.400]   And they're information, fundamentally.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.960]   And at some point, we have to come to a view in society
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.800]   that's a right, not a privilege.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.360]   And yes, there's an issue of pain for them,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.800]   same way there is pain for a newspaper or whatever.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.320]   But the notion that you could cut somebody off,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.720]   slow them down such that you cut them off,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   becomes, in the view of many now, a violation of a human right.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.280]   And if you read too much, we're going to stop you?
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.320]   No, good point.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.800]   But there is economics in this.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.560]   And this is the point Neil I was making.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.440]   And I agree that there is economics in it.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   The economics are not a big issue in land, internet.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   And absolutely, in that case, I think free speech
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.360]   of Trump, whatever economics there are.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.880]   But I hate putting myself in this position.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.720]   But to play devil's advocate, it is true--
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.880]   That's for the devil, Leo.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.360]   I can tell.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.320]   Well, it is true that wireless is a little different.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.480]   Because-- For now, but also--
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   For now.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   Strategically important, if Finland came around and said,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.640]   everyone in the country is going to have broadband wireless
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.520]   tomorrow, because they're going to have a right to have broadband
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.200]   connections, they're going to advance farther and faster
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.960]   than we are and make up for that Nokia problem.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.160]   So who should pay for the fact that Verizon is expensive for ATT
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.280]   and Verizon and so forth to backhaul data to each and every cell
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.480]   site?
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.640]   Because that's what they have to do.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.560]   In fact, you come back to the argument about interstate highways.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.360]   And another model here is that--
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.480]   And this is not going to happen in the current political environment.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.760]   But the government would pay for this to be done
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.960]   and hire private enterprise to do it.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.760]   But that the government would then have a role in saying how it operates.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.560]   That's OK with me.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   But you have to have an economic solution.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   And this is my only point, is that it's very expensive.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.560]   It's cheap to get landline data.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.280]   It's very expensive to get data to these cell sites.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.920]   Well, you don't just like the dark fiber.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.360]   The economics are inverted because the last mile is very expensive
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.320]   for landline.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.200]   It's very cheap for mobile.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.360]   So there's a balance.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.520]   Have you read--
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.560]   if you talk to Tim Wu, he wrote the master switch.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.040]   I mean, he makes--
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.440]   We got a lot.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.840]   --these arguments a lot.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.200]   Everybody can still read it.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.760]   It's a great book.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.120]   But instead of saying the government will pay for it,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.560]   one of the things you can do is say, well, you have a de facto monopoly.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.640]   You're AT&T.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.920]   So that's fine.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.000]   We're not going to regulate your monopoly.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.880]   And so you can't have it.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.720]   But because you do have a monopoly,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   we can say you have to act according to certain conditions
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.360]   that we set.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.600]   And that's actually one of the reasons why I'm very cynically
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.520]   in favor of the T-Mobile acquisition.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.040]   Because once you do have two enormous companies that
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.520]   own 80% of the subscribers, wireless subscribers in the US,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.080]   the government is empowered to say, well, at this point,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.800]   the market has failed.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.840]   The free market has failed.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.400]   Oh, Verizon, you're going to buy Sprint.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.080]   That's your next move.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.160]   We all know it.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.440]   Let's cut to the chase.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.880]   AT&T and Verizon, you have to interoperate.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.080]   And you have to establish that neutrality,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.480]   or whatever you want to call it.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.240]   Look how well that's worked with the monopoly called cable.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.400]   But I think that's actually the real argument, right?
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   Because the cable monopolies have failed the consumer over and over again.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.040]   Right.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.680]   So it's time to re-regulate cable.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.840]   And I agree with you and regulate the wireless.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.760]   But that doesn't seem like the direction we're heading.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.920]   Or a far far way to truly have competition.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.160]   But I think the question is, where do you want the competition?
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.520]   Right.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   Because you can only have it in so many places.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.320]   If you have it at the access layer,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.200]   you have to let the competitors monetize the access layer any way they want,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.360]   which includes controlling what goes to the pipe.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   They have to be able to tax the pipe.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.960]   I think for us, what we want is--
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.840]   I mean, I'm a content creator, right?
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.000]   I publish on the internet.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.080]   So I'm taking my bias for what it is.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.000]   But I want competition at the content layer.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   I want access to be ubiquitous, cheap, free, good, whatever.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.720]   And so I can go out there and I can compete against Leo on video.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.760]   And I can compete against MSNBC, Unnews, and all this other stuff.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.080]   Because that's where I want-- I think that's
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.520]   where the competition is vital.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.320]   At the access layer, there's only a handful of companies
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.240]   that will ever be able to effectively compete.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   And the barriers eventually are still high there.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.080]   But I'm going to use the British Model Eli.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.480]   The British Model is the--
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.160]   Unbundling.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.520]   Right.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.720]   There's pipes in and you have a right to access to those pipes
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.040]   to offer better services.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.600]   And the government does the pipe?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.000]   Who does the infrastructure?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   BT, BT does the British Silicon.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.640]   And that's a government entity.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.280]   I'm waiting to go to the show.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.760]   It's my friend, Chad Munn, who is our video producer.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.880]   This is my next and espionage in the Verge,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.240]   who went and made that documentary with Rick Carr in England.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   It was actually on Engadget.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.800]   It was on PBS.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.880]   It's really great.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   You can go watch it.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.960]   It's all about unbundling and how the British Model and the European
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.840]   Model is different and has resulted in faster speeds,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   lower prices, all this stuff.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.880]   And what they came back-- one of the lessons
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.440]   when I was talking about it, they're like, well,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.200]   people there are more willing to let the government go
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.600]   and regulate things and say, to private companies,
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.800]   this isn't working.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.000]   Here's what you have to do.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.960]   And I think you're right.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.280]   I think the political climate United
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   States is not ready for that.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880]   They can't raise the debt limit.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.520]   I don't think they can go until AT&T.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.360]   They have to open up their pipes.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.920]   AT&T.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.200]   They do that.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.760]   They're going to pay for it.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.280]   Right.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.880]   Go ahead, Dan.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.280]   So AT&T have just about ducked out of the race.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.520]   Anyway, the CEO saying that DSL infrastructure was
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.200]   obsolete the other day.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.040]   Well, they-- yeah, of course, because they and Verizon
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.920]   and all these other guys would like to go to the un-net neutrality
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.440]   wireless and abandon the landlines, which actually is an opening.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.240]   And this is the argument that-- oh, what's his name made?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.160]   This is an opportunity, really, because as these companies abandon
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.600]   their copper for fiber and mostly for wireless,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.440]   it's an opportunity for civil governments, civic governments,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.720]   to come in and take them over and do exactly what you're talking
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.800]   about.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.680]   And it is in the societal interest.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.880]   There's no question about that.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.680]   I just don't know where the money is going to come from.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.400]   We can't fill potholes in Petaluma, let alone wire every house.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.120]   Well, but it was a huge culture show coming over.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   Was it?
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Because I left behind my fast DSL for a star.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.120]   No 20 megabits anymore.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.840]   And the roads?
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   They're incredible.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.440]   And our taxes are so much lower.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.040]   No, they're not.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.160]   I think it's about the same.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   It is exactly the same.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   Like, several tax burdens about the same in the US
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.520]   as it was in the UK.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.160]   That's the guy we're--
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.480]   I can say the political climate in the quit IRC chat room
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   is like super hilarious, too.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.480]   I mean, people don't trust our government.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:43.920]   It's like a--
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.760]   That's very American.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.280]   You know, it's like they don't--
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.480]   the government is just us.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.360]   At the end of the day, right?
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:49.760]   I mean, it's--
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.280]   I'm with you.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:50.840]   It's America.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.520]   It's like it's us.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.360]   It's the existing--
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.200]   It's a solved problem.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.240]   You like it.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   It's collective action.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.080]   And whether or not it's effective at doing that
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.200]   is the problem.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.280]   But the idea of the government solving collective action
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.280]   problems is in and of itself why we have a government.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.560]   So that's-- and I completely hijacked this show.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.400]   No, I love it.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.920]   Go ahead.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.680]   Go ahead, Jim.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.240]   Go ahead, Jim.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.600]   The libertarians will come storming us any second.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.160]   But I think that's part of what we've seen with the Murdoch
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.640]   situation is that there is an institutional coziness
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   that has gone to an extreme now, that government and media
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.320]   and police and large corporations--
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.920]   you know, I don't mean to sound like I'm
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   moving to the Kremlin because I'm not.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.120]   But no, the government isn't us right now.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.920]   The government isn't even open with us.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   No, actually, you have a good point.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.560]   So now what do we do?
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.680]   Well, I--
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   We throw the bastards out.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   Is that the solution?
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.960]   Well, if you can't, but I think that there
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.240]   are some solutions in transparency and technology.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.400]   They aren't full solutions.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.760]   And no, I'm not doing my little riding hood going
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.320]   through the woods routine here.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   But I think that the more transparency we have,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.200]   the more government is accountable,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.840]   and more corporations are accountable.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.320]   And I think in terms of this discussion
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.560]   and a lot of technology, this is where
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.920]   you get to things like unregulated white space
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.720]   in broadcast, which Google fought for,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.280]   which would create competition to wired and wireless broadband.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.080]   Does our future rely on benign corporations like Google?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.680]   That's the big question.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.800]   I think you're really asking us how benign is Google.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.960]   Well, we don't know.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.560]   That's the problem.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.440]   I'm not sure I would trust benign corporations over our government.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:33.880]   I don't know.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.920]   Who do we trust now?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.120]   Maybe we have to be freedom fighters, Jeff.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.360]   We have to take to the streets.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   I agree.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.000]   Yeah, we are the government.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.720]   We just aren't acting like it is a people.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.800]   Right.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.240]   But I think structurally the problem is that as Americans,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:57.160]   we are taught, conditioned, encouraged to distrust and fear
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.280]   our government.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.520]   And that's like the grandest American tradition
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   is throw the bastards out there all corrupt.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.520]   I'm fine with that.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.240]   But at some point, you have to be like, well,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.440]   we have to solve problems.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.480]   You need to trust some bastards.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.800]   Right.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.280]   And somebody in there--
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   It's not Google anymore.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.200]   You only tell somebody about it.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.680]   You're the best.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.480]   That's not the best one ever.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.360]   Because anybody--
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.200]   but I wouldn't do it.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.520]   Nobody who has a brain would serve.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.000]   Or is that true?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   Go ahead, Ed.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.440]   I could see you want to jump in.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.320]   I think the most worrying thing about politics
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.120]   is the people who want to become politicians is true.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.200]   Should we have compulsory political service
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.560]   like they have compulsory military service?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.800]   At the age of five.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.040]   Even I, man of the people, stopped the line at the kid
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.160]   in the Burger King becoming my rumor.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:44.880]   What happened?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.240]   I think ultimately you have to have professional politicians.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.440]   I--
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.240]   I'm not--
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.080]   Go ahead.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.600]   I would run, but I have birth certificate issues.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.080]   So really--
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.880]   Oh, easy for you to get off.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   So the non-citizen--
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.800]   So the truth is, it is terrible.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.560]   It's not our fault.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.680]   It's not our fault.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.840]   Just can't see it.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.800]   We'll just migrate if it gets too tough in.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.280]   Well, let's talk about a pie in the face.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.640]   As you mentioned, the Rupert Murdoch word, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.520]   It's kind of a shame that the pie in the face happened.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.640]   You have to wonder, what kind of security
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.480]   that a guy who was carrying a shaving cream pie could walk
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.680]   right up to Rupert Murdoch and hit him?
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.640]   I love my country.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.000]   I mean--
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.280]   I love the fact that people can still
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.080]   throw pies in the face of the floor.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.720]   For the end of us.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.000]   That's good.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.680]   It did kind of distract, unfortunately.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.840]   I think the case could be made that maybe it'd be better
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.160]   if the testimony had continued.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.120]   And maybe it was Rebecca-- what's her name?
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.760]   Rebecca Baker?
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.800]   Maybe it was her-- no, Rebecca-- who's the woman?
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.520]   Wendy?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.840]   The Redhead.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.000]   Oh, Rebecca Brooks.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Brooks.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.840]   Maybe it was Rebecca Brooks who paid for the pie throw,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.280]   because then it put off her testimony.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.080]   Gave her a little extra time, maybe.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.640]   You never know.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.440]   But I mean, we do huff and puff and make scandals and so on.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.920]   But we also don't take ourselves too seriously.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.640]   So--
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.720]   I'll take the pie for that.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.640]   All right.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.760]   What has your take got Jeff so far on the--
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.920]   Ah, I--
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.440]   You watched with wrapped attention yesterday?
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.920]   Absolutely.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.440]   Hard not to.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.280]   Absolutely.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.520]   It was just an amazing show.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.000]   And I think Rupert is as dotty as they get now.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.160]   And they were trying to put it on that, or that was a show.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.920]   Or it was Rupert trying to go for sympathy.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.800]   And if that was the humblest day of his life,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.320]   then it shows how humble he is, which
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.840]   is not at all.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.520]   I agree with that.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.640]   I find it interesting that the nation that invented much
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.000]   of our government got rid of all this notion
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.440]   of talking about my honorable friend, the gentleman from Georgia.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.360]   And they just say things.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.560]   They just talk.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   And it has less formality and less BS.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.800]   But that show part aside, I think
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.480]   that I come back to what I said earlier.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.320]   I think that there is an incest among the institutions
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.520]   in society, which sounds awfully broad.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:07.880]   But it is.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.480]   But we really saw it in a shocking way
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   that how close the newspaper company
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.400]   was to the highest seat of power, how close they were
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.360]   to the police, how the police hired the newspaper
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.320]   people to go deal with the newspaper people.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.520]   It really is pretty--
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.040]   It was so cozy.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.400]   It was so cozy, wasn't it?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.880]   Geez.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.320]   Which is also a part of me, Ed.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.880]   Britain.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.600]   I mean, not to be too cynical, but I'm pretty sure it's
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.760]   always been that way.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.160]   And what's happened now is that we get a glimpse,
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.520]   and they really let it slide.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.440]   But I don't see that over the last 50 years,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.840]   we've worked any differently.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   Interesting.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   I kind of got off track.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.880]   I mean, it's not really RV.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.520]   But I just thought we got a Brit here.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.600]   We got Jeff Jarvis here.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.480]   We ought to really talk a little bit about it.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.880]   I keep on throwing out the speculation
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.360]   that the news corp will have to get professional management.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.960]   When that happens, where the newspaper is,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.920]   it will become an entertainment company, which
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.200]   is what it really is.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.000]   And actually, you've been really outspoken.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.880]   In fact, I thought you've been very quite cranky on Google
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.480]   Plus lately, Jeff.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.000]   Copy mad, yeah.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   But that's really-- I've been following it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.680]   The Google Plus has been a great place to follow that story,
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.240]   oddly enough.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, I disagree there, Leo.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.520]   I think, well, at least for a take during the hearing.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.080]   Twitter was, I think, a much better way to follow it,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.000]   because the chronology was safe.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.160]   You didn't know who to follow.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.960]   Whereas at Google Plus, the breaking of the chronology--
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.720]   You get animated GIF then news, then animated GIF then news.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.160]   And then animated GIF of the pie.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.320]   You get a kick stat.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.560]   No, I agree with you.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.480]   You're right.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.160]   And the lack of a hashtag, again.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.880]   We've talked about that before, and we don't want
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.560]   to go into a full Google Plus show again.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.840]   But I think that one thing that Twitter sees
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.880]   is the need to create the infrastructure for people
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.200]   to gather around topics, places, times, memes, things like that.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.240]   Google Plus, I want to know if he doesn't have that.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.080]   We know there are different things that are happening here.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.400]   On Twitter, you're getting real live,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.000]   repotage, and comment.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.440]   On Google Plus, I'm finding I'm getting thoughtful debate.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.160]   Conversation.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.680]   Engage that.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.880]   Yeah, the op-eds, the considered stuff.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.280]   I can't necessarily make sense of the tweet stream.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.600]   And of course, if you create a circle that's just people
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.640]   who are writing about this, you could follow that circle
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.960]   quite effectively.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.560]   I think actually, most of the complaints
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   I hear about Google Plus are from people who aren't using--
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.720]   or just following everything, who aren't using circles.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.920]   They're not doing it right.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.560]   You're doing it wrong.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.640]   It's a user error.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.360]   Don't you understand?
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.200]   Make circles, use them.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.400]   No, actually, I'm not surprised,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.040]   because it's such a pain in the ass to make circles.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   But that is--
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.560]   There is a solution.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.000]   You think of the pain in the ass?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.280]   Well, it's easier than other circles,
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.640]   other list-making tools.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   But--
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.440]   Let's talk about Ed's article, actually.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.800]   I think this is an interesting piece.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.720]   Why Google Plus isn't just another social network?
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.080]   Can you synapseize for us, Ed?
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.560]   Sure.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.840]   I mean, I've been thinking about this a bit over the last week
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.400]   and feeling that casting Google Plus just against Facebook
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.360]   and as a competitive service was a very narrow view
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.600]   of what's actually going on.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.480]   One of the unique things about Google
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.880]   is they don't need to make money out of the social graph.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.680]   No ads on it at all now.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.000]   Right now, their business does not
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.520]   depend on it in a way that Twitter and Facebook can't say that.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.120]   Well, Twitter can.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   Only because they have enough VCs, they can keep going.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.280]   But ultimately, they're right.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   That's got to be a business.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.440]   Right.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.360]   That puts them in a very interesting position
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.400]   to be able to commoditize what they're actually
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   offering with creating circles and sharing a notification
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   and really opening it up.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   We haven't seen the API yet, of course.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.080]   But I've high hopes from the kind of signals
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.720]   that they're giving out that it'll be pretty open.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.360]   And suddenly, they can make these notifications sharing
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.440]   friending services available to anyone who
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.160]   wants to incorporate them without feeling
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.480]   they have to own them.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   Without saying Facebook, well, you can have this,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.040]   but only as long as it serves our purposes.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.880]   It strikes me that also Google+, Twitter really--
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   and this is what you were talking about a little bit,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   Jeff, with following this trial.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.520]   Twitter really is a signal.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.920]   It's an information signal.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   It's almost a nervous system of content flowing over a signal.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.440]   Whereas Google+ really is much more like email, much more
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.000]   like communications medium.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.560]   Or discussion medium.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.720]   But I mean, in fact, I think it can--
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   as some have done, including Mike Elgin, incredibly
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.880]   replace email.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.960]   I think--
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.600]   I come from the point of view that computers are here
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.880]   to servers.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   And particularly with the social systems,
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   the more they model what we like to do in real life, which
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.400]   is not standard at the top of a building.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.320]   Yelling up people in 140 characters,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.080]   it's getting in groups having conversations.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.800]   And that's a platform where we can fit computers into really
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.120]   helping us make sense of the world.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.520]   But Ed, I'm finding already--
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.280]   I'm fearing for the scaling of Google+.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.160]   Because even though they have latest numbers, 18 million
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.200]   users or whatever, it ain't 750 million.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.320]   And how many threads-- I finally installed comment
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.200]   plus as an extension so I could cut down all the comment threads.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.280]   Because a 200 comment thread is not a conversation.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.560]   It's useless.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.840]   It gets back to-- oh, I'm going to say it--
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.800]   the problems I had with buzz.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:53.640]   It's when I--
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   People say, oh, you're not back.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.000]   You're talking with us.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.800]   Well, no.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.120]   Because I can't even deal with 200 comments.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   I had something to say.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.200]   If people were saying something interesting back,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.040]   you repeat yourselves like millions of times.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.440]   I still like Google+.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.800]   But I see a real problem there that's only going to get worse,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.360]   no?
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.480]   Well, this is kind of the power user problem.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.720]   It isn't to-- for 99% of Google+ users,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.600]   they're probably not going to suffer too much of this.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.800]   But it really matters because people who shape opinion
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.760]   are the ones who suffer from it, right?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.640]   The whole scoble issue.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.840]   Oh, God.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.480]   It's a whole bundle of issues.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   I want to block scoble.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.280]   And I love Robert.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.040]   And he's an old friend.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.400]   But I want to block him because it's too meta for me.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.080]   I want to actually use Google+.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.680]   I make a point now of not saying anything about Google+
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.640]   on Google+.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.760]   You know who I just blocked?
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   It's like Fight Club.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.000]   Who?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.440]   I just blocked Caliconis.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.560]   He did the worst comment bait I've ever seen.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.400]   He's giving away a sonos to anyone who--
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.360]   random when he would have leaves him a comment.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.800]   Are you surprised?
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.440]   No.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.640]   I never circled him in the first place for that very reason.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.280]   I am terrified when it happens, though.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.520]   We know when the brand is not coming.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.880]   Is that the verb to circle someone?
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.800]   Well, we can't decide.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.120]   Some people have been saying to circle him size.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.160]   No, that's when you take him out.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.000]   I think to circle him.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:15.880]   It's got work.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   You circle him to put him in.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.000]   Or encircle him size.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.400]   How about encircle?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.160]   That just sounds very German.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.000]   You have been encircled.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.760]   You will enjoy it.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   I won't say this, but my experience in Google+ so far.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.840]   I think the reason that we're all busy talking about how good it
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   is in engagement and how interesting it is
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.720]   and how you have these great conversations
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.040]   is because Google was smart enough
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.120]   to open it up to a bunch of journalists and Google employees
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.240]   to begin with.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.120]   So our early experiences were-- it was us.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.200]   It was these conversations that we have amongst each other.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.840]   And I think when you begin to scale it,
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.960]   I think that's going to begin to deteriorate.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.920]   I'm curious to see how that takes place.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.400]   Because--
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.920]   It'd be like that.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.960]   I think it's cool.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.200]   Right now, it's a cocktail party.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   And cocktail parties are interesting and fun,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.960]   no matter what form you have them in.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.640]   And when it goes to a cocktail party to Lala Palooza,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.120]   then things change.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.520]   Well, what I think you're saying is
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.920]   you're heading to a point where you don't control
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   the discussion that happens because--
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.960]   sorry, I'm pixelating badly.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.720]   Trying to stay very subtractive, though.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.560]   I like it.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.120]   I do not move.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.680]   A Roar Jacques test.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.320]   To heck with it.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.440]   I have bad skin today.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.920]   So that you can put out something and you don't have any
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.360]   control over how many people can comment on it.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.120]   So it's not your cocktail party anymore.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.160]   Well, let me put something to you, right?
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.680]   When the web started, we could list every web page on an
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.080]   index on who?
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   Right.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.840]   And people were saying, how's this going to scale?
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.120]   I can't read it anymore.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.400]   And Google, another search engine, just came along and
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.600]   made sense of that.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.400]   If we're engaged with this, I've got to have some kind of
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.200]   faith that Google are looking at this problem and probably
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.480]   more than anybody else who got tools to figure out how to
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.000]   solve it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.720]   Absolutely agree.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.680]   I think what we're doing is having the hubris to try to do
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.440]   the job for them.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:06.760]   Right.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.080]   Just relax and float downstream on the--
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.200]   On the surface of things, right?
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.880]   I mean, it's curious.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.120]   I think it's good that Facebook has a serious
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.360]   competitor in social now.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.640]   I think Facebook will respond in some interesting way as well.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.960]   I'm happy to see them going at it directly.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.920]   I know that your argument is that--
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.760]   It's not Facebook.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.640]   It's not Facebook.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.960]   But I think this will push Facebook to want to be that
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.360]   social layer that they already were.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   I think that's what Facebook perceived itself as.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.800]   And I think they're going to realize now that they have to
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.320]   be much broader in terms of allowing access to the graph
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.160]   and in terms of spreading their friend relationships across
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.360]   the web than they'd ever anticipated being.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:50.760]   Right.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.480]   I mean, being open is one very good way to undermine your
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.600]   competitors.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.040]   You don't have to go far in the land of Google to look at
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.000]   Android.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.080]   And that kind of all embracing, welcoming attitude has
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.520]   pretty much helped them eclipse, I ask.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.640]   And I think if they apply the same kind of strategy here,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.760]   then because the friending or the following model is much
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.640]   more fluid, much more versatile, and they don't have the same
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.840]   kind of brand associations as Facebook, they're in a great
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.400]   position to open up and have the kind of services that
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.840]   Google+ provides flow through many kinds of web applications.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.800]   It's in, as you say, it's infrastructure.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.240]   Right.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.880]   And I think we just haven't seen where it's going because we
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.160]   haven't seen an API yet.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.240]   I think it's such early days that there aren't tools attached
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.520]   to it for comment control.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.320]   There's all sorts of things missing.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.640]   But they've got to do one thing first.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.320]   They've got to do the job better than Facebook or as good as
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.760]   Facebook in the first place before they can take it further.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.920]   Well, they learned that from Buzz because Buzz had--
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.960]   I mean, Buzz could have been just as important of an
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.000]   announcement, but by launching it in a wonky fashion, they
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.120]   killed it, basically.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.560]   And so they need to learn from that.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.000]   You're right.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.960]   It has to launch in a way that doesn't kill it before it gets
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.120]   to its maturity.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.120]   But I just think there's so much more.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.760]   And it becomes infrastructure when you have an API, you
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.120]   have it become background to a lot of other things.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.760]   And then it can really be valuable, I think.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.640]   And that deals with all the problems you have, Jeff.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.120]   Because it's no longer something you go to the plus
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.880]   page to look at.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.120]   I think once the API comes-- what's going to be really
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.040]   fascinating here is when the API comes out and to see what
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   happens with it then, what gets fixed by the community.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.440]   Part of-- I remember, and the irony of this is, Fred Wilson
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.280]   said this about Twitter when I complained about some things
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.040]   I wanted on Twitter.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.080]   And he said, that's not Twitter's job.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.240]   That's developer's job.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.520]   Well, not so much anymore.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.360]   Not anymore now.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.800]   But I think that Google will--
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.240]   Google will do it that way, though.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.920]   Yeah, they will.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.560]   And I think that they have this basis.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.480]   And when you build into that, things like the profile
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.640]   become incredibly important.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.720]   And they're putting value into that.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   That becomes part of the infrastructure of this.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.400]   But I think developers could do amazing things with this.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.880]   And that's what will have them eclipse Twitter.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   I think Twitter is the more important.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.840]   I think it could eclipse email.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.640]   I think it could eclipse a lot of things.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.200]   I think it could be a new form of communication.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   And--
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.480]   But it's very interesting you say email,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.040]   because despite repeated rumors of its death,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.320]   email still hasn't gone.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   Well, I wish it would go.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.960]   It just tortures us.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.320]   That's all.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.640]   Yeah, I just wish it would go.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.280]   Yeah, why?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.240]   You love email?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.840]   I run my business on email.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.040]   Why do you think you love email?
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.240]   I love email.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.840]   But do you want to run your business on email?
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.640]   I can't imagine what else I would run it on.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.040]   I mean, whether they're kind of distributed, secure,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.520]   only I can see it system, are you going to trust?
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.520]   So here's why email works is because it best models what
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.400]   we want to do in real life and society.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.000]   Well, being bugged by all kinds of people who tuck at my coat
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.160]   and tell me things of what I don't want them to tell it to me,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.520]   it's like a one of the subway.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.280]   They are the trappings of fame, Jeff.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.520]   Just five minutes from your point of view.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   The trappings of fame.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.920]   You're pointing out again that he doesn't
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.520]   have a normal experience.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.680]   Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, my job as a journalist
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   is to distribute information to people.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.600]   And, you know, part of that means
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.040]   active filter through information.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.080]   We'll get rid of the stuff.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.040]   Jeff is just ranting at me in silence.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.560]   I don't know who to go ahead.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.040]   Can we hear you?
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.760]   I hear him.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.680]   Don't you hear him?
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.400]   I couldn't hear him.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.720]   Oh, I can make myself heard.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.440]   I didn't mean to talk over you.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.520]   We'll take a Chipotle break, and then we'll come back.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   The fighters go to their corners,
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   and we will continue in a moment.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.960]   Nylai Patel is here from this ismynecks.com.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.800]   Soon to be the Verge.com.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.000]   Will that change the beat that you cover?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.400]   No.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.680]   But more than gadgets.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.240]   Yeah, it will be gadgets we're going to do.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.680]   I mean, I think we recognize the things
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.320]   that Google+ and Facebook and Twitter
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.800]   are they're an important part of what you do with gadgets.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.600]   And I think the reason we're not called like, you know,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   webtech.com is because we want to be about culture and society
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.120]   as well as megabytes and display resolution.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.680]   So we're going to get a little bigger.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.520]   It's going to be more than three posts a day on this one.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   OK, but I was reading Gizmodo, and they had an article about a woman
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.440]   who has a nipple on her foot.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.160]   No, we will not have any nipple foot articles.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.040]   Thank you.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.600]   I'll tell you that right now.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.680]   Brian Lamb leaves, and one week later, they've got nipple foot.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.480]   And it's like, this is not why I go to Gizmodo.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.080]   They're ready to step into the breach
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.880]   that the news of the world is laughing on you.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:44.040]   Apparently, there is a huge gap, a nipple foot gap.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.600]   But now you know, one more thing Leo, how did it get there?
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.760]   I didn't put it there.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.120]   Somebody emailed it to them.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.640]   Shut down.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.600]   Shut down.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   Shut down.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.200]   I believe it.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.920]   Who cares?
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.360]   I don't understand why I'm scrolling through.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.920]   And by the way, it's on my portable, my mobile, my Android,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.960]   which means that it's like taking over my phone with his nipple foot.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.200]   And I don't want to see it.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.040]   I don't want to see it.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.560]   I will promise you right now that there will be no nipple foot.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.960]   This is my next nipple.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   Good.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.160]   I can make you that watermark.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.680]   The very--
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.600]   Nipple foot on the verge, please.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:17.960]   No.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   That sounds like the worst album name of all time.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.280]   Nipple-- oh, it's a good band name, nipple foot.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   Nipple foot on the verge.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.080]   You heard of Nickelback?
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.440]   No, we're nipple foot.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.080]   Staira.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's awful.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.520]   And I'm sorry.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   Somebody go by a brick from nipple foot just for Leo.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.760]   I'm just saying.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.000]   I'm just saying, please, there's a better way.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.680]   And I know that Nili and company--
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.320]   by the way, Joshua, he's very good on Jimmy Fallon.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   He is very good on him.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:44.840]   Talk about it.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.240]   I was in the audience that day live.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.480]   They ate it up.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.200]   I have never seen anything.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.120]   When he gave all those Chromebooks away,
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.080]   I have never seen a frenzy like that.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:54.840]   How did that--
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.880]   Did you guys get something from Google to do that,
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.920]   or how did that work?
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.640]   Yeah, you know, you have to ask him.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.560]   But the backstory that he told me
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.480]   was he was going to demo the Chromebook.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.840]   He thinks it's a really cool idea.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.600]   And we all do, right?
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.480]   And he said, well, I've always wanted to do an Oprah giveaway.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:10.960]   Can we do it?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.160]   And Google was super into it.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.440]   They--
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.880]   Sure, why not?
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.400]   It was great.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   They had a--
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.600]   when we were leaving, the audience,
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.840]   they had a huge pallet of them stacked up in the lobby.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.520]   People were running towards them.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.960]   They had to do crowd control.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.640]   It was wild.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.040]   The woman in front of me, when they--
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.480]   I was in the audience with Ross from the Verge and my fiance.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.000]   And we were sitting there.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   We knew it was going to happen.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.600]   But the people in front of us just freaked out.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   They were like, it was like--
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.200]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.600]   And the mom leaned over to the daughter
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.680]   and said, this is just the most perfect day I've ever had.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.520]   Oh my god.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.040]   And I was like, it's like a $350.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   That justifies your belief in the Chromebook,
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.280]   which I personally don't get.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.240]   So maybe you guys are right.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.720]   I have it.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.360]   It's here.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.280]   We were playing with it last night.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   I put it after 20 minutes.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.680]   I put it down and opened up my real computer.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.440]   So there's-- you can't run Skype on it.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:00.960]   I couldn't do this.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.760]   Well, that's kind of my point is, like, if I just
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.320]   want a browser, I'll just launch the browser.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.920]   But people-- I've never seen anything.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.600]   There was people falling out in the audience.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.400]   They were like, the rapture had descended on them.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.760]   And it was that Samsung.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.920]   That's people who go to TV shows.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.840]   That's who that is.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   It was cool.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.480]   It's like, hey, we're in New York.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.600]   How about free tickets to sit during the phone?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.480]   But more to the point, you got to announce the verge
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.120]   on network television.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.600]   That's pretty freaking great.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   It was really cool.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.240]   I mean, I've never been a part of a new I've had before.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.480]   And it was cool.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.120]   I was humbling.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.960]   And thank you, Jimmy, for letting us do it
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.080]   and for having Josh-- for putting up with Josh.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.560]   Josh is 10th appearance.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.280]   You think you would have worn out his welcome by now?
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.760]   It's amazing.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.840]   I'm about to quit.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.680]   Actually, I can't stand it.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.240]   Jeff Jarvis is also with us.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.280]   He's cranky, but he's happy.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.720]   Hey, hey, who was cranky?
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.600]   No, you were cranky.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.560]   You've been cranky this week.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.960]   I thought, gosh, I hope Jeff's all right.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.880]   He's awfully cranky on Google+.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.480]   Maybe it's Google+, he's making you cranky.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.960]   Maybe.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.080]   Am I wrong?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.680]   Jeff.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   Jeff.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.000]   You don't think you're a little cranky?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.120]   Is the weather hot?
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.480]   Is it like hot weather that's making you a little--
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.680]   We lie down on the couch, Leo.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.320]   Get some jafot.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.120]   Also, Ed Dumble is with us from all riding media.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.680]   We're talking right now, though, about squarespace.com,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.880]   the secret behind exceptional websites
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.480]   and a great place to go for your first website
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.040]   or this is my next website.com.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.080]   Actually, I just got my ham license last week.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.000]   And so I've immediately--
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.640]   Congratulations.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.160]   Thank you.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.600]   I've been a ham for my whole life,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.320]   but finally I have a piece of paper that proves it.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.160]   That boy, it's so fun.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.640]   The gear you get, I just got my radios.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.360]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.840]   But first thing I do is go to squarespace.com.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.520]   I click this big try at free button, put my call letters in.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.440]   I said, I've got a new website, and I set it up.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.600]   And it's so fast--
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.080]   I'm not showing it to you yet, because the call letters
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.280]   aren't officially it, so I can't show it to you.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.160]   Oh, I've got this stupid upside down scrolling.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.280]   It's going to drive me crazy.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.360]   The mouse goes up, the page goes down.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.480]   Everything's all around around.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.840]   See that?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.200]   I'm scrolling.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.480]   OK, look.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.960]   I'm scrolling the mouse up, but the website goes--
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.880]   Oh.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.320]   I'm going to have to change that.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.280]   It makes sense on it.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.080]   For some reason, it makes sense on it.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.480]   First thing I did, turn it off.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.120]   Turn it off, yeah.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.640]   I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.320]   This is the secret behind exceptional websites,
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.520]   no matter how you scroll it.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.880]   And what you'll do there is set up the site.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.240]   You get to use all the features.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.200]   You've got two weeks free.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.600]   Try the templates, the social integration,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.200]   the little widgets that let you put your Twitter
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.400]   or your Facebook.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.760]   And as soon as there's an API, I'm sure Google+ in there.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.520]   Actually, because there's Google+ RSS,
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.920]   you can actually just put the RSS feeds in there.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.320]   The widgets support any kind of RSS.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.640]   Point and click, drag and drop.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.920]   You don't have to be a HTML guru to do this.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.560]   You're going to get a great site and great hosting too.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.800]   And that's really important because it's one thing
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.320]   to have software.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.520]   It's nothing entirely to have a great host.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.960]   People often ask me, who's the best host, is Squarespace.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.800]   For your photo blog, for your business,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.360]   for your nonprofit, for your ham radio station,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.760]   whatever you want to do, this is a great place.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.480]   Price very affordable.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.800]   Remember, you're getting hosting and software.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.360]   The longer you sign up for, of course,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.120]   the less it costs, it starts $12 a month.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.600]   You can even get down to $10 a month.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.120]   But let me tell you this.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.680]   If you use the offer code TWIG7, you'll get 10% off
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   for the first six months.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.600]   And that's a good deal.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.400]   Squarespace.com, sign up for the free site.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.240]   Play with it.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.560]   If you decide you want to buy it,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:52.240]   use the offer code TWIG7 for 10% off for the first six months.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.680]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.440]   Why are you laughing?
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.320]   This is my next website.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   That's why I'm laughing because the people in the chat room,
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.760]   I have our little Mac mini review unit here.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.280]   Oh.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.920]   They're yelling at me to go open it and review it live.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.520]   You have the new Mac mini, huh?
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.160]   Yeah, it's over in the corner.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.640]   But I would show it to you what I have to unbox it.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.040]   Oh, it's kind of skinny and pretty.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.680]   And you can add ram now without a butter knife, which is nice.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.760]   Yeah, the whole bottom is like, that was the old one.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.480]   This is just new processors.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.680]   It's a really nice computer.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.800]   I mean, it's cheaper.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.240]   High five.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.200]   600 starting.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.320]   And Joanna Stern has our review unit of the new Air.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.440]   So that'll be--
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.080]   I think she's hard at work on that review right now.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.120]   How did she get that assignment?
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.760]   She's our reviews editor.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.960]   She's what she does.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.320]   She--
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.960]   She decided to herself is what she did.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.520]   Yeah, it's pretty much exactly what I'm doing that assignment.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.760]   Post to the door.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.000]   So Google just announced this one.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.560]   This is kind of a shocker.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.680]   I like the name of the title of this blog post.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.280]   "More wood behind fewer arrows."
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.400]   Google is shutting down Google Labs.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.160]   Wow.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.120]   While we've learned a huge amount--
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.080]   writes Bill Cogren, SVP for Research and Systems
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.240]   Infrastructure.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.280]   By launching very early prototypes and labs,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.520]   we believe that greater focus is crucial
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.480]   if we're to make the most of the extraordinary opportunities
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.240]   ahead.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.480]   So they're going to either save labs experiments that
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.000]   are going on right now into product areas, or shut them down.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.080]   If they take multiple inbox away from me,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.280]   I will throw a gigantic fit.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.120]   I'll say that right now.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.920]   This kind of surprises me.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.320]   It does mean to a shock speed.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.200]   I think what's next to go, the 20% rule?
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.600]   It is a big shift.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.640]   They say, well, continue to push speed and innovation,
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.280]   but not through the Labs website.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:49.080]   So there are so many cool things in here.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.480]   I don't know.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.280]   I mean, there's something going on, isn't that?
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.880]   Because the Labs are really cool, and there's nifty stuff.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.200]   But for a while, particularly last year,
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.240]   I felt that the pace of changing Google Apps and so on,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.920]   it kind of stalled.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.600]   It's pretty much the same.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.160]   Gmail wasn't doing anything more for me,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.920]   despite the fact that I got more email and so on.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.080]   That seems to have picked up now.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.440]   And I wonder this is just kind of like a continuation
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.400]   to realization that they can't let their main product lines
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.960]   linger, and they might need to be a bit more focused
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.400]   about improving stuff.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.680]   Yeah, it is about-- I think it's Larry and Vocus.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.000]   I think that's the word they use.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.680]   But what that means to me is more control from the top,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.280]   even more of what comes out.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.680]   Boy, I'd really like to know what's going on in there.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.080]   It feels like there's a culture shift in this company.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.640]   So GigaOM has an update on their story.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   Google spokesman says Gmail Labs, Calendar Labs,
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.200]   and other labs will not be shut down.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.520]   Just the labs for a game that brought us Google Goggles
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.720]   and Google Reader, which sounds terrible.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.440]   So it sounds like they're just diversifying these efforts
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.240]   back into their main product categories,
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.880]   instead of having this one kind of cohesive website.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   But you just said two things, two great things, which
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.040]   came out of the labs, Reader and Goggles.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.680]   Right.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.720]   I mean, I depend on Reader.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.440]   I don't add--
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.520]   Me too.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.440]   I mean, I don't think they're going
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.200]   to do anything serious with that.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.440]   No, but I guess the question--
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.440]   but it's a point is these labs are--
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.400]   it's like AT&T shutting down Bell Labs.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.880]   This is where good stuff comes from.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.600]   Oh, they did.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.240]   And they did.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.720]   I guess the question is, would Reader still
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.920]   be able to come out of a division,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.760]   or would Reader was just something wholly new that
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.920]   wouldn't exist?
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.840]   They must have a plan.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.720]   I mean, I think this is a combination of Larry and Sergey,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.160]   because Larry is in charge of execution.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.120]   Sergey's in charge of new products.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.760]   I think they're trying to really divide up the rules.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   And you've got to focus on making new products better
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.680]   in order to execute your long-term plans, right?
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.080]   That's what this feels like.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.440]   They're just trying to streamline
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.560]   instead of being the chaotic playground that is Google.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.000]   I don't know if that's good or bad,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.400]   but that's what this feels like to me.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:02.840]   It's so much--
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.880]   If they take--
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   I will say this now.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.560]   Hear me now, Google.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.840]   If you take away multiple inboxes,
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.800]   I will come over there.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Oh, it says they won't.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.200]   I will come over there.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.040]   That don't make me ask you.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.480]   Don't make me pull this podcast over.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.160]   So I do feel like there is a shift, though, going on at Google.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.480]   I mean, I think G+, in a way, is kind of as a new Google.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.200]   But I already-- I get a message right now.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.520]   When I did a search through my Chrome Bar for the Ola port,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.480]   it says on the search results page, the top,
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   the experiment you're trying to access
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.160]   is no longer available.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.360]   Now, I don't know what experiment it was.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   That's a problem.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:41.880]   It is.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.280]   Does it only come out for Leo?
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.000]   It's the Leo La Porte experiment.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.120]   But that's it.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.960]   I don't know.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.560]   It's like those moments on Google+ where you see a post.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.920]   It says the post is no longer here.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.960]   That's the only time you really want to wish you could read it.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.040]   Well, I'm using this lab thing, which is the voice search.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:58.920]   We're using voice search.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.760]   It's still working for me.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.200]   Jeff-- oh, let's do another one.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.000]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.160]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.560]   I just want to see if it understands.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.280]   Yeah, and it said, yeah, Java it.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   Or, yeah, yeah, a bit.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.360]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.120]   Instead of Jeff Jarvis, I get me.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.280]   Ripple Charles.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.480]   That's the done.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.400]   That's-- I guess it knew what I wanted.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.360]   I mean, don't you really just find yourself.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.680]   Fundamentally, you're always just Googling yourself.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.800]   Could they go wrong if they just replaced all searches
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.720]   with ego searches?
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.560]   They couldn't go wrong.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.680]   It would just be a natural.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.280]   One thing Google did, I really have to praise.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.840]   Well, actually, OK.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.520]   I won't say anything.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.360]   I'll let you guys weigh on on this.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.720]   But if you did a Google search--
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.040]   I don't know if it's still going on.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.640]   But if you did a Google search yesterday from google.com
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.720]   and you had malware on your machine, it would tell you.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.280]   Right.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:57.800]   Because--
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.560]   I think it's good.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.080]   I think it's good.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.440]   They knew it.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.200]   Because there was some--
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.920]   the malware was sending all the requests
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.200]   through a certain proxy.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.280]   So if you came from the IP address of that proxy,
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.720]   they could figure out that you were infected.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.760]   But I--
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   very public spirited.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   Nothing wrong with you guys.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:12.800]   I think it's more than that.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.000]   I saw Matt cuts at Google a week ago when I was out there.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.440]   And he swore me to secrecy.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.360]   I was already sworn to secrecy by being in the facility.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.760]   But now that they've done it, what's interesting here
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.080]   is that it's also a form of crowdsourcing in the way.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.840]   It's a way to expose the depth of the malware problem.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.640]   What they're saying in part here is people
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.480]   are running malware and they have no way to know it.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.720]   So this now surfaces that.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.440]   Well, and I think it is public spirited.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.600]   If Google knows it and doesn't say anything about it,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.920]   that would be wrong.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.360]   Exactly.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.880]   So it gives you--
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.760]   it's like we're all getting hemorrhoid checks thanks to Google.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.960]   We're going to ask a piece today.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.000]   Is that really the right comparison for me?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.080]   You can't be like, we're all getting a flu shot.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   You're going to write for the hemorrhoid.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:01.960]   It's not a probe.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.920]   It's going to be renamed to cough.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.440]   Nice.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.800]   Jeff and I are just giving you a little preview of your future
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   as you age.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.640]   Nailine.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.600]   That was terrible.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   It's a little something to look forward to.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.840]   And over.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.480]   Nothing like a colonoscopy on a summer day.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.720]   So by the way, summer day, July 20,
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.520]   on this day in 1969--
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.680]   come on.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.440]   I saw it on the chat room already.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.360]   Well, do you tell us then?
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.920]   Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.720]   Well, he did.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.520]   That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for a man.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.080]   And then Michael Bay blew it up.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.840]   And then they blew it up.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.640]   Immediately after.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.200]   It's moon day.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.280]   And tomorrow is Marshall McLuhan's 100th birthday.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.040]   And in neither case, as Google celebrated, but no,
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.480]   but they do have peas on their front page
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.680]   because this is also Gregor Mendels.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.120]   What is it?
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.560]   89th birthday.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.040]   That's pretty good.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.440]   That's obscure.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.760]   It could have had a moonwalk on there.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.200]   But I do like the illustration.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.080]   The Google doodles kind of cool.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.640]   This is kind of a strange role that Google's playing
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.760]   as the socialist state that America doesn't have.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.320]   Warning is of infections that we need to get vaccinated
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.920]   against, educating us into scientific history.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.160]   It is.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.360]   Stay calm and get infected.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.800]   Google is a socialist overlord.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.560]   Is that a bad thing?
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.800]   Speaking of somebody from a socialist nation.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   Something to look forward to.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.120]   They managed to keep the tone so it doesn't annoy me.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.160]   But it's just an interesting phenomenon
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.280]   that the one's doing this first.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.880]   There is a meme going around of that British stay calm.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.120]   And I guess it's from World War II.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.520]   Stay calm and carry on.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.040]   And carry on.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.000]   Make a cup of tea.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.200]   And there's now those signs everywhere with everything on them.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.560]   The latest version is stay calm and plus one.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.040]   Stay calm and plus one.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.720]   Somebody made a stay calm and buy a brick for me.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.360]   Not good.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.480]   I like that.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.800]   And my favorite one is stay calm and eat cupcakes.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.720]   Yes.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.400]   Keep calm and carry on.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.280]   It's better than-- let's put it this way.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.400]   It's better than any animated cat gif you can think of.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.960]   Can someone please come up with an extension that
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.200]   just gets better?
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.440]   That's why you're cranky.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.200]   I knew it.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.080]   It is.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.600]   It is.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.080]   I just keep calm and carry on.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.200]   There's the original.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:31.680]   19 or 30 people.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.000]   Somebody's going to make an animated gif out of that.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.160]   Oh, I'm sure they have.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.400]   Just go to Google+ now, everybody, and make your--
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.360]   put your animated gifs up.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.240]   Let me just see if there's any animated gifs.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.360]   I think that we talked about this on Twitter.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.760]   And Jenny Jardan, who was admittedly one of the offenders.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.440]   She puts a lot of animated cat gifs up there.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.240]   But I love Jenny.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.640]   I mean, she's a one-one contributor.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.280]   She's got a great sensibility.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.800]   I don't mind the animated gifs.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.360]   Because you're a nice guy, Leo.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.200]   I said, in fact, that we may look back and say it
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.200]   was the animated gif that put Google+ on the map.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.240]   Oh.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.760]   Let me see if there's any in my--
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.560]   obviously, I'm scrolling the wrong way again.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.640]   See if there's any--
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.120]   That's really confusing when you use the mobile app,
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.040]   because they don't animate.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.560]   They don't animate.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.080]   I'm like, all these very strange pictures,
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.000]   which are the first frame, and they're no sense at all.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.440]   You're very right.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.400]   One thing Google did do well-- and it kind of surprised me.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.120]   I put an IMDB link in, and it rendered it beautifully.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.920]   And the Google guys say, oh, yeah,
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.880]   if the XML or HTML is properly formatted,
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.320]   when you put a link in, we'll always do the right thing.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.640]   So you're seeing a lot of links from a lot of sources
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.280]   that do format out very well.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.880]   And I think, obviously, the animated gif
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.800]   was an intentional thing.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.400]   But I think they're doing a really good job
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:51.120]   with interpreting URLs and making it a very rich stream.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.640]   I think if--
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.320]   No one has done an animated gif of the pie plate.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.840]   Well, because I don't think anybody saw it.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.960]   It's just from behind, right?
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.600]   There should be an animated gif.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.680]   TV was loopy, like it was an animated gif.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.640]   Right.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:08.920]   Well, of Mrs. Murdoch leaping to defend her husband,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.320]   which is a good argument for marrying a younger woman, I think.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.480]   Right?
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.840]   From a volleyball team.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.320]   Is she from a volleyball team?
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:16.760]   Yes, she is.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.200]   She spiked that guy.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.120]   She did.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.440]   Damn.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   Have you followed Trey Ratcliffe?
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   Oh, I'm a huge dude.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.000]   No, Trey, we know Trey because I've known him for a long time.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.880]   He's a regular on many of our shows.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.320]   He does amazing HDR photography.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.840]   And I would say that more than anyone,
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.080]   he has benefited from Google+, it has become the Trey Ratcliffe site.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.680]   He's really used it brilliantly.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.480]   He's put up just the right number of photos.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.160]   They're striking.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.160]   People love them.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.200]   But can I point out something?
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.920]   He's been doing this on Facebook and other social sites
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.800]   for a long time.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   He was a big bugs user.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.280]   It's not merely the Trey is brilliant.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.840]   It's that this is the right medium for him.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.560]   It's as I've been saying, this is about sharing.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.960]   And when you and Google did another brilliant thing,
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:05.560]   this light box is simply the best light box for photographs
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.920]   I've ever seen.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.280]   I mean, this is better than flicker.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.200]   The comments are there.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.600]   Other pictures are there.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.240]   The number of comments.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.320]   I mean, this is a really great way to look at pictures.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.840]   And I think a photographer like Trey, a lot of photographers,
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.760]   in fact, have really benefited from this.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.120]   So Trey--
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.880]   What becomes interesting about that, Leo, is if you're--
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.520]   does it become better at some point than YouTube
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.200]   to show your best video if you use Excel?
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.360]   I see a lot of YouTube photos.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.200]   There's a lot of videos on here.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.960]   Look at this.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.480]   See a lot of these.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.240]   I think the key thing is that it's
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.280]   in the conversation when it's on Google+,
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.560]   it's not out in a silo that's dedicated.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.880]   You're just walking into the room and showing people
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.760]   what you've done.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.160]   Is Google+ the world's biggest BBS?
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:50.640]   I think that's the one.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.000]   It is.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.080]   It's a forum, isn't it?
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.920]   It's really just a huge forum.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.000]   And they're trying to build the forum layer over the top.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.800]   It's an interesting way to look at it.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.000]   I'm just so curious how they're going to actually use
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.160]   my personal data.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.480]   Right?
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.720]   I mean, this is--
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.520]   It's not going to--
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.080]   --the theme of our show is, do you trust the data?
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.680]   You serve, you better serve.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.360]   Why would they?
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.480]   Yeah, why would they?
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.120]   What would they do?
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:14.960]   Come on, Neil.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.720]   First of all, they already know everything about you.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.360]   Just give in.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.080]   Just shut up.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:20.760]   Just give in.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.440]   Shut up.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.280]   Stay calm and shut up.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.760]   Relax and float on the downstream.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.480]   By the way, they have now banned the brands.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.120]   Dan Patterson of ABC News just posted on Google+,
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.280]   that they have in fact killed the ABC News radio page.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.040]   This is something they said they did not want brands to do this.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.440]   And I applied for the Twitter brand page on there.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:50.640]   I didn't jump the gun like Mashable, ABC, a lot of organizations.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.840]   Because I just thought, well, I'm going to honor their request
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.280]   not to do that.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   It's interesting, though, that they've actually clobbered them.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.080]   Degon.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.320]   Right.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   I mean, they had to, right?
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.680]   Because if you did the right thing,
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.280]   they couldn't say, well, there's the right thing.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   Right.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:04.760]   So people--
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.440]   --some people are too big to fail.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   That's a good socialist kind of way to run things.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:10.360]   You know what?
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.440]   Probably Mashable is the one who screwed it up for everybody else
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.000]   because they were like, now, the number four most followed
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.560]   page on there.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:16.920]   Let me see.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.120]   Yeah, they're--
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   Well, it's interesting that--
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.520]   so imagine if Twitter had done that at the beginning.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.920]   Twitter had created PeopleSpace and BrandSpace.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.320]   And then it could have monetized BrandSpace.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.120]   I think what we're going to see here is not advertising as we know it.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.520]   I think we're going to see brands using it.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.560]   And we have Michael Dell, who I'm sure followed our advice
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.160]   from the show three weeks ago.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.800]   And he's looking at how to use Plus for customer service
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.080]   and Hangouts for customer service.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.680]   So if you really look at--
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.440]   I was talking to a whole bunch of hyper local people.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.560]   And I said that they should look at the merchants in their towns
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.120]   as members of their community and finding ways
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   to serve their benefits and make money from that.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.400]   And I wonder whether that was where Google goes, whereas Twitter still
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.480]   is failing out there with no damn business plan.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.560]   Matthew Ingram wrote on Giga on today, according Dick Costolo,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.520]   saying they're going to become a real-time commerce company.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.920]   Wow.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.280]   Wow.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.920]   Meanwhile, you saw one of these stories.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:19.440]   And the list is Twitter just is supposedly closing an $800 million
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:24.360]   around $400 million, which will go to investors and employees.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.880]   And somebody said in--
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.840]   They're taking money off the table now.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.920]   And Google Plus said uncharitably it was a Ponzi scheme.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.880]   That's a little strong.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   But one should worry about a company
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.160]   that starts taking money off the table.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.120]   That's a group on did with their most recent round.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.880]   But on the other hand, what's happening
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.920]   is there are private markets now that are doing it anyway.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.200]   And I think it was Costolo, who said, or one of them
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.640]   said some event last week, that the private market exchanges
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.000]   are causing them big problems because employees are trying to cash out.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.560]   And so we really need a new structure for earlier markets.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.440]   Ah, it's very interesting.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   What a world we live in.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.360]   Google, while it's shutting down, Google Labs is apparently
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.520]   spending millions of dollars according to the New York
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.280]   Times to find the next Google.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:27.520]   Claire Kane Miller says that writing in the New York Times
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.840]   says Google is betting $200 million as a venture capital
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.560]   company looking for Google investments.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.880]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.720]   $200 million isn't a huge fund, is it?
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.320]   No, it's not.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.000]   Well, not for that.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.080]   No, they got $39 billion in the bank.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.320]   Google put in a billion or two.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.800]   Put some money in there.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.600]   What are you doing with all that money in the bank?
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.920]   Yeah, well, another thing to do, I think,
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.520]   if you look at the early days, didn't Kleiner Perkins
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.200]   start a Twitter fund?
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.320]   Yeah, they started a mobile fund.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.240]   What about the Twitter fund?
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   They did.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.600]   They twires Twitter fund for Twitter apps, I think.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.120]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.880]   What are the hell that's going for them?
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.080]   That's worth a store.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.800]   Hey, reporters out there, that's worth a story.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.640]   So why wouldn't Google-- why shouldn't Google,
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.720]   when they come with the API, start a plus fund?
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.880]   Google Ventures says it's invested as much money
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.040]   in the first half of 2011 as it did in all of 2010.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.320]   Larry Page says they're going to continue at that rate.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.720]   They are pumping money out there.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.920]   I think that's smart.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.760]   It hedges, doesn't it?
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.240]   I mean, you can't achieve all the innovation you want
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.720]   inside your company.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.280]   Close the labs.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.360]   It's impossible, and start a venture fund.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.560]   Not a bad idea.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.200]   Google spent at least a million dollars on G.CO.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.400]   This is the new domain I immediately checked.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.320]   And Twitter.co and Leo.co are already gone.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.080]   It didn't take any time at all.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.720]   I can't get my name, darn it, ever, anywhere.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.640]   But apparently, according to the .co, folks,
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.560]   CIO is Columbia.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.600]   The single letter domains, t.co is Twitter's shortening.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.240]   Google just bought G.CO.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.720]   The .co--
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.440]   Guy runs the .co registrar.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.840]   Juan Diego Cai said that it's north of $1 and 1/2 million
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.520]   to get a single letter .co.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.680]   They're making big money.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:19.880]   I mean--
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.520]   That's a good deal.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.400]   Those guys have been sponsoring the WebExpo conferences
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.920]   in Moscone for some years now.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.440]   Really?
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.280]   That's CIO.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.640]   Yeah, like big time spending.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.160]   Hmm.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.120]   Oh.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.760]   What do you-- is it Colombian drug lords
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.160]   laundering their cash?
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.360]   I'm not so authorized to tell you.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.400]   I have a new--
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:40.600]   Probably not.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.560]   --it's all about CIO.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.440]   Do you?
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.320]   Yeah, that's fine, because I couldn't get .com,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.560]   because nobody-- the person refuses for responding.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.960]   How much did you pay for the .co?
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.000]   I paid whatever GoDaddy charged me.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   It was like 10 bucks.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.440]   It was fail.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.080]   So it's only like those special one letter ones.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.920]   Like if you wanted P.CO.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.840]   Yeah, that'd be expensive.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.440]   Well, it's the URL shorter.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.480]   But here's the question.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.160]   Post Twitter-- not that I'm predicting any demise here,
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.960]   but in a plus world, do you need shorter as any more?
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.040]   I don't think so.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.560]   I would be so glad when they die.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.440]   Needless.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.720]   Who wants G.co?
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.920]   Although, please, can Google-- can you bring back
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.240]   their name and the profile?
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.480]   I don't want to be a 643-799-4113-99411.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.160]   That's similar.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.000]   I don't want to do that.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.240]   So you're saying that you know what you are?
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.520]   I am who I am.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.760]   I am not a number.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.400]   I am a free man.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.480]   But it used to work, profiles.google.com/leoloport.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.880]   Doesn't anymore.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.240]   I don't know if they have some privacy issues to nail down
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.840]   there before they can bring that back.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.120]   Well, you used to have a switch, right?
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.720]   So on your profile, you could say, I want my name or not.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.640]   Well, here's a very interesting one on that line
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.280]   is the question of verification.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.600]   And one of the stories in the list
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.440]   is Google's strategy for celebrity acquisition.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.120]   And part of the question for there
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.440]   is how do you verify?
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.720]   And one speculation was that you would fax your private
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.640]   whatever's licensed in, sir.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.680]   I am what I am.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.160]   Well, they--
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.240]   They kicked Bill Shatner off.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.680]   William Shatner said, hey, Google.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.480]   And by the way, it's not Google.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.800]   I don't think it's Google who does this.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.320]   I think it's the users who say, wait, I report this.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.720]   This isn't William Shatner.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.640]   Report it.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.520]   And he got booted off.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.840]   And then I'm sure somebody at Google said, whoops.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.880]   Because he got brought back.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.600]   If you don't have his new gatekeepers,
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.640]   you'll have agents and publishers and studio people
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.120]   like that become the gatekeepers to identity.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.800]   I think Google is so wise to defer celebrities and brands
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.600]   as long as they can.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.360]   Well, here's my soft, Robert Scoble.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.600]   Robert, you're a celebrity.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.560]   You should have waited.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:42.760]   You're a star.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.640]   He's not allowed.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.320]   And then if he gets off, then I could be like number five.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.840]   Mashable, by the way, is still on there.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.880]   Mashable did not get booted.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.480]   I thought they might have.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.520]   But they still have their--
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.000]   Maybe they'll just do the right thing.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.720]   I am holding back.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.440]   So what will happen?
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.280]   Will it be like a special brands area or--
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.040]   I don't know.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.320]   I don't know either.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.000]   I just have to start thinking about it.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.040]   With this notion of ads on Twitter,
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.800]   and I suggest a Bill Gross should do this
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.600]   because they have these clients,
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.320]   I've long wanted to know what's the proportion of tweets
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.400]   that are read, or just simply displayed on a screen.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.840]   We will never know because I don't think Twitter wants us
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.600]   to know that.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.840]   Well, but Twitter is not the one who probably knows it.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.280]   Well, they know from the web.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.160]   Is a client.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.680]   And so if you're going to put an ad in a stream,
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.600]   you have this problem of how much of your audience
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.400]   isn't seeing you.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:37.680]   Right.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.880]   How many impressions do you get?
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.040]   So that's going to be a problem that Twitter
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.920]   has to have architecturally.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.760]   Whereas if you look at Google--
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.080]   look at what Google has done in the past.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.760]   Google completely reinvented advertising.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.480]   This is critical.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.360]   In old media, the advertiser took the risk.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.000]   Would this ad worker not be your problem?
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.920]   In Google Land, when they sold by the click,
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.120]   Google took the risk and Google aligned its interests
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.960]   with the marketer.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960]   And that changed the economics of all advertising
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.800]   and all media right there.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.040]   That was the key thing that happened.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.520]   That's what really changed everything,
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.000]   is they offered a better deal to advertisers.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.800]   Well, so come along with plus.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.680]   First, they're going to prove that people are there.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.480]   It's very active.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.840]   It's a beautiful place.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.760]   And we're in charge.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   It's our space.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.600]   Kind of.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.320]   And so then if you're going to enter in brands,
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   I think-- I'm just betting.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.000]   And I don't know anything about this at all.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.280]   But I'm betting Google's going to invent something that's as new.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.360]   And how do you want to interact with Dell?
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.040]   And how does Dell want to be interacted with with people?
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.400]   You go to things like my Starbucks idea
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.800]   and the Dell forms where people solve each other's problems
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.840]   and those kinds of things.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.680]   You could imagine morphing those functions
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.080]   to a world like this.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.600]   Much higher value, much higher relevance to the user,
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.360]   much better experience.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.480]   I think we're not going to see plain old ads in streams here.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.680]   I could be wrong.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   But I'm going to bet they're going to invent something new
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.160]   for the brands.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.400]   And it'll be worth it for the brands to wait.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.120]   I think you're right.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.480]   One of the things that strikes me about Google+ right now
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.240]   is that it's actually earned the word
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.120]   "social" in social network.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.200]   It's not half in, half out broadcast platform right now,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.640]   Twitter.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.200]   Twitter is really not social.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.520]   No, it's not the same--
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.000]   Is it remote for many anyway?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.040]   And for me, does that because it more accurately
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.440]   models the way I relate to people, the whole circles thing?
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.480]   If they can accurately model a useful way
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.800]   to relate to brands.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.720]   But how would that--
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   I'm trying to think what that would look like.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.280]   I think Jeff's got something with the more
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.880]   like take the support forms.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.800]   You get satisfaction kind of--
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.840]   You walk into a store, you take it to somebody,
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.680]   say this isn't working.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.680]   What's going on?
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.880]   But a brand doesn't intrude on my stream necessarily.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   Right.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.240]   If you seek out the brand or the brand is recommended to you,
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.520]   that becomes incredibly valuable.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.280]   I even look at Blippi, where my favorite story at Blippi,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   and they've pivoted a bit too after I finish the day.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.480]   Are they still around?
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.640]   They are.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.480]   I got a whole damn chapter on Kaplan in there.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.400]   So we better not die.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.800]   His company, I mean.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.720]   But my favorite story from what he tells me
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.320]   is that when Matt Cutz--
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.000]   we've told this before in the show-- bought the Wi-Fi scale.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.320]   And they credit Matt over you, Leo, which may be wrong.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.840]   But in any case, 100 people bought it immediately.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.800]   And if you look at that, that's the future market.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.640]   But now they're a review site.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.160]   Right.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.640]   That's pretty much-- they want content.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.560]   So they've gone to review, and they use the credit card
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.120]   only to be a gateway to reviews.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.480]   Whatever.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.160]   I think if you look at changing the relationship of a company
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:54.280]   to its public on Google+, that's possible.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.960]   The thing is, nobody wants to listen to companies talk
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   about themselves, right?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.680]   It's they'll tell people when companies speak at conferences
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.400]   and what I--
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.440]   Even I'm starting to revolt at the self-promotion
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.800]   that I see on here.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   I almost want to see people use Google+ as a selfless tool.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.000]   Why are you laughing at me?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.080]   Why are we laughing at me?
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.920]   You want to get--
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.120]   --fix up people, human beings, the ability
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.960]   to broadcast information.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.080]   But you don't want it to be about themselves.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.720]   You are crazy.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.320]   I don't know what kind of--
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.680]   I don't mind if it's about themselves.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.520]   But it could be about their unique point of view,
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.000]   but it's like an article.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.440]   But there's so much self-promotion.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.360]   It's like a dinner party.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.960]   You don't want to be talking about yourself all the time.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   And you wouldn't be doing that.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.440]   But you're revealing enough to be interested.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.080]   That's actually how it should be.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.280]   But how do you enforce that as structurally or--
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.760]   This goes right back.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.920]   This is why they open it up to journalists
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.320]   who always want to talk about things.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.480]   And we find ourselves fascinating,
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.720]   because we're peers and colleagues and egotists.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.440]   But when you open it up to the huge scale,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.840]   it is going to be an English self-promotion.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.320]   And that's just an eight.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.360]   I mean, that's what my Facebook is.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.080]   Isn't that a big--
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.280]   this is in a bigger way the challenge
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   of Google+ faces with brands.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.720]   How do you keep something like this compelling and content rich?
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.640]   Not just in the face of brand promotion,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   but in the face of humans.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.760]   This ties in a bit with what Tim Morales has about privacy.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.400]   That all the data is out there.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.200]   The only chance you've got to regulating it
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.880]   is by building social mores into the system.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.440]   So if somehow the system punishes people
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.120]   who incessantly talk about themselves,
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.280]   if it's easy to get rid of them or there's frown on them--
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   How we thought this?
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.160]   Then that's the best.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.480]   We need a new dropdown.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.960]   It doesn't just say a report of use or block this person,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:54.040]   but this person's too self-promotional.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040]   That'd be good.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.320]   When I was in college and I threw a lot of parties,
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.440]   I would always say that I knew I was having good party
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.520]   when there was somebody there that I didn't like
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.000]   and who didn't like me.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.240]   Because that meant my party was so good
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.600]   that it transcended our personal relationship.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.440]   And that's like that Google+ is right on that cusp.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.200]   My party is starting to get full of a lot of people I don't know.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   Well, I'm seeing an interesting trend on Google+
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.000]   to people using this report abuse button against people.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.240]   In fact, Jenny Chardan just said,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.160]   how come Mashable's still in here when ABC is gone?
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.760]   And the first comment is report is fake profile now.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.200]   You know?
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.080]   People will start using vigilante tools.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.080]   I used it this morning.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.040]   I woke up and somebody had shared something to me
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.800]   or having a competition or something.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.640]   And was it a foot nipple?
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640]   It was not.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.800]   Was it Jason Kellogg?
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.760]   I don't think I'd know a foot nipple if I saw him.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.720]   It was probably Jason.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.360]   It was actually really what you were talking about.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.640]   He was giving away.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.280]   And our fake profile go away.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.160]   We're building all this new stuff for the Verge
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.520]   and we're talking about comments and communities.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.680]   It's a huge challenge.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.120]   Huh?
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.320]   It's a huge challenge.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:04.680]   It is.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.840]   And one of the things we took away at Engadget
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.120]   was we took away the downrank buttons.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.600]   And we said, you know what?
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.720]   People are abused.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.800]   We want people to go after the good things.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.040]   They did undig.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.520]   They misused it undig.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:18.880]   Right.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.840]   So we want people to spend their energy promoting good things
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.760]   and spend their energy in a positive way.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.840]   And we'll go through and moderate the bad stuff.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.320]   That's-- we'll take on that role.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.520]   That's our responsibility.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.120]   We want readers to go organically find the good stuff.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   And maybe it worked and maybe it didn't.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.840]   But that was-- I mean, that's our thinking.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.280]   It still kind of is.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.560]   There's all those buttons that let you do something
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.440]   vengeful.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.840]   They're ripe for abuse.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.320]   I mean, the first thing that's going to happen
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   is people are going to use them the wrong way
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   instead of saying, this is really good.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.920]   It's hard-- it's a hard thing to do.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.000]   Eli, let me ask a question.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.280]   Could you imagine with an API out there, right?
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.000]   So you have more control over what you do.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.320]   Could you imagine building Verge not on a website but on plus?
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.200]   What would that look like?
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.840]   So if I was just me, if I was just a guy
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   and I wanted to be a publisher, I had--
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.480]   You're just a guy.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.000]   And if I didn't have any resources
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.560]   and I wasn't part of a company that is actually
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.760]   a technology company, then, yeah, I would say, well,
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.520]   I could-- there's a way for me to focus my energies
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   on specific platforms.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.880]   Because what we think at SB Nation and the Verge
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.080]   is that we can write a WordPress blog, which
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:28.880]   is what we're doing now.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.520]   And it's interesting.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.600]   And we're getting traffic and people like it.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.400]   But what makes it-- what makes the Verge-- what
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.440]   makes that better and good and vital and interesting
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.880]   is how we're going to leverage the technology of the web
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.960]   to make our content new.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.960]   So we're not taking a print magazine
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.720]   and shoving it on the web and saying, well, we're online.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.360]   And so I think the technology informs the publication.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.800]   So if I'm just me, and I say, well,
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.680]   I don't have the ability to build proprietary technology.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.760]   Like I do now, because I'm part of the company.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.120]   Well, yeah, then I could say, well,
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.920]   I want to use Twitter and Facebook and Google+
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.480]   and all these other things in lieu of installing WordPress.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.320]   You could do it.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.760]   I don't know what that would look like.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.960]   But if it was just me and I was driven to do it that way,
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.560]   I could.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.480]   It would-- the question--
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.360]   It probably wouldn't be your first choice
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.240]   for a content delivery system.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.480]   But it sure is valuable for brand building.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.440]   And look what Treckliffe has gained out of it.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.240]   Let me ask Jeff one question back.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.120]   So let's say I do that.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.480]   How do I get paid?
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.920]   Because that's the ultimate question is, fine,
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.800]   I can build an audience.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.000]   I can build an audience anywhere.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.440]   I can take my pants off from the internet
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.320]   and somebody will look at it.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   But how do I get paid for that?
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.760]   I mean, that's the thing--
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.200]   This is where I'm assuming there's an API that lets you draw out
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.640]   your best to present it how you wish,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.760]   but draw people along by using plus.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.400]   Maybe plus is a CMS.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.520]   Getting paid, though, is a different problem.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.680]   It's not.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.680]   Well, I disagree.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.840]   I think-- I disagree.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.920]   I think-- I mean, we do-- everything we do is free,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.800]   and we get paid by advertising.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.840]   So you solve-- you have to solve that getting paid problem.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.160]   I don't disagree with that.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.240]   But I think that no matter what you're doing to make money,
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.200]   you also have to generate an audience in a community.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.320]   And sometimes platforms like this are valuable.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.240]   And then worry-- then you can figure out how to get paid
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.280]   is a separate problem.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.160]   It's not the same.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.640]   There's marketing and there's how to get paid.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.120]   You know, one of the things that I'm very precious about
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.640]   is our editorial integrity, right?
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.960]   And you look at like mommy blogs or some other phenomenon
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.760]   of people becoming massive content producers that
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.160]   didn't have a rich journalistic tradition behind it, right?
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.400]   And it's good.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.480]   I support that.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.800]   But then you read some of them, and they're
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.440]   sponsored by all kinds of companies.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.440]   And their coverage is informed by direct advertiser
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.760]   and advertorial control.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.400]   And that makes me uncomfortable personally.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.920]   Well, I agree with you, but that's going to--
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.600]   So that will out also.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.120]   Right.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.080]   So what I'm saying is if you build a huge audience, right,
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.560]   the way you get paid is by saying things to that audience.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.600]   And you can either say them directly through me.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.720]   Well, Sony sponsored me today.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.800]   Like drink this diet Coke.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.120]   It's delicious, which is that's one way to do it.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.240]   That makes me uncomfortable.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.000]   The other way is to say, well, I'll
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.720]   take this much space on the page,
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.440]   and you can have this stuff around it.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.520]   And I'll have a sales guy, and we'll
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.000]   develop a relationship to actually sell that stuff
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.920]   in the premium instead of I'll paste in Google's code
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.640]   or whatever.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.400]   And you'll just have to ask--
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   You're not going far enough.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.480]   Both those examples are old models of messaging.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.000]   And if you look at-- yes, is Leo messaging?
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.560]   Yes, but we know that Leo only advertises things he trusts,
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.320]   except Chipotle, which has not been smart enough.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.920]   I don't trust him, but I'm hungry.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.760]   I don't even.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.440]   But again, I go back to Google.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.760]   And look what Google did.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.160]   Google didn't go for messaging.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.760]   Google went for relevance in search.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.920]   I think it goes back to what Ed was saying earlier, which
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.320]   I liked a lot too, about the notion of the norms
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.920]   that Google separated out ads from search.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.600]   Now, companies are still in search,
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.040]   but there is a norm about how you're supposed to be there.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.680]   And I watched Matt Cut's video today, one of his developer
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.520]   videos, and somebody asked him and said,
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.560]   if I'm selling the same products on three different sites,
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.880]   but with three different business models and sales models
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.800]   and pricing, are you to consider that spam?
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.440]   And Matt said, well, that's interesting.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.640]   Three, if they're different enough, probably not.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.560]   3,000, yes.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.520]   With 3,000, you don't pay any attention to the one thing
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.160]   that matters.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.440]   So Google is making people do things by the law as code.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.640]   So that's part of what Ed is saying.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.880]   I think, too, is that we've got to watch here
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.600]   and see what are the norms and what are the laws that we're
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.120]   going to see in Emergent here, and where do brands fit into that?
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.080]   And I don't think it's messaging anymore.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.240]   I think it's relationships.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.480]   And I think it's data.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.280]   That's the clue train.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.760]   Get on the clue train.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.280]   That's exactly what the clue train says.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.400]   It says markets are conversations.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.720]   And I think there's an opportunity.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.080]   There's an opportunity for Google.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.760]   It's since it's created a conversation platform
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:09.160]   to invent a new way of communicating with customers.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.720]   But I think what's important to me, as somebody who
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.440]   creates content, is to make sure that what I'm communicating
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.840]   to people is under my control, right?
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.080]   And not directly.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.640]   I don't want to go approve the ads that we run on our site.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.080]   But I want to make sure that there is classy and beautiful
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.760]   and meaningful to people as the content that we actually
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:30.760]   have.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.720]   Well, that's one approach.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.920]   Or you keep it at arm's length is the other approach.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.400]   When you do that, you run into immediate problems.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.000]   So the best example I can think of
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.040]   is the one tiny trip or one tiny trick
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.640]   to lose your belly fat.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.040]   Oh, I hate that ad.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.840]   But those are federated network ads.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.440]   And they're everywhere.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.680]   And that's what happens at arm's length, right?
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.360]   You develop an experience that happens far away
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.200]   from the content producer.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.320]   And this has happened to me personally.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.560]   You wake up one day.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.080]   No, you're right.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.680]   So your beautiful website that you work for,
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.240]   and there's a belly fat ad on it.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.120]   And you have to say to yourself, well, that's the deal.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.000]   That's the bargain.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.280]   I think we just need new models.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.200]   I think that we haven't solved these problems yet.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.320]   But I think that they are soluble.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.080]   We got to run.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.320]   But we have to do a little quick commercial before we run.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.880]   But I also want to say the Google+ message of the week
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.560]   from Jeff Jarvis, Felicia Day does not want you to go
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.200]   to Comic Con without your deodorant kids.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.040]   Please.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.720]   And thank you, Jeff, for finding that.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.680]   Yes.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.440]   If you're at Comic Con, Felicia says,
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.880]   if you're at Comic Con this weekend-- by the way, we are--
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.560]   we'll be covering it.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.000]   Sarah and Tom are down there right now.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.320]   We've got coverage-- when does it coverage start tomorrow?
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.040]   Friday.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.880]   Friday 4 to 6, Saturday 2 to 4.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.720]   And I'm sure they'll be wearing their deodorant.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.800]   There's great comments in there about geeks, dink.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.160]   Oh, Jeff, I have a question for you.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.600]   And that's a hijack again.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.520]   So let's say you somehow managed to monetize a conversation.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.200]   How do you verify the identities within the conversation?
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.480]   How do you say, well, that person
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.000]   isn't being directly paid by Sony to keep patrols out,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.520]   basically?
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.520]   No 100% answer at all.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.440]   I think one thing you do is you control Sony,
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.360]   and you hold some weapon over Sony.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.000]   What I wish Google would do, for example,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.400]   is when spammers come out selling products,
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.720]   Google should go after the ones who make money,
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.320]   including the products themselves.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320]   I think-- stop this.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.960]   I think Google+ does a good job by having a loose-- not a force,
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.520]   but a loose relationship between your actual persona,
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.960]   using Google profiles and what you post on there.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.040]   And really strongly encouraged not to use a handle on here.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.160]   I think that's good.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.560]   I think that's one way to do that, right?
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.200]   And there's the wisdom of crowds.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.640]   People can spot a shell a mile off.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.280]   Exactly.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.880]   And trust the audience.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.160]   I agree.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:49.520]   I agree.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.600]   We know immediately, don't we?
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.040]   We know it in our guts.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.080]   All right, I do have to take a break and be a shill for a moment.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.880]   Only briefly to remind everybody.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.120]   Look, it's easy to sell Netflix.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.160]   Just go to Netflix.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   I don't have to sell this.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.040]   You know what I watched last night, which I really liked?
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.560]   I never heard of this guy Bill Hicks.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.000]   Really?
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:10.600]   What?
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.600]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:11.880]   I'm shocked.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.840]   Well, he died in '94.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.120]   Somehow I missed his career.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.560]   But many people say he was the greatest comedian
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.200]   or one of the greatest comedians of his time.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.800]   So there's a great documentary on here made by his family,
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.600]   which I really loved.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.760]   Now, this is an example of something I would never have seen.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.040]   I would not have ordered the DVD.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.640]   I would not have found it a movie store.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.200]   But on Netflix, watch instantly.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.680]   It's so cool.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.960]   You browse around.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.920]   And I had an hour or two to kill last night.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.000]   And as usual, I found something really thought provoking
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   and interesting.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.680]   I also watched Chuck Barris' "Convections of a Dangerous Mind."
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.960]   That is just weird.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.080]   Lots of great stuff here.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.240]   $7.99 a month for unlimited.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.160]   This is the future.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.280]   I'm telling you.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.840]   And yeah, I mean, there's movies.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.040]   There's TV shows.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.360]   I was watching "Star Trek," the original series.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.760]   Man, does that look good now?
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.160]   This new high def version of it that they've created?
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.440]   Just for this.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.840]   I love it.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.800]   That's all I have to say.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.440]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.400]   OK, you're already a member.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.880]   OK, that's not going to be any good.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.160]   Tell your mom, your dad, your friends,
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.200]   your non-tech savvy folks in your life what a great thing
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:19.840]   Netflix is.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.120]   They will thank you for it.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.080]   And if you send them to Netflix.com/twit,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.560]   I will personally come to your home and smooch you.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.680]   On the lips or not, you get to choose Netflix.com.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.240]   There's something I can't really live up to, actually.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.000]   Does that make it a lie?
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.040]   No, because you know better.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.840]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.480]   Ed Dumble, I really want to thank you for being here today.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.280]   It's really nice to have you.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:47.960]   It's been great fun.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.720]   Thank you.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:53.680]   O'Reilly Media, media.arReilly.com/bed.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.840]   Yeah, right now it's under RReilly.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.720]   I'm sorry, RReilly.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.040]   See, I did that again.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.560]   And tell us about O'Reilly.com.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.600]   It's coming up next weekend.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   It's coming up next week in Portland.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.880]   We'll be there for five days in the convention center.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.720]   Over 500, 600 speakers.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.160]   It's the gathering of the tribes.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.200]   It really is the open source convention.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.840]   And as program chair, you must be having a great time
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.920]   getting people like John O'Bacon, Tim Berglund.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.360]   That means so much fun.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:20.880]   It's huge.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.480]   It's wonderful to be able to get up.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.520]   You get up there on stage and you are odd because everyone
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.200]   is around you.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:26.680]   That's really neat.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.560]   It's such an honor.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.760]   Glad you could be here.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.400]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, my friend.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:38.480]   My number of the week is $54.91.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.880]   A site called WordStream trying to figure out
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:46.240]   the 20 most valuable ad words on Google.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.240]   And ran a whole bunch of words against it
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.960]   and one of the methodology is on their site.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.440]   But they said the number one word is insurance.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.480]   Followed by other illogical words like loans, mortgage,
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.160]   and so on.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.120]   The top 20 is all they list.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.720]   The bottom three, don't speak well for America,
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.600]   rehab, treatment, and cord blood.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   Cord blood at 2780.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.200]   That's gross.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:12.680]   Wow.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.080]   Has nipple foot in there anywhere?
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.640]   It will be now because of the power of real.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.680]   No, I'm instructing your guys to write at XCO bait nipple
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.920]   foot headline right now.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.560]   You better not.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.400]   I'm counting on you.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.880]   You know, I bet you you get nipplefoot.co.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.000]   It's available.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.720]   The other thing I want to mention real quick is I saw that number
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.360]   one, somebody told me in Twitter that there's a gift
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.920]   stopper for Chrome Plus.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.200]   I mean, for Google Plus.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.760]   And number two, I just saw right before we went on Harvey
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.560]   Levin from TMZ is on here.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.400]   And he's already saying, wow, people are following me like crazy.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.360]   So everybody go find Harvey Levin and shock him
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.560]   with how much bring him the power of Leo and say you're there
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.400]   because Leo essentially--
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.520]   Is he worth following?
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.360]   I think he'll have lots of interesting gossip and stuff.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.800]   And I just proposed him as the new CEO of News Corp.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.280]   Wow.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.440]   It's L-E-V-I-N if you want to follow the right one.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.720]   TMZ for all of you, yeah.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.080]   I'm a lawyer.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.560]   It looks like a lawyer.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.280]   Actually, this is good.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:16.920]   I'm going to add him.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:17.200]   Let's see.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.440]   I have some circles.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.960]   Celebs, companies, creators, designers, entrepreneurs.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:22.480]   All right.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.720]   We're seeing Leo circles.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.080]   You have funny Googlers, Ham's, journalists.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.000]   My name is Eric Sperks.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.900]   I'm meant to tell you, Ed, I had a reporter
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:33.960]   who called me this week from a media outlet to be unnamed.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.880]   Who is whole thesis and his boss's whole thesis was that--
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.120]   Well, Facebook is about friendship because you
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:40.880]   friend people there.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.200]   And all you are on Google+ is acquaintances
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.840]   because that's what they say.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.840]   I said, no, you dip.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.000]   It's just a word.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.080]   I'm a follower.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.360]   It was still the lead of the story.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.520]   Yeah, of course.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.560]   Of course.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.040]   Of course.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.080]   Niele, Niele, anything you want to plug?
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.040]   Theverge.com.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.880]   What is--
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.320]   Yes.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.280]   Yes.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.440]   Go to the Verge sign up for our archaic email alerts.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.640]   Maybe I'll send you a sponsored message on Google+.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.800]   And yeah, this is my next.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.760]   We're still going to be doing it for until we launch.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.720]   So the Mac mini review will be up this week.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.560]   The Macbook Air review will be up this week.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.840]   You know, I'm sad because I actually love this is my next.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.440]   I read it all the time now.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.840]   But I'm sure the Verge will just be this plus.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.800]   It will be-- yes, we're actually just
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.600]   going to call it this is my next plus.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.560]   And I thought it would be good.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.200]   I'm excited.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.280]   I have to say, working with this team,
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.520]   we have a lot of ideas about what to do,
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.880]   how to make our project bigger and better.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.400]   And when you work in a gadget,
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.920]   like in gadget for a long time, you only dream
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.480]   about what you could do with additional tools and technology.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   And hey, we're doing it.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.400]   You were talking about TMZ, Jim Bankoff, our CEO,
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   at Espionage.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.960]   He started TMZ with Harvey at AOL.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.040]   I mean, he knows how to build big things.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.440]   And I'm excited.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.400]   It's exciting to work with him and build
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.600]   this thing that we're doing.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.640]   Can we follow you on Google+?
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   Is that OK?
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.200]   Yes, I will start to post on Google+ if you guys are all.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.240]   I've been very lax about it.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.000]   Well, there's no way to make money on it.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.600]   Yeah, I only monetize it.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.680]   But you can make gifts.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.880]   This Diet Coke is so delicious.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.080]   But there's only pay you for that.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   I want to wrap this thing up because we've gone long enough.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.800]   This was our last broadcast from the Twitcottage.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.200]   I do invite you all to take a look at the new place online.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.000]   We've got a little live cam up there.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.480]   B-I-T dot L-Y slash drop cam.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.320]   And if you haven't yet purchased a brick,
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.160]   you could sure help us out.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.520]   We've sold over 1,000 of them.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.360]   We're really glad to say we're going to have a wall of honors.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.280]   You come in.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.760]   You'll see your brick up there along
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.640]   with a lot of other great bricks.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.000]   If you go to bricks.twit.tv, you can become a part of the Twit
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:05.800]   Brickhouse Studios.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.600]   I'm telling you, somebody buying dipplefoot.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.880]   It will haunt the old forever.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.280]   That would really be funny if every day is like, oh, to work.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.600]   Because I have to walk by that wall.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.160]   Every day.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.160]   And you know my eye is going to go straight to that.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.960]   Straight to that.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.360]   So we will be over there Sunday night.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.920]   Sunday afternoon, actually 3 p.m. is our first show.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.680]   And then this week in Google will be, as always,
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.640]   Wednesday, 11 a.m.

[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.280]   You don't have to go anywhere else,
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.560]   but we will be in the new facility and looking great, I think.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.720]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.080]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
