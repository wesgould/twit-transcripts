[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.360]   Dude, you're a barista.

[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760]   to show the covers of Google, and not just Google,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.680]   the cloud, Twitter, Facebook.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.040]   All of that stuff.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.640]   Gina Trapani is here from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.480]   I can smell the apple pie cooking.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.520]   I know it's pretty turkey twig.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640]   The appetizing oven, the turkey's brining.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640]   Good day.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.120]   You know, though, I bet you miss--
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.640]   I don't know.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.440]   Maybe you don't.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.240]   Brooklyn Italian Thanksgiving.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   I do.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.800]   We did the traditional American meal growing up
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.400]   at Thanksgiving.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.120]   Christmas, though.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   Christmas Eve is when we get crazy.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120]   We do the seven fish meal, Sicilians of a fish meal.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.240]   So yeah, I miss my mom's pasta, because you know,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.320]   there's pasta at every meal.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   Yeah, and Thanksgiving, we would have the traditional--
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.800]   not me, but Italian types.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.360]   I'm Italian, but we didn't ever do this,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.280]   but I wish we had.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.360]   You have the traditional turkey and everything else,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   but you have like five extra courses with pasta
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   and any pasta and all that stuff,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   because you're not full enough.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.320]   My mom's any pasta.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.080]   Oh, me too.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   Maybe I should catch a flight.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080]   Cappagool, and you got your salami, your genoa.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.680]   Oh, man.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.360]   Man.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720]   I'm eating whole foods tonight, because of you, Leah.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   That's my fault.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.200]   My fault.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440]   Is there a good Italian deli in San Diego?
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.360]   That's what you need.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.320]   There's-- yeah, there is a little Italy in San Diego,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.120]   but I'll tell you the truth.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   I save it for when I go back to Brooklyn.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   I, you know, I'm a snob about pizza and bread
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.920]   and fresh ones that I'll hear.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160]   It's like you can't have bagels in California.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.840]   No.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.480]   No, or pizza.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.520]   We had this conversation.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.880]   Sarah Lane, she denies it.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.080]   She said, no, we have excellent pizza.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.240]   It's cornmeal crust, and I'm saying, that's not pizza.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.720]   That's not pizza.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.920]   That's a nice baked good, but it's not pizza.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.440]   Right.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.040]   It's a bit of--
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.960]   It's a bit of a leafy street.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   It's the heretic of pizza, a duck sausage pizza
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   with the downfall.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160]   It was the shark pizza that jumped over the pizza or something.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.480]   That's Jeff Jarvis, sharking himself.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.800]   He's at home, obviously taking a little time off,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.480]   but normally he's a professor at City University of New York.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.240]   I want to ask you about CUNY, because I
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560]   know there has been some protests there
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.400]   and some issues going on there, too,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.240]   as with many universities across the country.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.320]   He's also the author of a fabulous new book called
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.600]   Public Parts About Living in Public.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.320]   And it's benefits.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.440]   Thanks for being here, Jeff.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   Do you smell any turkey cooking in your house?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560]   No, we're having friends over tomorrow,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520]   and it's a culinary-- my wife, it was her idea,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.360]   and I can't cook.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.120]   I had boys and people.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.200]   And she said, oh, I'll work on it,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.360]   because they have one is kosher, one is vegetarian,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   and one can't eat starch, vinegar, or other things.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   And one is picky.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.320]   What?
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.240]   Only one?
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   OK.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.080]   I don't know what we're having tomorrow.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.400]   I think we're having scrambled eggs.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.560]   Scrambled eggs.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   I think so.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.640]   Which was the original title for Paul McCartney's yesterday,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   by the way, scrambled eggs.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.000]   All I want to do is scramble-- that's actually true.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   He wrote the melody without a lyric,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.840]   and he just vamped using the word scrambled eggs.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.080]   Trivia that's completely useless.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.000]   You learn something every day here.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   That guy with the beard ceiling cat over here
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.160]   is actually Dan Patterson.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.880]   Oh, hi.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.080]   Oh, hi.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.360]   He's a frozen picture today because his time
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.000]   Warner cable sucks.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.520]   So we couldn't get a Skype video and audio,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.080]   but we used to be sound good.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.800]   Well, you know, that's what matters, right?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   Yeah, that's all it matters.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.640]   We only send people pictures because they demand it.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   And because we have such a beautiful studio.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.440]   Silly audience.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.200]   Silly audience.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.240]   Dan, formerly with ABC Radio News,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.120]   now you're starting your own podcasting business,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.640]   Damn Your Eyes.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.360]   Yep, that is correct.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.680]   I have decided that I should stop talking about the revolution
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   and start joining it.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   So we're not doing technology focus,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.320]   but we're doing world, political, and business news
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.160]   for technology.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.560]   Awesome.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   So-- Oh, in that case, Lee will bring your picture back.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   OK.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.560]   Now you can have a video.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   No, actually, I'm always thrilled when I hear people doing it
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.400]   because I think that this is ripe for transformation,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   the media business.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.960]   But what scares me is that there are only a handful of us
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.120]   doing this.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.440]   And it's not good to be the only person in a category.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.840]   That scares everybody, including listeners, advertisers,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.720]   and me.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.800]   So I welcome--
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.320]   Well, you do.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.360]   --validate that this is an absolutely essential medium.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.960]   I think so.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.040]   And good content is medium agnostic.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   So you can do this as a podcast or a TV show or a video show.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.240]   It's quality people will come.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   Do you have a name for the new business?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.920]   Well, there's a corporation.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   It's called Co-Point.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.560]   But again, this doesn't need to be a plug
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.280]   for this.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.560]   We'll have several shows that start around the first of the year.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   And I will be on the presidential campaign.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.960]   This is my core competition.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.480]   Oh, how exciting.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.120]   This is--
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.480]   Dan, this is huge because you did a lot with Occupy Wall Street.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.000]   And I wondered, in fact, as you were doing this,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.040]   how ABC News felt because you really were freelancing on this.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.800]   Well, nobody cared.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.280]   I would cover that.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520]   And frequently, I would talk to you.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.680]   And I would send Jeff messages on Google+
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.800]   and this community cared.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.600]   The technology community cared.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.360]   I would send it to my editors and crickets, crickets.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.640]   So there's an audience, but that audience may not be--
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.720]   well, I don't need to say disparaging things.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.040]   All roses and sunshine.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.400]   Yeah, no, that's exciting.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   And so followed Dan Patterson on Google+, of course,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.400]   where you'll see the same beautiful picture of him.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.360]   And find out more about what he is involved with there.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.320]   Google+ Dan Patterson with two T's.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.080]   So let's talk about the week in Google News,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.480]   starting off with more funeral music,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.920]   as Google kills even more stuff.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:10.800]   Jeff Jarvis on the mouth trumpet.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.360]   I don't think you wanted to say that.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.960]   So Wave was already dead, but they're actually officially
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.400]   killing it.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.840]   I don't understand that, Gina.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.480]   Wait, what is this?
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.440]   The steak through the heart?
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   Yeah, they just had to re-- they had to re-announce it.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.360]   Just to remind us.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.880]   I'm not dead yet.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.600]   Yes, I am.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.840]   You know, they announced that they were stopping development,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.600]   but they were just kind of keeping it around for a few months,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.800]   which turned into a whole year.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   Now they're saying that wave.google.com will no longer exist.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.800]   And you won't be able to write to Waves
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   after the first of the month.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.440]   And you should export your Waves.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   Wow.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   I think everyone who used Wave is pretty well-warned and aware.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.120]   The rest, Muslims moved on, right?
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.440]   They're not still at Google.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.200]   The guys who did Wave, Google maps before that.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.640]   Well, ours is at Facebook now.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.600]   I'm not sure what his brother's doing.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.680]   But yeah.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.560]   And most of the Wave team has disbanded
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   and moved on to other things.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.160]   Kill by app, will ya?
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.760]   Go to Facebook.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.840]   How do you feel about that?
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.320]   TechCrunch is reporting that, in addition to these products,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   Google is also, at the very least, downsizing,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.320]   if not cutting a lot of their green tech initiatives.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.600]   This is a little disappointing.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.520]   Well, what they're doing then is they're
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.440]   going to kill all of their internal development
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.880]   that they were doing, but keep up
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.760]   on the external investments.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.840]   And this has been a ying yang in terms of Google.org.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.520]   Because Google.org originally started by deciding
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.160]   that we're investing outside things.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.360]   And then they got the technology hubris to say,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.320]   well, we can do a better job.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.360]   So they did a lot of this effort in-house.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.000]   And now they're turning back around again in this focus thing.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.720]   It occurs to me that under Larry-- the irony of this
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.240]   is that under Eric Schmidt, he was the adults of provision,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.040]   but under Larry, Google's becoming a grown-up company.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.280]   It is really interesting.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.080]   I find these products to be really satisfying.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.280]   Yeah, we all knew that Nala wasn't working.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.440]   It makes complete sense that it's not there.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.080]   And we all knew that Buzz and Wave and Google+
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.720]   and all the social stuff in Reader was all redundant.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.560]   And it's very clear that they're going with Plus.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.400]   So it makes sense to trim the rest of these things.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.080]   So I'm not sad about any one of these in this announcement.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.040]   I think that they all make complete sense.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.760]   Have you ever seen this series of--
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.440]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   Go ahead.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   Go ahead.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.040]   Go down.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440]   This really communicates self-confidence
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.160]   that Google knows what it is and why it exists.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   And the 10 years prior to this, we
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.840]   all knew what Google did.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.040]   But we didn't really know why it existed.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.280]   And now this focus is communicating to the world, look,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.920]   we are doing this and we are confidently pursuing this.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.360]   We're not just washing, really wagging in this direction.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.080]   Yeah, although some things--
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.440]   for instance, saying, OK, what was it?
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.000]   Was it Nala?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.040]   Use Google+ instead?
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.760]   But some things Google+ doesn't do, right?
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.680]   Or Google Reader.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.800]   Google Reader.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.240]   And Google-- oh, no, even more Google Connect, which I
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.280]   was using in my blog.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   That was the--
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.840]   Oh, Friend Connect.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.040]   Friend Connect.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.640]   They said, well, just use Google+,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.000]   but it doesn't do the same thing at all, really.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.960]   Right, right.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.800]   And the Google Reader functionality
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.000]   is not completely available on Google+ either.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.480]   So they are making something-- and we talked to Matt Howie
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.960]   about that and was pretty upset about it, because it's
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.040]   something that he used a lot.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   So yeah, with the conversation--
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   Are they laying off people with this?
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.880]   That's a good question.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.280]   I don't know.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.480]   They're also getting rid of people when
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   they get rid of people.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.760]   Beyond the ones who leave because you killed my app,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.720]   this isn't a cost-coming thing in any way, is it?
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.080]   Sounds like it's a focus thing.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.120]   Yeah, I think the right--
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.200]   Because they still need the talent.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.480]   They're still probably hiring talent.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.640]   I would bet.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.000]   I would bet.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.360]   So Google Bookmarks-- this is-- what's really interesting
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.280]   is as you read this list, a lot of people
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.200]   are going to go, huh?
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.960]   What?
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.840]   They did that.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.800]   Google Bookmarks lists.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.920]   Google Friend Connect.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.840]   Google Gears.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.880]   Well, we already knew that was gone.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.560]   Google Search Timeline.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.840]   That was a graph of history.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.800]   I liked this.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.000]   But--
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.280]   It was kind of nice.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.840]   Graph history required any maintenance, but fine.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.200]   Well, but you want to keep the Search Results page simple,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.640]   right?
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.680]   Ah, yes, you're right.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.920]   And you can still go to google.com/trends
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.360]   if you want to see that.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   And they still have the N-gram viewer, which
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.720]   I'm sure they'll call any data.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.320]   Google Wave, Nol, which was their--
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.960]   I guess their Wikipedia.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.880]   They started that about four years ago.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.800]   Nol will work until April 30, 2012.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.600]   You can download your Nols.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.480]   See, there's a problem right there, by the way.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:45.880]   What?
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.440]   My what?
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.640]   Your Nols.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.200]   My what?
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.080]   Your K-N-O-L-S, your Nols.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.760]   It sounds like something out of World of Warcraft.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.560]   You can download your Nols to a file
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.880]   or migrate them to WordPress.com.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.640]   Yeah, well, they're partnering with these two other companies
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.600]   to move the NOL functionality onto a WordPress-based platform.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.560]   They're working with Solvitar and Crowd Favorite
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.920]   to create annotum.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.520]   Annotum, A-N-O-Tum.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.760]   Annotum, which is--
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   At least that's open source, right?
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.920]   Right, and it's based on WordPress.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.440]   So I guess that's why they have some--
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.600]   they're cozy with WordPress, so they're
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.640]   familiar with the format.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.200]   So that makes sense.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.400]   And that's what you're talking about.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.880]   Side wiki and Nol on this show have been representative
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.920]   of these 20% projects or side projects that no one used.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.120]   That we talked about one show and that we'd ever brought up
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.600]   again.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.680]   Is there anything left in the Google product list
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.920]   that we think should have been cut?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Are they killed labs?
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   That's why I was about that, right?
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.000]   They killed labs.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.360]   But I think you have to do that.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.720]   And I think you're exactly right.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.760]   It's a focus issue.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.640]   And Apple's a good example of a company that just said,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.280]   we're going to make these eight products or whatever.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   It's not even that many.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.600]   Four products.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.040]   And that's--
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.200]   focuses, right?
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.640]   Well, there's a certain orchid.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.280]   The orchid is no longer number one in Brazil.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.240]   Even in Brazil.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.680]   Yeah, even in Brazil.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.120]   Oh, no, Facebook goes.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.880]   And it does sound like a pretty redundant with Google+.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.280]   They'll kill that, right?
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.840]   Well, but here's the problem there.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.760]   And this happened years ago when my daughter was
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.160]   on the American Girls site.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.920]   And Mattel killed it.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.080]   And the problem is that once you start a community,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.600]   it's not your community anymore to kill.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.800]   It's the communities.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.600]   And so orchid is the communities.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   And there's some responsibility that follows there.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.880]   That you've gotten people into it.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.080]   They've got their connections there.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.000]   They're addicted to it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.600]   And then sorry, Rog, Paul.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.320]   Well, I think, Jeff, while I would absolutely
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.280]   agree that that is the correct way to proceed,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.040]   I think it is still good.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.080]   And that's actually one of the core issues
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.480]   of putting so much of your trust and your brains, your smarts,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.360]   your energy, your creative output
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.480]   into a system that you don't control that--
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.000]   I know.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.600]   This is Google's to kill.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.680]   But that's the web now.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.440]   I mean, unless you own your own lamp server
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.000]   and running WordPress.org, that's the web.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.520]   I mean, how many people have Tumba logs, WordPress.com logs,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.080]   bloggers logs?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   Right, it's a discussion of principle, I think.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.760]   In local government, opens a park,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.040]   and then decides to close the park,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.400]   because I just don't want one anymore,
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.600]   and one of all the little kitties do.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.720]   This is common space.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.480]   This is a new tragedy of the commons.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.440]   Well, I think that's the misconception, though,
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.840]   is that this is a common space, right?
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.600]   But it's a common space that is owned and controlled
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   and operated privately.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.240]   And so without the ability to take that and go--
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.840]   and of course, there is Google takeout.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.400]   But one of the things that they really, really need to do
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.480]   is stress how you can do something with this data
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.320]   once you've taken it out.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   And we make the mistake of saying, well, it's a common space.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.440]   It's our community.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.000]   We can do what we want here.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.880]   And a company comes along and says, no, we own and operate this.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.120]   Get out.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.920]   But Dan, I mean, I agree with the reality check.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.880]   But what I'm trying to say is something different,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.840]   that I think that we have the opportunity on a lot of things,
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   like net neutrality and other principles,
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.760]   to hold a company to a principle.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.720]   And at some point, if a company creates a community,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.160]   creates something we depend upon.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.720]   And if they go bankrupt, they go bankrupt.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   That's life.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.200]   But if they decide to toy with you and just do it,
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.520]   I think they need to suffer more ire than they do.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.720]   I was very mad at it.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.960]   That's the only words we have, right?
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.680]   Is that if you break this trust relationship with us,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.080]   your community, we may not come back.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.680]   But you can only do that if you have leverage.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   Yeah, well, I think--
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.760]   look at delicious Yahoo, let it languish,
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.200]   and what nowhere was going to kill it.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.480]   And then people came along and got it.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.360]   And Yahoo let them.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   I guess I would just say that this is a lesson learned
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.160]   for all of us.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.680]   And it's not a bad reminder to have
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.280]   that most of the stuff we do on the internet,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.240]   we don't own or control.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.640]   It's our content.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.840]   But Twitter, Facebook--
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.880]   99% of what people do on the internet
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.360]   is owned by an individual corporation.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.520]   I mean, that's why I liked the idea of diaspora.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.160]   I don't know if it's going to go anywhere,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.400]   because it was federated.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   That's why I liked the idea.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.120]   The other things I-- for this reason,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.560]   I preferred status net, for instance,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:45.080]   identical over Twitter, diaspora over Facebook,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.680]   Linux over any-- and it's like--
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.200]   it's nice.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.360]   It's politically and philosophically nice to say,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.080]   it should be open.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.920]   It should be distributed.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.960]   No one should own it.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   But it doesn't work or something.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yeah, it just doesn't.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.920]   It's just not easy for regular people.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.080]   There's not an easy way to set up federated nodes,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.880]   a federated network.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.560]   And get the kind of users that you get at Twitter or Facebook.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.160]   We deal with this and think up all the time.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.280]   After the think of 1.0, release everyone said,
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.520]   well, no one has a server.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.720]   And it's like, well, I mean, we could start a hosting company.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.920]   We could have a hosted solution that sucks in all your data
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.720]   and host it for you.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   But that doesn't solve any of the problems.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.560]   In a perfect world, each of us would
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.760]   have our own LAMP stack server in the closet
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.720]   and run all of our stuff.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.800]   But then time Warner will come along
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.720]   and we'll be able to get to it because there's no bandwidth,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.240]   right then?
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.480]   That's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.760]   I don't have a server in the closet,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.240]   but I have a server--
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.360]   I have hard drives and I serve--
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.840]   everything is backed up to those.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   And I serve my own WordPress site from there.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.080]   Now, right.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.320]   But I do the same thing with my blog.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.520]   It's a WordPress site and SoftLayer is a web hosting company
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.120]   that I'm on.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.920]   But I'm also-- well, I guess if SoftLayer went belly up,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.280]   I could just take a move it to another hosting company.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   So they don't have their fingers in that pie.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.240]   We're all interdependent.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.520]   You can't help but be interdependent.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.040]   Right.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.880]   You're not an island.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.960]   But Dan's point about Google offers Google takeout.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.440]   So great.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.560]   So I export my data and Facebook gives you export to HTML.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.200]   Then what?
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.720]   Then what?
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.080]   It's basically useless without being connected to the community.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.360]   Hey, I've got a bunch of--
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   I've got a massive XML file.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.920]   Right.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.400]   Or even--
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.040]   Also, an HTML file with your assets,
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.160]   so the images, the video, the audio,
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.360]   in different places, in different folders.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.680]   So trying to find something that'll recompile that
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.320]   so you can import it to where--
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.640]   But that's not their fault.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.880]   I mean, I think-- I mean, with all due respect,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.480]   I mean, there's only so much we can expect.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.080]   They at least give it to you.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.520]   And then if you're a true geek, you
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.680]   can write your own routines to make something out of it
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.160]   or somebody else can.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.520]   You know, tumbler or somebody could create a routine to import it.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.800]   I mean--
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   Well, is it really Google's job to make it usable
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   in some other form?
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.960]   It isn't.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.800]   But it sort of reveals the flaw.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.040]   I mean, it's great to say, hey, we liberate your data.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.560]   It's kind of a mess.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.240]   But the reality of your data liberation
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.960]   is why it's a nice XML file.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.320]   I just don't want fits to yell at me.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.280]   That's all.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.800]   No, I admire and honor what they do with the data
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.880]   liberation front.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.720]   Well, I do do it.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.880]   Yeah, I absolutely do.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.360]   I was asked when I gave my spiel about--
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.800]   --at Google in New York.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.920]   Jeff has just held up his public parts.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.120]   I don't want to say it out loud.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.160]   Somebody said, OK, someone asked, what do we do about this?
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   And I said, that's the moment when you say good questions
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160]   so you can buy yourself time to go for an answer.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.280]   And I think what we do is we do create more and more and more
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.160]   open source things.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.720]   We need more Apaches and more, even though I use Chrome,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.080]   I always know that Firefox is there.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.360]   Wikipedia is there.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.200]   And it makes me wonder that if you were a foundation
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.000]   or someone like that, the investment in helping
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.320]   to support a Mozilla is minuscule to nothing.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.200]   This goes to Clay Shurkey's cognitive surplus thing,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.080]   where if you have the right people who really
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.040]   know what they're doing, what could we build?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.400]   It also excites me about the notion that a hashtag now
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   cuts across platforms.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.680]   And you can move it.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.880]   We do have to worry about this architecture, absolutely.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.920]   We're talking about Google, the cloud, architecture,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.280]   federation, all the important things in life.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.520]   This show covers.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.560]   And that's because we've got such smart panelists.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.960]   Of course, Dan Patterson joining us.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.640]   I want to say from Dan Patterson.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.320]   That's where he's from.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.120]   What's your website?
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.320]   The internet from the internet.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.480]   Dan Patterson.com.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:42.920]   There you go.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.480]   From Dan Patterson.com.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.600]   That's all I need to say.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.680]   Jeff Jarvis of the City University of New York
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.280]   at Public Parts.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.520]   That doesn't sound right either.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.640]   And Jean H. Trampani of smarter word.org
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.000]   and think up app.com in a bit.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.640]   I'm going to receive some affirmation,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.320]   some personal affirmation, for my opinion,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.400]   from a major celebrity.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   But first, a word from Ford.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.320]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.200]   You've got to go there and find out more about what
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.640]   Ford is up to.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.080]   We talk about all of the great things that Ford Sync does.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.480]   You could talk to your car like Siri.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.000]   You could tell it to call somebody.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.040]   You could tell it what music to play, what temperature
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.000]   to make the car.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.960]   You could tell it to say, where's the nearest gas station?
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.160]   What are the best gas prices?
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.200]   But I've always forget to say the most important thing.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.360]   And by the way, it's a great GPS that really
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.640]   gets you where you're going.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.560]   It's the best I've ever used in any car.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.800]   And I've used them all.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.960]   Stand alone or car.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.560]   This is the best.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.720]   You've got a nice big screen in the center console.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.680]   It tells you where you're going.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.440]   You even get with my Ford Touch arrows behind the wheel.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.240]   So you don't have to look down.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.080]   It talks to you.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.920]   It says, turn left here.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.960]   And then the arrow shows up.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.160]   I mean, there's some really nice features to this.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.560]   They've also added-- and I like this--
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.360]   in Sync services, they've added a home online account.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.520]   So for the first time, your car has a web page, basically.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.080]   Actually, with Sync My Ride.com, you always
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.680]   had a web page.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.360]   So this is even more.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.040]   This is Sync services, something new.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.120]   For instance, you could be using Google Maps or MapQuest
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.880]   and send your destination to your web host.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.120]   You don't have to-- to the car's website.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   And then from there, to the car.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.760]   So you know, oh, yeah, I'm going to be going here.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.600]   And you send it.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.880]   And the car picks it up.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.640]   They've got now a new database with over 40 million
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.000]   businesses, everybody's in there, including telephone
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.200]   number and directions.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.080]   So all you have to do is call up the business
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.840]   and it'll say you want to call it.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.680]   It's very easy to use.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.720]   And they have an app for Android and iPhone
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.200]   that lets you manage this account and even send yourself
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.840]   traffic alerts.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.240]   So you say, well, I'm going to be going home later today.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.680]   And your phone will text you if the traffic's getting bad.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.320]   I mean, things like this are just awesome.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.480]   They've really got to focus on consumer electronics.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.160]   And you can find out more about it, of course,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.400]   Ford dealer drive that 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.600]   It's got all the doohiggies, all the features.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   Or visit Ford.com/technology, a great website
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.560]   with descriptions and videos on everything
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.760]   we're talking about, like that great EcoBoost engine
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.560]   that gives you the fuel efficiency and performance
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.440]   you're looking for, the electric vehicle.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.600]   That's next in my Ford future, that Ford 2012 Focus
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.160]   electric, the hybrids, the plug-in hybrids, safety,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.040]   security, connection.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   It's all there, Ford.com/technology.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.280]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.120]   So I told you last week I was talking to Pubcom, formerly
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.400]   webmaster world big SEO convention.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.040]   And I said, Google is dead.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.080]   I said Siri and other technologies
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.200]   are going to re-intermediate search.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.480]   And I don't think-- because of social search
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.280]   and technologies like that, there's
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.800]   not a whole lot of future-- and they hated me,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.280]   because they've spent their whole last four years figuring out
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.960]   how to optimize for Google.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.720]   Well, I'm not alone.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.640]   Look, Dexter agrees.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.360]   There might be a little profanity in this.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.680]   Listen, carefully to Dexter.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.800]   Not much I can do with any term, puppy dog watching my every moment.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.320]   You know, Google's kind of five minutes ago, right?
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.080]   Try Elliot.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.440]   Elliot, it's the new Google.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.760]   It's targeted algorithm to aggregate content
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.560]   enough that you can triple-file that's TPS.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.040]   The term puppy dog has skills.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.320]   Google's so five minutes ago, try Elliotsearchengine.com.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.440]   So five minutes ago.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.760]   Isn't that hysterical?
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   Yes.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.520]   What's funnier to me is what we have in the rundown of it.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.600]   Is this someone that gets self-righteously bad about it?
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.600]   He says, "uses an algorithm to aggregate content
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.720]   without getting tripped up by SEO BS."
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.440]   Well, I'm in trouble.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.760]   Actually, now I have to say Robert Lloyd-Louis, who produces
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.600]   Dexter, is a big fan.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.080]   And I wouldn't be surprised if Robert just stuck that in there
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.680]   for me.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.600]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.480]   No, I'm sure he didn't.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.520]   This show was written.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.600]   I'm sure long before.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.080]   Well, it's that TV conflation of SEO with spam.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   Right.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.840]   Well, you know what, Gina?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   Yes and no.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.040]   OK.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.560]   Yes and no.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.120]   Two illustrations.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.680]   One.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.560]   Some media sites I know go so nutty about trying to get page views,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.920]   page views, page views, and use SEO that they lose.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.360]   This is the discussion we have with Leo.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   A post I started writing and never did.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.080]   But you can grow too big.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.880]   Leo is too smart for that.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.160]   And he grows twit to the size of actual relevance
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.280]   and people caring about it as opposed to junk traffic.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.120]   That's example one.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.600]   Example two.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.320]   I was just looking for a doctor for specialty.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   It is impossible to find anybody.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.040]   Now, first, because doctors are idiots
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.960]   and they don't create web pages and they don't create blogs
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.480]   and that's their professional mistake.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.240]   But even within that then, all you have is SEO bait.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.600]   You have, you know, list is directories of doctors
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   that actually tell you absolutely nothing.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.560]   One after another after another.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.160]   So it's the fact that SEO created this industry
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.400]   of baiting SEO.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.240]   That's the problem.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.480]   Now, is that the search engines fault?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.080]   That cuts?
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.640]   No, it's not.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   Don't worry.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.280]   I'm not going to say that math.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.720]   But it is the result of the phenomenon
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.640]   of being able to bait the search engine.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.040]   Well, that's exactly it.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.440]   Right.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.600]   Search and the rules of search are like a framework.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.040]   Kind of like, you know, rails framework, right?
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.120]   There are certain rules and those rules
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.040]   will attract two primary personality types.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.640]   One is like a used car salesman.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.920]   Now, there's lots of good people who sell used cars,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.080]   but it will attract that quick hit I want to figure out
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.800]   how to make money and how to reach an audience very, very
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.520]   quickly.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.920]   The other type is the engineer, the geek, the nerd,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.320]   the person who likes putting puzzles together.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.880]   Unfortunately, one personality type
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.240]   is far more in greater abundance than the other.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.760]   If you go to Elliottsearchengine.com, by the way,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.000]   you'll get a Facebook game.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.120]   Talk about SEO.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.160]   It's all about Dexter.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.040]   But I think that that's cross-marketing anyway.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   I just thought I'd throw that in so that we--
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.800]   I love that.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.400]   It's the TV Easter egg.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.840]   Yes.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.800]   You can see more and more of that, I'm sure.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.760]   The creator of Heroes, who's doing something for getting--
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.200]   Tim Craig.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.920]   Delighted.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.360]   Thank you.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.720]   Tim Craig delighted in doing that.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.280]   And put in-- he would put in a business card
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.200]   with a small email address.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.520]   And no people would have to stop the video
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.160]   and blow it up and figure it out.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.280]   And then he had something there for them when they went there.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.720]   It's really smart, I think.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.320]   Yeah, it is.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.040]   I think that's brilliant.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.560]   It's a smart way to give a nod to your really loyal,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.120]   interested viewers.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.000]   You're super engaged viewers.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.840]   Which more and more of us are, because we're all getting nerdy.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.560]   Right?
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.080]   Right.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.600]   And we all have DVRs where we can pause it and blow it up
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   and get to it.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.960]   And of course, in the long run, these engaged viewers
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.800]   are the most valuable viewers.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.160]   Those are the ones you really want.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.320]   So you're going to play to them more and more, I think.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.280]   Well, that's what Leo-- you're the one who's smart enough
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.640]   to see that, cring is smart to see that.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   But media as a whole is not.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.240]   That's where SEO comes in.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.640]   Right.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.440]   Numbers, big numbers, masks.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:28.920]   Right.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   Well, sell it to dumb out.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.600]   It's media's fault and advertisers.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.200]   Right.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.440]   You're right.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.720]   It's all about the mask numbers.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.480]   But that's going to-- I could say that's going to change.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.880]   Google Doodle this week is Thanksgiving.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.520]   They launched it early.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.680]   And this is just the G-plusification of everything.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.440]   Look at that.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.760]   G-plus share right on it.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.240]   First shareable logo ever.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.360]   That's-- I mean, when they said we're going to put G-plus
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.120]   everywhere on Google, they meant it.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.720]   They weren't kidding.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.200]   It's on the Google Doodle for crying out loud.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   It's a fun Doodle.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.920]   It's a fun Doodle for the kids.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.560]   But there's a really cool Doodle going on in Europe right now.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.040]   And I wonder if Google timed this
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.240]   so that the Europeans didn't feel left out
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.600]   of the Thanksgiving Doodle.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.440]   You go to google.co.uk.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.120]   It's a really neat Doodle that's
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.600]   homage to a science fiction writer.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.800]   Oh, Stanislaw Lem.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.640]   Yeah, this is wild.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.400]   Lem is an amazing guy.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.000]   He wrote Solaris, which people might have seen the George
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.760]   Clooney movie of the same name.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.440]   There's actually been two movies of that.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.640]   And I know about it because Audible just commissioned--
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   there never was a good translation of Solaris.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.680]   It was translated from Polish to Russian to English.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.120]   So they commissioned the first direct translation of it.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.080]   And you can listen to Audible.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.240]   So what do I do if I click it?
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.320]   You click on the Play button on the lower right.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.920]   OK.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.240]   There's a video that has somebody playing it.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.320]   It looks-- OK.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.240]   So there goes the robot.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.960]   Is there audio on it?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.360]   No.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   Wow.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.440]   I feel sorry for our listeners who don't have video.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.240]   This is really cool.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.840]   So it's a pen and ink drawing.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.120]   And the bot is walking along.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.480]   Here's a giant robot.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.640]   Lem was a science fiction author, as you might have guessed,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.000]   from Poland.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   You have to answer the question, Leo.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.320]   Oh, 2 plus 2 equals 4, right?
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.480]   We know that, but it's going to be a tricky way to get there.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.080]   The next one.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.040]   OK, it goes--
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.120]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.880]   Yo, I thought better of you.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.200]   What?
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.040]   I got it.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.000]   No.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.080]   What?
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.800]   Next one's trickier, how to get there.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.160]   Oh, look at this.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.080]   I see.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.440]   I get it.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.920]   If I get it, it's the segment.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.800]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.480]   OK, got it.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.000]   Wow.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.840]   This is a very elaborate doodle.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.640]   It is extremely--
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.560]   Holy chamole.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.120]   Is this flash?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.160]   Yeah, it's got to be.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.120]   It's not-- oh, it's HTML5, of course it's HTML5.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.040]   HTML5, it's got to be.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:57.960]   Yeah, of course it is.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.920]   Yeah, but--
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   Wow.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.360]   It's impressive.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.640]   So when it slams like that, does that mean I got it wrong?
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.560]   No, you got it right.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.960]   It's like, you're the next one.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.240]   I only know this because I watched the video.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.720]   I cheated.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   This is-- this makes me love Google.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.560]   But it's not a search engine.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.920]   It's an entertainment unit.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.680]   Yeah, it is.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.480]   Wow.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.200]   I know Google Search used to be a place where you wouldn't
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.640]   stay very long.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.000]   Right.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   I haven't even done a search.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.120]   And I'm stuck here.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.920]   We'll be back in a half hour audience.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.440]   Yeah, really.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.120]   Forget the show.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.720]   Can I do this for a while?
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.880]   Those of you on audio, Leo was trying
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.920]   to go through a logical headache right now,
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.760]   remembering his days of geometry and logic.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.840]   It's fun.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.640]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.400]   I'm just doing cut-on-air.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.280]   It's really fun.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   Well, that's cool.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.720]   The chat room, I'm sure, in a second
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.800]   would tell you what to do.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   This is great radio, says 40 thieves.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.960]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.760]   And all we got is a turkey.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.440]   Yeah, and all we got was an interactive turkey
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.760]   that you could share on Google Ads.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.720]   Just tells you what Google thinks of US
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.120]   as Americans versus Europeans.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.680]   Oh, that's too hard for you.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.360]   You might want to click the turkey's feathers.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.640]   And they change color.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.000]   It's pretty.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Yeah, share that on Google Play.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.120]   Is this all it does, really?
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.040]   Oh, I got a football helmet.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.320]   Yeah, you can customize.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.720]   You can change the feather colors and the headdress.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.920]   Whoa, it's got a randomizer, too.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.760]   Look at that.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   Pull the lever.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.840]   So, Gina, the question you asked before,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.640]   but what else they should kill?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.680]   We've heard it around now.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.200]   What else could you imagine gets the Google+ treatment?
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.760]   What else gets the Google+ treatment?
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   I think everything can get the Google+.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.960]   I mean, you can put a plus everywhere.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.520]   Everywhere.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.760]   Well, they've already put the plus bar everywhere, right?
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.880]   That black bar is on top of everything now.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.160]   Right, but the plus sign and being
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.360]   able to share places and maps, the doodle results.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.400]   I mean, I get most excited about the things
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.080]   where you can make something unique and then share it
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.120]   in the spirit of Mixle, which is that iPad app I was showing
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:07.640]   earlier.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.480]   And that's kind of what the turkey doodle does, right?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.040]   You customize the picture and then you share it.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.920]   And so I like to see more of that because I'm just interested in--
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.800]   Oh, see, I'm an idiot.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.360]   I shared it without customizing it.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.800]   Look at my pretty turkey.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.240]   He's so good.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.400]   So Google+ has also added trends, right?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.280]   Trending topics.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.320]   Where are those?
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.800]   Are those on the left or the right?
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.040]   I couldn't find them.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.680]   It's after you do a search, I think.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.520]   Oh.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   I couldn't find them either.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.720]   I didn't see the story.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.800]   And I didn't see--
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   You try this.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.040]   Let me read the story.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.840]   This is from Search Engine Land, as usual.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.320]   Danny has it first.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.520]   He nails it.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.720]   Let's see what Danny wrote here about how
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.720]   to get trending topics.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.120]   I've always thought Google+ was a lot more Twitter
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.080]   than it was Facebook.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.680]   But once you do a hashtag search on the right-hand side--
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.640]   Got it.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.560]   Oh, or if I just searched versus the word Facebook.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.080]   OK.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.400]   And on the right-- just to be funny.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.840]   And on the right-hand side, it says trends.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.160]   Now, do they all have to do with Facebook?
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.480]   No, they don't.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   Unless we'll green-bait packers.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   I don't know.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:18.920]   Maybe they do.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.400]   I don't know.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:19.920]   Let's see.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.200]   Breaking down, dancing with the stars.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.600]   Yeah, these are basically Twitter trending hashtags,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   but they're not hashtags, right?
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.120]   They're just--
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.200]   How funny that you don't see until you do a search.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.560]   Well, Google's not being pure about the hashtag.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.520]   By any means.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.280]   Right.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.160]   Something's really slowed my system down.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.960]   I can't type anymore.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.440]   I just--
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.640]   I mean, hashtags are just search terms, right?
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.040]   And the hashtag itself is kind of geeky.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.600]   I mean, I've been embraced by our community, but--
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.160]   Yeah, I saw Christmas seen as post.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:54.120]   He's got other things, slashes and dashes and abbreviations.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.160]   I was like, oh, god.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.760]   No.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.720]   It's really already-- I can't read Twitter.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.080]   It's gibberish to me.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.960]   Maybe it's my age.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.840]   It's like there's too many--
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.320]   people are using hashtags as ironic commentary now.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.840]   It's like, stop that.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.000]   Stop that.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.560]   Don't do that.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.160]   Use word.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.960]   Use your words.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.760]   Pros, please.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.120]   All right.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.680]   Oh, there it is.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.080]   Trends.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.680]   Breaking down.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.880]   Yeah, I'm getting the same ones.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.800]   Breaking down.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.400]   Dancing with the stars, Green Bay Packers, Lady Gaga.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   So why would the trends only come up on search?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   Why wouldn't they be there all the time?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.120]   And of course, we didn't mention it,
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.040]   but they've got this new little tab bar on the right.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.120]   Right now, it's just YouTube.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   But eventually, I imagine other Google features
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.320]   will be over here on the right, too.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.720]   That weird tab that as you scroll down comes back.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.160]   It's so weird.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.080]   Yeah, it is a little--
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.680]   you have not-- is a little weird.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.600]   I don't like it.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.400]   I mean, I'm really interested in those collaborative experiences
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.120]   like watching a YouTube video with friends.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.600]   That's neat.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.360]   I'd like to see more of that, right?
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.160]   Like I want to-- you know, screen sharing, pair programming.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.640]   Hey, take a tour of my favorite city on Google Earth,
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.760]   or Google Maps with me, or be able to replay it.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.640]   That kind of thing.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.280]   But I have a feeling this one of the reasons
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.600]   my browser is getting so slow is because Google is filled
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.560]   with these-- you know, look at this now.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.680]   When I move my mouse over YouTube,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.000]   it slides open and says, what would you like to play?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.840]   That is not functionality that belongs on Google+.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   No, you're right.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.360]   That's--
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.480]   That's nutty.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.040]   And it's slowing everything down.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.920]   Oh, well, I'm sorry.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.280]   I'm getting old.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.600]   The BBC just had a story.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.680]   I didn't put it up on the list because I thought it was such
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.920]   BS, but they just were asking the question--
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.040]   it was one of those journalist tricks.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.000]   Ask the question you know what the answer they have is.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Right.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.680]   You know, is Google--
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.840]   Google's another-- the other second thing
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.040]   is you have somebody to deny something that doesn't exist.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.920]   So Google denies that Google+ is dead.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.440]   Google denies it ever stopped beating its wife.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.800]   No, it never started.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.960]   Google+ is now on Google News 2.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.720]   They're going to be social tools in the Google News.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.000]   We already have the plus 1 button.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.520]   But now when you sign in to Google+,
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.760]   you'll see articles your friends have been-- this is just--
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.320]   it's over.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.640]   It's overloaded.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.840]   It's ridiculous.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.960]   And it's just going to get worse.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.280]   If you search, by the way, for plus now,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.440]   how do you get the New York Times brand page?
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.920]   Did you just search for New York Times, right?
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.840]   You just just lost New York Times.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.640]   But I'm not getting it.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.600]   I guess you searched Google for plus New York Times, not
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.520]   Google+, so that's weird.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   What?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.280]   Works for me, N+.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.720]   Yeah, plus New York Times.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.840]   Yeah, it even knows to add the--
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.280]   like, I just type plus new, and it new to show me what--
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.120]   It's not showing me it's doing a search.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:45.840]   It's doing a search.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.280]   It's not doing that.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.160]   Are you putting spaces?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.320]   Yeah, I am.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.560]   I did a Google search, not a Google+ search.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.160]   Yeah, but I did a plus.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.760]   That did work for me in Google+.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.120]   I had to go to another page, and outside of Google+
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.080]   and search.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   Are you following them?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.680]   Are they in your circles?
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   Oh, you have to follow them.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.160]   Well, yeah, you shouldn't have to,
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.280]   because how would you find somebody new to follow?
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.600]   This is an awfully long time.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.320]   There are slosages.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.120]   All the news that's fit to plus.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.560]   This is not working.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.720]   It's not working for me.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.240]   New York Times, it's a search.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.080]   They'll go to a plain Google search, go up to your bar.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.760]   But that doesn't work there.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.840]   See, I know.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.520]   That's wrong.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.000]   I know.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.240]   It's doing a search.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.320]   Do you mean New York Times?
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.160]   No, I mean, oh, all right, Google.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   Let's try it from here.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.560]   This is--
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.040]   I don't know.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.160]   That's New York Times, to the plus New York.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160]   Plus?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.640]   New York.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.080]   Yeah, now exactly right.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.720]   It won't work in Google Plus, but it'll
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.280]   work in the Google search.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.000]   The point of all this, which was not worth the travel,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.600]   was notice the slogan.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.240]   All the news is fit to plus.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.920]   Boy, Arthur Oakes-Seltzberger is spinning in his limousine,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.000]   stretch limousine.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.040]   That's interesting.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.440]   He said we won't be a print newspaper in 10 years,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.240]   and he said that about five years ago.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.360]   So if you're in the cloud--
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.960]   We have in the rundown that there's now Barack Obama plus
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.640]   page, which is his campaign.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.760]   So it's fundraising.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.600]   I can't figure out how to get to it either.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.720]   You can't just--
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.160]   Plus Barack?
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.520]   No.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.640]   Plus Barack.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.200]   Plus Barack.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.800]   No, it doesn't work for me.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.040]   I think it just works for you, Gina.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.200]   It's working for me in New Jersey.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.760]   I have both of those in my circles.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.560]   I have both in New York Times.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.960]   Well, once you've circled them, it should work.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.160]   But you should be able to do a plus search.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.680]   Right.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.400]   I just did it both.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.800]   Unsarcled and circled worked just fine.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.120]   Ah.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.160]   Ah.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.000]   Click the first name.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.440]   Click this.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.040]   See, this is going to give me a search for Barack Obama.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.200]   Which gives me Dan Patterson's article.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.880]   Outstanding.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.320]   Yes, it has good taste anyway.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.520]   Clearly.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.600]   What I think is most interesting about this--
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.000]   I remember 2007 and 2008.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.680]   I was covering the presidential campaign at the same time.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.480]   Twitter was out.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.520]   I was using Twitter.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.800]   But mainstream America, if you remember,
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.520]   it wasn't until around the time of President Obama's
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.760]   inauguration in 2009 that Twitter really
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.120]   tipped that the social web tipped.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.360]   And that wasn't that long ago that OFA or that President
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.480]   Obama's campaign has set up a Google+ page.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.240]   We kind of take for granted right now.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.280]   It's not a news story.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.200]   Right.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.640]   It's not a news story.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.120]   But we have changed so much in such a short period of time.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.800]   When history looks back at this period of time,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.760]   we will be remembered as--
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.120]   this recalls what you just said about the New York Times--
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.760]   that we've experienced so much change,
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.560]   the dynamics of our conversations
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.280]   have changed so much in three years that this is--
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.040]   it's unprecedented.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   I was thinking the other day.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   If you can say that things are changing in a linear fashion
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.120]   or, as Ray Kurzweil says, an exponential fashion.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.040]   Exponential.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.960]   It seems to be.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.160]   But I don't want to make it a given, just because Ray says it.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:20.680]   But--
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.960]   This is where I argued last week that the change is actually
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.320]   slower than we think.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.360]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.520]   It's interesting, Jeff.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.680]   That's what I've been wondering, too.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.760]   Through, of course, human history,
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   it's been a lot slower than it is right now.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.000]   There's no question that it's going fast.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.200]   But is it really exponential?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.440]   I believe that it is exponential, although culturally,
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.800]   the change will happen at different tempos
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.680]   and different speeds.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:45.880]   That's true.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.400]   I can see this with the organization that I just left.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.560]   I mean, trying to get a Dan Tumblr share button
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.280]   on one of their websites was three weeks of negotiations
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.080]   and meetings, right?
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.560]   And by the way--
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.280]   I'm not a exaggerate.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.400]   I mean--
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.000]   Well, all right.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.320]   It may be that the distance between us, right,
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.240]   that our culture, the web culture, the tech culture,
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.760]   is experiencing accelerated change.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.520]   And the world is experiencing this change,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.160]   but it's reflected in us as though it is very fast.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.000]   And it's reflected in other cultures,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.760]   like traditional news at a much slower pace.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.760]   So the distance that it might--
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.680]   Well, OK.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.040]   All right.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.760]   That's fair.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.080]   But I also think that that assumes that we kind of know
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.640]   what the change is.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.480]   And what we--
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.080]   I don't think--
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.400]   --what we are saying is that if you instead
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.320]   say that the change is much vaster than we've yet seen,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.720]   then in 100 years you'd look back and say, well, actually,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   no, the change was slow.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.080]   It was Gutenberg years.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.160]   We think it's huge.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.640]   And it is huge to us.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.600]   You're right.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.000]   But to an ant, a giraffe looks big,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.240]   but what if it's a skylobate or what kind of--
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.360]   I think this notion that it's exponential
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.800]   is predicated on Moore's law primarily.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.920]   The fact--
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.280]   Gordon Moore of Intel said that the chip processor transistor
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.360]   count would double every 18 months, which is exponential.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.480]   And it seems that maybe not everything changes
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.560]   at the same pace.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.040]   I don't know.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:12.400]   I don't--
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.600]   Sure.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.200]   And I think you make a good point, Dan,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.080]   that culturally things change at very differing paces.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.000]   You know, on Twitch--
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.080]   We got a lot of blowback on Twitch this week
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.240]   because we were talking about Google Music.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:35.160]   And the panelists, Cara Swisher, Mike Elgin,
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.840]   Ralph Needleman from CNET and Kevin Rose--
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.120]   these are all cutting edge people.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.760]   They all just agreed, oh, well, it's too late, too little,
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.200]   too late.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.920]   Nobody-- everybody's just going to use subscription services.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.520]   Nobody wants to own music anymore.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.920]   And I got a surprising amount of pushback from the audience
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.240]   saying, what are they crazy?
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.040]   They just accepted as given?
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.000]   I accepted as given.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.240]   I think that is the case.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.080]   But I think there is an example of a cultural mismatch,
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.880]   but that there are people who are moving a lot faster.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.200]   And they've already seen it.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.240]   They've already said, nah, no, Spotify.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   Who's buying music anymore?
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.760]   We don't need music anymore.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.000]   I mean, obviously, there'll be a small number of people
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.120]   who will continue to buy music.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.080]   But I think it's pretty clear that subscription services
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.320]   mean that Google Music is too little too late.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.160]   Yes.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.600]   I also think that there are some pretty
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.200]   qualifiable cultural benchmarks that we can look at.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.560]   We can look at a particular time frame
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.320]   and take some data sets and see how people communicated, how
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.240]   they acted, and how they consumed not just information,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.680]   but products.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.280]   And we can look at the last five years and measure
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.800]   against those benchmarks, say, take 1950 to 2000.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.320]   Very, very little change.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.600]   Now, of course, Jeff, what you're saying is true.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.480]   The further out, the closer we get to a 30,000-foot view,
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.880]   things are going to look a lot smaller.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.720]   In terms of the context of contemporary history, right,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.240]   say since the Industrial Revolution,
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.640]   I would argue that we have made more change
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.120]   in the last five years than we did
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.640]   since the Industrial Revolution.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.600]   I'm not judging you on that scale, Dan.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.520]   I'm judging you on the scale of how much change is still
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:14.080]   being caused by the causes we now see.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.680]   I don't understand that.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.200]   In other words, well, the example I used last week
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.640]   and part of me, I'm going to repeat for--
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.520]   sorry, chat room.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.800]   We're going to get your glasses ready.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.040]   How about us, moment?
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.120]   It's Gutenberg, Gutenberg moment.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.920]   That if you ask people in Germany in 1472,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.320]   whether they thought Gutenberg would
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.560]   tear apart the Catholic Church, change our notion of nations,
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.080]   change our--
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.920]   it sparked the scientific revolution,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   change our notion of education and thus of childhood.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.360]   They all say, nah, you nuts.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.440]   We've been changing like crazy.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.400]   Look, the whole political structures changed.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.240]   My god, we're almost done with the change.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.520]   The change was much more.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.960]   But anyone then could see, and I think we're in the same case.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.320]   Now, there's a wonderful book out, e-book out, called
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.640]   "Race Against the Machine" by Eric.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.000]   I'll mispronounce this Bryn Yolfsson and Andrew McAfee.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.840]   And I just read it.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.600]   And the example that they give is the old chessboard
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.800]   and grains of rice that people apply.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.760]   And what they said was, when you get to the second half
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.640]   of the chessboard is when it gets just so free to be--
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   The hockey stick.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.160]   That's what Chris Wild calls the hockey stick.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:18.800]   Right.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.760]   It's the inflection point.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.760]   So they argue that we're there now.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.320]   So I'm not--
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.800]   That's what Chris Wild argues as well.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.560]   We're undergoing a lot of change,
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.920]   and that change seems very quick.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.000]   But I think that we're judging the pace and extent
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.160]   of that change on the analog of what we
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.880]   knew in the last world, in the industrial world.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   And I think that I will live to look back and say,
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.520]   yeah, that was the beginning.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.720]   That guy Jarvis got to live through the very beginning of it.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.040]   Man, he had no idea what was going to happen.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.800]   And he sure, absolutely agree with that.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.640]   And that matters because I got criticized again recently.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.160]   I don't know why people criticize me.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.760]   I'm a nice guy.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.320]   And it's only me, Jarvis Murphy, who
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.440]   went after Shurkey and Jay Rosen and me for these future
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.080]   of news guru people and trying to protect the past.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.240]   And my response to that was going to--
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.040]   well, the response I haven't written,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.200]   but the response is, do you remember
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.840]   that great scene in broadcast news when Holly Hunter's with her boss
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.880]   and her boss says, it must feel good to always be right.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.040]   And she said, no, it's awful.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.440]   An old mentor in Boston, mine asked me about a year ago,
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.600]   well, it must feel good, Jarvis.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:27.960]   You were right.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.360]   And I said, no, I wasn't right.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.240]   I was wrong.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.080]   I never wanted to guess Twitter.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.920]   I never wanted to guess the extent of the change.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.880]   I was obnoxious arguing that we were going to change like crazy.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.440]   And I didn't go far enough.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.200]   I wasn't loud enough.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.680]   And that's where I think we are now.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.400]   So the danger of saying, oh my god,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.160]   we've really seen a lot, a lot of change
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.760]   is that I think we may think that we're at some arc right now.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.200]   And I don't believe we are.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:51.680]   Oh, sure.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.840]   But I don't think making that argument is a binary.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.320]   I mean, I think that you can absolutely say,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.160]   we have experienced a ton of change in the last five years.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.040]   And I don't think that excludes the change that we will see.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.280]   It's not a binary.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.680]   It's not an either or.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.560]   It is, yes, we've seen a tremendous amount of change,
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.520]   but you're absolutely right in that predicting
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.040]   the types of changes that we will see.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.080]   These will-- it's like comparing chess to go, right?
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.000]   Gina, you're younger than a couple of us here.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.040]   Yeah, it must be really impatient.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   I feel like the change isn't happening fast enough.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.400]   Bingo, that's what I wanted to know.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.680]   OK, perfect.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.880]   You're in a hurry.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.800]   I get in a hurry.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.320]   I get really frustrated when I see things like Google+
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.040]   which I feel like should have innovated a lot more.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.320]   When I see things like the Nimmores and conversations
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.240]   about whether or not bloggers are journalists happening over
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.440]   and over again, whether or not there should
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.320]   be more women in tech.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.800]   I get frustrated because I feel like I want things to move faster.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.480]   I want innovation to happen more often.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.800]   And now I'm very deeply embedded into the web culture
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.960]   and the tech culture.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.440]   And I do feel like we're on the verge
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.560]   of a lot of wonderful big hockey stick kind of change,
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.120]   culturally, like widely culturally.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.160]   But I get frustrated with our tech community
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.360]   for not moving as fast or innovating as much as I
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.680]   would like to see.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.880]   Good Lord, if it goes any faster, my wig's going to fly off.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.560]   Are you crazy?
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.640]   You know, I don't know.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   Well, I mean, Google music, this is interesting.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.160]   So Leo, you think that Google music feels like this catch up
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.280]   to something that happened a few years ago because--
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.320]   They're trying to do iTunes.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.280]   --to the future.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.320]   So does that frustrate you?
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.760]   It's like, well, why--
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.840]   No, it doesn't frustrate me because fortunately, we
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.040]   have MOG, ARDIO, SPOTIFY.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.760]   We have all these subscription choices.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.960]   So I don't feel frustrated.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.080]   But I wonder if this is the sensible strategy for Google
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.600]   or Apple.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.440]   You know where I do feel frustrated is that--
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.200]   And this is where change is too slow--
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.240]   is that entrenched powers that be like the record industry.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.000]   Don't get it.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.800]   Don't support it.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.640]   Pull out.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.400]   Try to kill it.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.960]   Time Warner's trying to kill your Skype Dan
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.880]   because they want to sell VoIP products.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.920]   All of these entrenched powers that are saying--
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.600]   they say the barbarians are at the gates
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.560]   and they're holding the door closed.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.040]   That's frustrating.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.400]   But in some ways, I think change happens so fast that that's--
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.680]   you know, I personally-- I think I love change.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.280]   I think that's why I got in this business.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.240]   But most people don't feel that way.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.920]   And even our audience--
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.680]   change the website and see what happens.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   That's true.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.120]   I think a lot of people wish things would not change.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.600]   Or we get used to stuff and we wish it wouldn't change.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.400]   I think we've accepted a canon that changes exponential
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.880]   and that we were in the hockey stick.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.280]   You know what the elbow of the hockey stick.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.240]   And I just wonder-- I mean, yeah, there's evidence for that.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   But I think you hit the nail on the head, Dan.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.600]   It's not uniform.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.080]   In fact, who was it said that the futures are--
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.360]   I think it was William Gibson said the futures are already
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:54.560]   here.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.520]   It's just not uniformly distributed.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.960]   All right.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.080]   That kind of says it all.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.880]   We're going to take a break, come back with more in a bit.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:08.840]   I'm going to show you-- I love Samsung because they have come
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.920]   back with such a slap to Apple that--
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.440]   and I'm very curious to see what the reaction is going
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.400]   to be from the Apple side.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.440]   I just think John Groobers--
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.880]   We're going to get trouble for showing that way.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.200]   I know, and I hope I do.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.920]   I think John Groobers head must be exploding right now.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.160]   It's the same to actually add him.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.560]   But before we do--
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.280]   directly.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.720]   Before we do that, let me just briefly say Netflix.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.640]   Here's an example of the future writ large.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.720]   Netflix started as a DVD by mail company.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.520]   And you could see they've struggled a little bit with this
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   as the content companies, mostly the movie industry,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.760]   have said, no, no, no.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.880]   You can only have three copies of that popular movie,
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.200]   or you can't have it for a month after we start selling it
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:50.640]   in the stores.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.880]   It's been very difficult with physical media.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.480]   But you know what?
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.360]   They're smart.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.520]   They saw greed Hastings.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.480]   He's a brilliant guy.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.280]   He saw the physical media is history.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.600]   I know, again, when I say stuff like this, people go,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   put what about we need our DVDs and CDs.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.880]   No, streaming is the future.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.960]   Let me tell you, Netflix streaming,
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.840]   they've doubled down on that.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   Not only is it only $7.99 a month for just a huge amount
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.080]   of content, but now did you see they're bringing back
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.240]   arrested development?
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.120]   They're going to produce it.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.600]   They're producing programming.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.560]   This is the future right here.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.840]   And if you haven't yet been watching Netflix streaming,
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.840]   you've got to check it out.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.040]   It's actually what's killing Dan Patterson's bandwidth right now,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.280]   because everybody's doing it.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.200]   I just read somewhere.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.600]   One third of all internet traffic is now Netflix.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.360]   One third of all internet traffic.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:39.840]   And why?
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.320]   Because it's great.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.040]   Now I know all you already have it.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.840]   So here's my Thanksgiving prayer.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.920]   My wish for those of you in the US--
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.520]   I know Canadians, it's too late for you.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.000]   And the rest of the world are going, thanks, Wolling.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.440]   But for those of you in the United States,
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.880]   please, when you sit across the table tomorrow from Grandpa
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.720]   and Grandma, Uncle Jim, Sister Betty,
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.560]   all the people who don't use Netflix yet, just do this for me.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.200]   Just say, hey, you know, there's this great thing.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.280]   You can do it on your computer.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.840]   You can do it most Blu-ray players.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.440]   You can do it on your computer, your iPad.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.760]   You can do it on your Xbox 360, your PlayStation,
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.680]   your Android phone, your Android tablet.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.840]   I mean, you can watch movies any time you want.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   And it's only $7.99 a month.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.200]   But Uncle Jim, @Betty, Netflix.com/Twitt--
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.080]   it's free for the first month.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.920]   Don't tell anybody.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.160]   But of course, they'll tell everybody.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.080]   Netflix.com/Twitt, help us spread the good cheer,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.200]   this Thanksgiving holiday.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.840]   Tell all your out of touch in laws.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.520]   Have you told Gina, have you done your mother-in-law
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.040]   about Netflix?
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.720]   Yes.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.080]   Good.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.400]   I will do that right after the show.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.200]   Netflix.com?
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.360]   Then she won't be hogging your TV.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.520]   Say, here's an iPad.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.960]   Go in your room, Netflix.com/Twitt.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.120]   And you're going to give her some Dr. Dre headsets.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.600]   It's a beets.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.480]   She needs the beets.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.760]   Thank you, Netflix for your support.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.920]   I was wondering if those Dr. Dre headsets were any good,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.840]   because I tried to figure-- because I thought, oh,
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.760]   these are probably terrible headphones.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.200]   Some reviews are pretty good.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.040]   Yeah, how are we throwing them?
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.880]   A monster.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.320]   The monster-- I don't like monsters a company,
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.440]   mostly because they sue people who use the word monster.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.120]   And they were selling those $1,000 HD of my cables or whatever.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.480]   But actually, apparently, they're pretty good headphones.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.080]   Who knew?
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.800]   I'm not doing that.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.720]   The Joe Frazier grill of the age.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.400]   Yes, the George Foreman.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.120]   George Foreman.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.040]   I did the same Joe Frazier, George Foreman, except it
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.240]   must be an age thing.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.840]   Because he's one of them just died.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.520]   That's right.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.640]   And so I was talking about the fact-- it was in Netflix,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.800]   that I was talking about the fact.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.720]   Great documentary on Netflix called When We Were Kings.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.800]   And it's Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.400]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.760]   It's Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.920]   It's the rumble in the jungle, not the thrill and the manila.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.640]   So that was my confusion.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.440]   But it was an early Ali fight.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.640]   It's an amazing movie if you've not seen it,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.320]   just a great documentary.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.480]   But it was against George Foreman, grill man, not Joe Frazier,
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.040]   the guy who just recently passed away.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.240]   Sorry, that was a detour.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.920]   You know, this whole show is a freaking detour.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   We don't know where we're going.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.280]   We have no idea.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.480]   It's all in my--
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   We're in our Ford, so we're enjoying it.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.280]   It's all my fault.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.000]   How many of you have seen the new Samsung ad?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:22.880]   It's worth seeing.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.800]   Let's play it.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.600]   Yeah, it's worth playing.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.880]   It's really good.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.480]   Just watch.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.880]   I shouldn't even say it's a Samsung ad.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.600]   I'm so amped I could stay here for three weeks.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.360]   Nine hours down, and we're almost in the dill--
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.640]   I think two people just left.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.880]   Why would they be leaving when we're only nine hours away?
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.800]   Yeah, I mean, this is an event.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.640]   Blogs are saying the battery looks sketchy.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.720]   You know, if it looks the same, how will people know I am?
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.520]   Great.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.040]   It doesn't say.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.040]   It doesn't say.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   Whoa.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.480]   What do you got there?
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.080]   Not sure.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.320]   What is that?
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   You guys.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.080]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:54.920]   Hey, bro.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   Can we see your phone?
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.720]   I'm sure.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   There's such a hamster.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.160]   Have you seen this thing?
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:55:59.680]   Ooh.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.520]   Check out the screen.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   This thing is huge.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.360]   Pretty massive.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.480]   And it's got 4G speed.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.560]   It's magnificent.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.400]   Samsung.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.080]   Samsung?
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.360]   That's a Samsung.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.760]   I could never get a Samsung.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.960]   I'm creative.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.560]   Did your Parisa.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.400]   Why do you guys just get 4G phones?
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.840]   I just get a 4G phone.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.640]   The Galaxy S2.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.440]   His phone is amazing.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   This is Samsung's 1984.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:29.720]   I think I think the dude you were a barista should be the was-up of the 8.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.880]   Dude you're a barista.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.280]   I could never get a Samsung.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   I'm creative.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   I disagree with that, Leo.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.720]   I don't think this is Samsung's 1984.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.760]   In fact, the 1984 commercial designed to convince you to come to Apple, right?
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   Right.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.000]   It's aimed at a market of people who are new and saying it's okay to come over here.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.200]   I think this ad is targeted at people who already own Samsung or Android devices.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.480]   To make them feel good.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.480]   Yes.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.800]   To reaffirm how they feel.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   That might be.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.960]   I love how they put all the Apple fanboys behind bars.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:09.680]   You know, they're in line waiting for their iPhone, but they're trapped behind these barriers
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.160]   as the real people go about their real life.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.240]   They're looking.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   They're looking.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   Yeah, I do.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   Yes, for me.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   Mmm, mm, mm, mm.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   [laughter]
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.280]   I'm a group of us saying that this is sort of similar to the I'm a Mac.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.280]   I'm a PC ad.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   That's what it is.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.280]   It's a switch ad.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   It is.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   But I think Dan's right.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.640]   It is to reaffirm your Android choice not to...
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.920]   It's certainly not going to switch any Apple iPhone fans.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.680]   If anything, it's going to make a my rate.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   Right.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   Well, that's a thing, right?
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   I mean, the ad is really mocking iPhone users.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.680]   Right.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.280]   Which, I don't love so much.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   I mean, I just want to...
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   Oh, I love it.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   [laughter]
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   Because I use it.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   I use Android.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.800]   I'm an, you know, it is ironic because I'm using an iPhone right now.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:00.200]   But don't you think that the vast majority of people do feel that way about this small
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.600]   percentage of Apple kind of hipster?
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.400]   Even Apple people feel that way.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.160]   If you can't have the sense of humor to laugh at yourself and okay, who owns an iPhone,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.040]   lives in a major city and has not waited in front of a store.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   It's exciting.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   It's an event.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   Done it.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   You feel like a jackass.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   I do it every year.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   I feel like an idiot.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   Right.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   Right.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.840]   I feel like these guys standing behind this barrier, looking at the world, look, they all
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.160]   have the white headphones and the lattes.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.360]   Oh my God.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.360]   It's, it's, it's a, you got to admit it's kind of pitch perfect though, right about.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.040]   It's pretty, it's pretty good.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.920]   But Dan's point is really, it is good.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.160]   I mean, it's, it's targeted toward people, first of all, who are bad enough in the tech
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.600]   community and know that this goes on.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.280]   I mean, you know, I mean, I guess most people know that this goes on, but it is about sort
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   of making us.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.840]   Well, I don't think this is a broadcast ad.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.840]   I don't know.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.880]   Do they, I don't think they brought, this is a YouTube ad.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:52.880]   They don't need to.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.880]   You just did.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   Right.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.040]   Well, but that's my point is nowadays you really can slice the audience.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:04.840]   And when you put stuff on YouTube, like the old Spice guy responding to Twitter, Twitter
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   and the other thing, you know, I think it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   good.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   And I think it's a very, very, very good thing.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.840]   And I think it's a very good thing.

[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:49.840]   [CHUCKLES]
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.840]   Chris Tibona.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840]   You've got to love Chris.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   Response to--
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   I love this guy.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   And all's hair.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840]   I love him.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   He's been on the show.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   He works at Google.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   McCaffey says that malware--
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.840]   Android is a malware magnet.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.840]   New report says 2011--
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840]   it was the busiest year in history for mobile and general malware.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   I agree with you.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   I mean, yeah, there was some mobile malware.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   It wasn't exactly an epidemic.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   The amount of malware infected--
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:25.840]   according to McCaffey, infecting Android devices during the third quarter grew 37% over the second quarter.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.840]   I've been waiting for a mobile malware apocalypse.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   I don't think that's happened yet.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   And remember McCaffey and the companies like this want to sell anti-malware solutions for mobile.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   They see that as a huge opportunity because they're losing their Windows market
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840]   as Microsoft puts out its own free antivirus.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   In the next version of Windows, there will be a built-in antivirus.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   So they've desperately got to find a new profit center and wear better than mobile.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.840]   Although we've seen malware and we've seen malware on the Android market,
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840]   Google kills it very quickly.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   Chris Tibona's response--
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.840]   he says the problem is that they say that it's inherently more insecure because it's open source.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840]   And of course, that's not the case.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.840]   And we know that.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:23.840]   And so his response is as usual, right on, a Serbic and very nice.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   I would agree with every point he makes.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   And he did it where?
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.840]   Google+, and Google+, 606+s, 756 shares.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840]   That's unusual.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.840]   You get more re-shares than pluses.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.840]   That's very interesting.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.840]   And 106 comments.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840]   A lot of engagement on that.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.840]   Good job, Chris.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.840]   He says every single consumer electronics device uses tons of libraries from open source.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.840]   There is no non-open source mobile device.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.840]   It says especially open SSL.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.840]   Most CE device apps are built with GCC, including the iPhone.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.840]   That's the open source C compiler.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:14.840]   And I have to say that I agree with him when he said no major cell phone so far, no major cell phone has a virus problem in the traditional sense that windows and some Mac machines have seen.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   There have been some little things, but they haven't gotten very far.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   And this is why users' sandboxing models and the nature of the underlying kernels, mobile is more secure by its very nature.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   He says virus companies are playing on your fears to try to sell you BS protection software for Android, RIM and iOS.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   They are charlatans and scammers.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.840]   If you work for a company selling virus protection for Android, RIM or iOS, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.840]   I like the, I like the Chris kind of just tells you exactly how he feels.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.840]   There's no missing words.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.840]   So, I, and I've been waiting for this virus apocalypse and I think he makes a strong case that maybe it's not going to happen at all.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   But certainly you don't need to worry right now.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.840]   Android or iOS?
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   I think, you know, the base thesis here is I think it's easy to think that open source is less secure because it's easy for hackers or evil hackers to see inside that your security model and exploit it.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.840]   But it's actually the opposite is true.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   More eyes makes it more secure.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   And that's been proven over and over again with software that we all use every single day on the web.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840]   So this is a great piece though.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   I'm glad that Chris posted it.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.840]   Let's get to our tip, our picks, our numbers.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   In fact, we're going to get Dan to do a guest tip in just a second, but first Gina Trappani, your tip of the week.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   The Google search app for the iPad just got updated.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   I know that a lot of our viewers don't have iPads.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   If you have an iPad though, this is basically, I feel like Google's way of getting a Chromebook onto iOS.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.840]   It's really incredible.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840]   Get the update, do a search.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   There's really neat sliding tabs back and forth.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.840]   Image search results you can page through like a gallery.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.840]   It's really, really beautiful.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840]   Android did not get this app.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   And I think that's just because Google search on Android, you know, in what isn't really Chrome, but I think will probably be Chrome eventually.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   And their browser kind of works this way already.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.840]   And you already have that if you're using the Google search widget on Android, you sort of have this already.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:22.840]   But if you're on iOS and mobile Safari drives you crazy, like it drives me crazy, you definitely want the Google search app and put in front center at home.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   It's really nice.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   Have you tried it, Leo?
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.840]   I have and I love it.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   It's really interesting.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   They've got voice search in it.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   I mean, they've had that before, but they have all of the apps, as you said, and it's a browser.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.840]   So you, I mean, it's the WebKit browser, so you never really have to leave it.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   I know actually a number of people who don't use Safari, they use Google search as they think it's a browser.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   A lot of people think it's a browser.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840]   So yeah, highly recommend it.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   Well, you'll get it anyway.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   I imagine everybody who has an iPad has the Google search app on it, and you'll get it as an update.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.840]   Get the update.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.840]   Mobile Safari drives me crazy.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   I still can't get used to having to tap into the search box.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.840]   You know, that there's a different search box.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.840]   You know, so Chrome has trained me now.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   It's just a nice bar.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840]   It's just a nice--
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   That's so old-fashioned.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.840]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:12.840]   It's so un-- it's true.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   The universal bar.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   You search or URLs.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   Why the distinction?
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840]   It doesn't--
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840]   Right.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840]   You know, why?
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.840]   What's-- get with a program.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   Do you want to do a tip, Mr. Dan Patterson, of DanPaderson.com?
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.440]   You know, it's less of a tip and more of just a gentle reminder, and actually covered a
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.640]   lot of this at the very beginning of this discussion about Google takeout.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.800]   I just want to, you know, a gentle reminder instead of a tip, the takeout exists.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.240]   And especially, I was thinking about this with the sun setting of a lot of these Google
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.080]   products, particularly with things like Google+, you know, I-- Leo, I know you've been on this
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.680]   and everyone within the Twit family and audience has been on this for a long time.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.880]   But any time I enter even a single character into something like Twitter or plus or Facebook,
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:06.160]   I go, "That's not on my servers and it's not on an open platform that I can control."
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.680]   And I discovered within the-- this is for WordPress.org users.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   So if you're running your own servers within the plug-ins add new menu, if you do a search
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:23.680]   for Google+ import, you'll find a number of different tools that will import many of
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:30.040]   your different platforms, but particularly the, you know, Google+ stream.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   It is buggy.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.840]   You do have to be kind of a developer and be able to, you know, modify some things and
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.640]   make sure that that HTML file is properly formatted.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.360]   But if you do, it will go into your site on your platform that you can control.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360]   That is cool.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.960]   And it formats it-- so this would only work for a blog post, Google+, right?
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:55.800]   And there are a number-- and I'm sure any WordPress.org user knows that there are tons
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.760]   of bad plug-ins out there.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.960]   There are-- I've found three plug-ins that are okay.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.240]   Nothing that is like a five-star review, but again, if you're comfortable with Google
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.520]   or with WordPress.org, you're probably very comfortable formatting things yourself.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.920]   Which ones do you like?
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.400]   What are the names of-- do you remember?
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.600]   Off the top of my head, I don't.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.480]   But I'll put this up on Plus when I find it.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.040]   I'll put a link and I'll drop a comment in the show notes or something.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.520]   I don't-- I mean, it's a good thing just to know about-- I don't imagine there's a mass
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.560]   exit that is at a Plus WordPress right now.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.800]   In fact, I doubt there ever will be, but it's a good thing to know.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.800]   I think it's a good--
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.800]   Right.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   And the tools aren't that robust, but they're good enough.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.120]   And that's all we really need before the community can start working on that.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.040]   You know, for that exact reason, I've always imported my tweets into my WordPress blog.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.000]   So I have a weekly WordPress post that's all my tweets.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.280]   That way, there's a record of it.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.600]   This was before ThinkUp and I just-- I still do it.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   And so that's a good idea.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.800]   I do cross-- right now, I cross post using Publish Sync.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.680]   So I publish everything in Google+, it cross posts to Facebook and Twitter, and then it's
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.080]   picked up from Twitter and brought over to my blog.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.320]   So I guess, in a way, in this indirect way, I have this happening already, that's probably
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.320]   what you want to do.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.360]   It's not like you're going to move off Google+, but you might want your blog to reflect something
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:21.000]   you own to reflect the content you're putting elsewhere as a repository of it, right?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Yep.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.320]   You know, I found this about a week ago.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.160]   And with that exact-- that Twitter tools plug in, you can click and it'll take you over
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.160]   to that tweet.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.960]   You know, Twitter search goes back four days.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.840]   And if you click the hashtag next to your tweet from, say, five years ago, I found stuff
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.760]   from 2006 and 2007.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760]   Exactly.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.080]   You search my blog, you're going to find everything I've posted on the blog, but also
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.360]   everything I've ever posted on Twitter.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.160]   I think that is important.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   Absolutely.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.160]   Good reminder.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   Thank you, Dan.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.480]   Gina, you had a second tip.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.160]   Do you want to do that too?
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   Sure.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.720]   I can mention it for sure.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.360]   There's now a way you can restrict search results in Google, Google search results just
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.720]   to applications.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:07.560]   And this is iOS, Android, and not just Android market, but Amazon and app-- I forget the
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.360]   name of that other market, but several different third-party markets.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.960]   So if you just do a Google search, it's on the left column.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.960]   Let's see.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.840]   I'll do to do text.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.440]   And you can drop down-- in the dropdown, you have to click on more.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.640]   And there is a link now to just applications.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   So you can see-- right.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.000]   So you can see results from the Android market from App Rain.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.560]   Mm, that's so cool.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.200]   AndroidZoom.com, there's a bunch of places listing apps now.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.760]   It's generous of them to do that.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.680]   So it's not just their app.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   It's not right.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   And it just works for iOS apps as well.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.640]   If you search for Mixle, which I was talking about earlier, which I really love, you'll
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   see the link to Apple's web interface.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.600]   That's really handy.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:54.040]   And while we're doing sort of backup and just general PSAs, before you go see your family
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:01.720]   for Thanksgiving, grab a thumb drive and save the Firefox or Chrome installer onto it before
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   you arrive at your parents.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   Good.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   Thank you.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   And they ask you to clean up their computer.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.000]   Next year, I'm going to do a campaign.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.520]   I was talking about Steve Gibson.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.480]   We all go home for the-- or if we go home for the holidays, that's the time to clean
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.200]   up, to upgrade, to install.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.760]   And I think that this is-- I want to start a campaign like Geeks Home for the Holidays
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.920]   Campaign, where we-- this is a perfect advice.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.840]   You know, bring a thumb drive with the tools that you need.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.440]   You upgrade them to Chrome, get them off of IE5, 5, things like that.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.880]   Yeah, I think that the Atlantic declared Friday, upgrade your parents browser day.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   Good for you.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   Good for you.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   It's great.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   It's great.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.560]   You get the installer on the thumb drive, because if your parents IE is hijacked, it's
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560]   just hard to get the installer.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.200]   So if you show up with the thumb drive, you're--
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200]   Brilliant idea.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   Brilliant idea.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   Sure.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.320]   I've almost flown Jake down to Florida.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   I've been on one.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.200]   Jake's-- Jake's-- Jake's-- Jake's son.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.960]   You're a number of the weeks here.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.800]   So I kind of like this when I was-- I was desperate for number.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.920]   I spent-- I swear an hour looking for a number.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   I was nowhere.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.480]   I go to Twitter, and I beg, and I say, "Ya, a number is for me," and a guy named Rich
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.000]   Goodwin-- Richard Goodwin, rather, or a good one at Twitter came in and gave me a wonderful
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:22.120]   one from a guy named Rich Jones, thus the confusion, about an OSHA app for Android and
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.320]   iPhone that he says is a sticking pile of--
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.320]   Mm.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   That's all about--
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   What a surprise.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.160]   Yeah, but it's all about the heat index.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   You know, that silly index.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.160]   You're like, "Is it hot?
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   How hot is it?
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.520]   It's really hot, man."
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.920]   And once we explained that to you, it had a little temperature converter to tell you
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.240]   how high you feel you are and all of the stuff.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.920]   And he said, "It's just got off of it."
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.240]   Here's what I love about it.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:52.520]   He used a fairly new site called mukrock.com, which is a site to enable people to file
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.320]   foyas, Freedom of Information Act, or else.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   Ah, right on.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:04.800]   And so he filed one with OSHA and found out that the application cost more than $200,000,
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800]   which is he saying--
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800]   Upbar money!
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.360]   For about $2,000 worth of non-functional temperature converters.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.720]   So all the documents are up there, and it's really kind of nice because it's a little
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.920]   slight moment of citizen journalism that does exist.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   Wow.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.200]   And the number of the week is $200,000 of your wasted tax money.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   I would have written it for $100,000.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200]   Gina and I would have done it for $50.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   We probably wouldn't have said, "Oh, it's the government.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.400]   Okay, I'll do it for free."
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   Did you see?
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400]   There you go.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   There you go.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   I would have gotten a grant from someone.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.280]   I thought your number might be 4.74.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   Ah, that's right.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.040]   I thought you were going to steal it so I didn't even go there.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040]   Oh, all right.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040]   That's the number of degrees.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.720]   It has to be six degrees of separation, you know, between...
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.320]   That was the theory anyway in the '60s that everybody was connected to everybody else
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.880]   in the world by no more than six degrees.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.680]   Well, they've done this study on Facebook.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.160]   Remember Yahoo did this too?
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.920]   I haven't heard the results of the Yahoo search, a result of the Yahoo study.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:08.840]   But there's a study from the Universitadei Studidimirano and Facebook, and they found
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:14.000]   that the average distance in 2008 between Facebook people was 5.28 hops.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.360]   It is now 4.74 hops.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.800]   So Facebook does bring us closer together.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.320]   With people we've never met and couldn't care about.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.280]   So there.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   I don't have an application.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.040]   I just want to thank Microsoft for hiring, first of all, hiring an advertising agency
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.200]   called the Wexley School for Girls.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.400]   That's a good name for an advertising agency.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.960]   They're trying to hire away employees from other big tech companies to work on Connect.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:50.640]   They set up a mobile bacon cart outside of Amazon and Google headquarters and offered
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.960]   free bacon with the label Wake Up and Smell the Future.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.320]   What geek can turn down free bacon I ask you?
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   Oh, man.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.400]   Well, a vegetarian one.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.760]   Oh, well, there.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760]   There's no meat and bacon.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760]   That's all fat.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760]   That's true.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.560]   I try to kill the developers of those companies.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.240]   Well, you're right because listen, it wasn't just plain bacon.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.280]   It was bacon with toppings like cheese, peanut butter, maple syrup and chocolate sauce.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.680]   That's the best inducement Microsoft is offering.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.640]   I'll take it.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.080]   I don't care what the job is.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.120]   They set it up outside Amazon yesterday.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.200]   They plan on doing it in Fremont on Monday.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.100]   Wow.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.760]   That is hysterical.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.600]   I just think that any ad agency named a wixley school for girls is going to be good.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.120]   They're going to be creative.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.120]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.520]   Thank you so much, Dan Patterson for suffering through your Skype troubles.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.080]   We're glad we could have you.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.760]   Dan Patterson dot com is his website.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:57.560]   No longer at ABC News radio much to their loss, but he's starting a podcast network much
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.160]   to my loss.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.160]   So stay tuned.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.440]   No, it's not going to it's different verticals.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.320]   Does it even matter?
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.480]   It's good.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.360]   It's good for the economy.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.160]   Rising tide sinks all boats.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.480]   No, that's wrong.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.120]   Anyway, thank you, Dan, for joining us.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.520]   We appreciate it.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   Thank you.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520]   I appreciate it.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.320]   Great to have your picture.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.000]   Thanks to Eileen.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.240]   Yeah, that's a nice shot with the beard.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.480]   He shaved the beard, by the way.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.720]   So that's that's an old shot.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.520]   You got to fix that.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520]   Thanks to Jeff Jarvis.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.160]   His book, Public Parts is a must read for anybody interested in the notion of living in
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   public.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.080]   Fantastic.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:43.520]   And each and every edition has a bacon bookmark.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   That's marketing.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   Wouldn't that be a good idea?
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.520]   Yeah, just the thought that you needed a print on a wax paper.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.520]   Gosh, that book smells good.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.720]   And have a great Thanksgiving to all of you.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.720]   Cheetah Trippenny.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.360]   I know you got apple pie in the oven.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   I know I got to get my pie out of the oven.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.080]   Yeah, everybody in the US enjoy the holiday.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080]   Yep.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   Yep.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   Thank you all for the show.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.040]   Oh, yes, I'm thankful for all of you.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:13.680]   Because you add hundreds of IQ points to this poor podcast network.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.680]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.680]   Thank you for being here.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.080]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.920]   20, 100 UTC.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.800]   I do a math in my head on twit.tv.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.160]   If you can't watch live, we've got audio and video to download.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   It's all there.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.840]   At twit.tv, please tune in next week.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.840]   We'll see you next time.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.840]   Have a great week.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.840]   And bye-bye.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:53.680]   Do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.880]   I wonder if they put any skin conditioner on you.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.480]   Oh, did they just groom him?
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.800]   He just got groomed.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.320]   Nice.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.400]   He's all clean.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.440]   OK, I'm going to call Gina.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.320]   Oh, Gina.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.480]   The dog makes me seem like more of a villain.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   No, Mr. Bond.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.160]   It is time for you to die.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:23.280]   I am in the Dr. Evil chair.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.280]   Evil.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   See?
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280]   There's--
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:35.760]   Doggy's are good because doggies don't know I'm evil.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.560]   But you have the petting down, the petting technique,
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.760]   and the eyebrow.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.680]   Awesome.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.280]   No, Mr. Bond.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.120]   It is time for you to die.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.360]   1 million.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.560]   Ernst Stavros Blofeld is the name.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.640]   I should just shave him.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.200]   So he'd be like Mr. Bigglesworth.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.000]   He has to be saved.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.440]   Mr. Bigglesworth.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.040]   Time to pull Jeff into the dark side.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.480]   Let's see.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.240]   Yes, let's see what we can do with Jeff.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.760]   How are you, Gina?
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.280]   Great.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.080]   How are you doing?
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.280]   I'm doing wonderful.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.200]   Thank you.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.720]   If we had smell-o-vision, you would
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.840]   be able to smell the amazing apple pie that
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.320]   is baking in my oven right now.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   Oh, now are you baking it?
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:16.680]   Oh, no.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.440]   My mother would not let us bake in.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.360]   Your mother-in-law, how exciting.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   Very exciting.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.560]   I expect you to die.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:22.920]   Sorry.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.800]   We've got to get that right.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.680]   No, Mr. Bond.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.480]   I expect you to die.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.840]   Can you hear us, Jeff?
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.520]   Yes, I can.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.360]   Can you hear me?
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.520]   Yes, we can.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.160]   Yay.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.520]   Does Aussie hang by your feet?
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:41.200]   Right now, he's looking for somewhere to pee.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.480]   Here, me too.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.200]   He's gone over to Jason Howell.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.680]   Now he's visiting IS.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:55.200]   He says, hmm, there's no food here.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.160]   Maybe there's some food over there.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.480]   He's basically a scrounge.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.600]   That's the negative about dogs.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.800]   All dogs are scrounges.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.160]   He's sitting behind me right now.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.480]   Cats aren't scrounges.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.560]   Cats demand.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.680]   They demand.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.760]   Our cat wakes up every morning, 6 AM.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.360]   Till we feed it.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.240]   But you have a cat as well, all with a thing.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.600]   Charlie.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.960]   Charlie's bigger than Aussie, much like twice as big.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.000]   They get along well.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.440]   And that's why Aussie's itchy, because he's
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.800]   been eating the cat's food.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.840]   Dogs have masters, cats have slaves.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.800]   Yes, very good.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.400]   Wow.
