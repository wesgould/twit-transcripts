[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey as the week off. We brought an
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.520]   amp-pruit. There is a lot to talk about. I will install the Android 11 beta as we
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.340]   proceed. Google has shipped 7.2 million pixel phones in 2019. Is that cause for
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.000]   celebration or dismay and an operating system for the end of the world? It's
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.440]   all coming up next on Twig. This week in Google comes to you from Twig's last

[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   for Twig. This week in Google, the show where we cover very little Google. I'm
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   just gonna try that. You know, I'm warning you. There won't be any Google. Now there
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.240]   will actually. There's a lot of Google this week. There's a lot of Google. Let's go.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.440]   Whatever we want because it's our show. We get to do that. Jeff Jarvis is here. He
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.960]   is the. Oh, no. Rate my Skype room 10 out of 10. Yeah. At the Craig Newmark
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.120]   Graduate School of Journal. All credit to my wife. Yeah. She was very happy and
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.600]   very proud. Really? She won. So this is her decor. Oh, are you kidding? That's not
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.200]   yours. So all those pictures over that over that way, right? I got he
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.840]   complained a little bit. He wanted a few large pieces. Yeah. But I'm quite fond
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.960]   of what she put together there. That includes two incunabriela pages from very
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.440]   early books, a few statues of Gutenberg, a big image of an ink factory. It's all
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.560]   very very very very very fancy. Very fancy. Yeah. He said, rate my Skype room is a
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.120]   Twitter account. And he said, yeah, that was the one flaw. He gave you 10 out of 10.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.640]   So that's a good job of law. But he gave you one. Let's see. Let me let me pull
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   it up here. He said books, depth chairs, French doors would prefer one to two big
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   pieces on left. He feels like that's not balanced, I guess. But I quibble 10 out
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.840]   of 10, Jeff Jarvis. Yes. Pretty good for the landing tab professor for journalistic
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.080]   innovation at the Craig No Mark graduate school of journalism at the City University
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   of New York. Pretty pretty. I'm retiring now because my life is complete. I've done
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   it all once I hit my Skype room, rate my Skype room. That's it. I need I need work
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.480]   no more. As we mentioned last week, Stacy has the week off. I'm so pleased to have
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.880]   Aunt Pruitt with us. Yay. Hands on photography, hands on wellness, his latest show. Good to
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.200]   see you. Sir, you do miss the report, Mr. Jarvis. Something's different. I can't put
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.000]   my finger on it. Did you just say if you're a man, he's gotten tenure at the
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.480]   university. Yeah, I did give myself a haircut the other day. Can you do me? I don't want
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.520]   to see you bald, Jeff. Actually, we saw you bald. You shaved your head like I did.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.120]   No, no, no, no, I just shaved my face. I was not stupid. I shaved your face. Shave my
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.600]   head like you did. Yeah. I goed you into it as I recall. Did you as a year fall? Good.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.240]   I can blame you. It was for charity. We raised money for UNICEF. It was a good tattoo, but
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   in my fault too. I don't know. But the hair grew bad. All for the good. It's all for the
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.560]   good. Still there. I guess I should put some Google in here. Just just to just to
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.720]   prove them wrong. So I, you know, it's funny because it depends. It's all perspective.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:36.640]   According to IDC, Google shipped 7.2 million Google Pixel phones in 2019, which sounds,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   you know, that's like less than one week of iPhone. I was going to say that's not very
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.520]   good. It sounds not so good. And yet it's, I think more than they've ever seen.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.720]   So before Google considers it a cause to celebrate. It's more than one plus cell sold credit to
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:06.240]   the 3A, which was, of course, the low priced version of the Pixel 3. And of course, we
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.800]   haven't seen the 4A yet this year. Google's probably not going to release that till next
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.040]   month, according to rumors. But that's the thing about those numbers are is it's the
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   3A. You know, that's the perfect price point for someone trying to get into a clean air quotes,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.000]   clean version of Android and good enough hardware at the time. It's not going to be
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   flagship style, but it's still going to be good enough for most people. So yeah, they
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.920]   should be able to sell those phones. But in the bigger scheme of things, it's still a
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   little bit disappointing. Just a little bit.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   Yeah, it is the best year Google's ever had with its own house made handsets, 52% up over
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.320]   2018, the year previous. So I guess it is cause for celebration, but it's
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.000]   didn't Google get rid of the pixel people? Yeah, I think I feel like they might have.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.160]   They were very unhappy with sales the year before. It was a terrible year. It does. It's
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.080]   dwarfed by Samsung and Apple, but maybe goo. I don't know what we never knew what Google's
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.200]   ambitions were in this. You know, what were they trying to beat Apple and Samsung? Surely
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.080]   not. Were they trying to create a phone that showed the best of Android possibly used to
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.120]   be the Nexus line was a low cost phone for developers. That's clearly not true with pixel.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.600]   Although I agree with you, and I think the less expensive phone is the best.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:41.960]   I love my 3A XL. 3A XL. Love it. Love it. It still bugs me that their flagship versions
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.720]   just don't ever quite live up because you just gave out three different points. And I would
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.160]   lean that point too, is what they were trying to do is more so of competing with the Apple's
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.120]   and Samsung's as far as flagship devices, because why on the heck would they price these
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.360]   things as $1,000 a pop? That's flagship size. And these things they just don't quite live
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.600]   up to it. You know, I appreciate good old Uncle Leo hooking me up with this here, Pixel
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.120]   4 XL. But this thing is not worth the money that Uncle Leo paid for. What do you like
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:27.920]   about it? That is not much of a difference from the Pixel 3 or even heck my son's Pixel
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.720]   2 that he's using. It's not much different from a user standpoint. The camera is here.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.600]   Your son would trade with you. Yeah, he would. He would. But the thing is, if we did trade,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.160]   I wouldn't see much of a difference performance wise other than if I wanted to go out and
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   shoot something with the camera. But just regular swiping through, it is not that much
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.520]   of a difference and is clearly not worth that money.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:05.160]   We will be able to put Android 11 on it apparently today. I'll leave that to Mr. Howe. Yeah, I
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:14.560]   can do it. This from the Android developers blog, the Android 11 beta available now. I
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.120]   don't know if that's the public beta or the developer hasn't the developer beta been out
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   for a while. Also, the developer preview has already been out. Yeah, so this must be the
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.920]   public beta. Let me see if I can. Should I do it? No. Should I do it? Come on. You can
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:39.360]   hand it. Yes, you should read the blog. This is your bike. I should read the blog. I should.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.440]   So all you have to do is you have to say what your eligible phone is. Go ahead. Let's see.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.960]   Oh boy, this is worse than last year. If you were install a beta version, you will not
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.800]   be able to unenroll and revert back to a lower public release of Android without wiping all
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.560]   locally saved data on your device. You may also encounter issues restoring a backup.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.880]   Sign me up to receive program updates. I'm a developer. No, I agree to the terms of the
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   beta program. Yes, I'm going to do it. Why not? Why not? I swear up. Up. Right, row.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.720]   Did I not check all do I saving you from yourself? I guess you're check all three. Do
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   I have to check them all really? No. That's crazy. No, it's surely not. Oh, maybe I did.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.040]   Oh, I see there you go. Yeah. Well, I'm not a developer. It's like you're a qualified
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.480]   investor. And they're going to. You surely are. That's sure. I'll bet. This is more
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:45.640]   CYA. CYA. Yeah. Yeah. So now if I go to update my device, it won't happen right away, but
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.960]   I'll check anyway, because you know me. Come on, come on, come on. Where's my update? Where's
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.560]   my update? Check you for impatient much. Yes. Very. Oh, it's going to do it. It's
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.760]   going to do it. It's going to do it. Oh, a beta version of Android R. What does the
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.280]   R going to stand for? Are we up to R? Wow, I didn't even realize that. High. And then
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:17.560]   Q was nothing, right? It was just Q. Right. So we're never are are. We're up to race pudding,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:36.160]   rice pudding. Think I'll pass. R rollos. R as PS chops in our chat room says are for regret.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:44.080]   I will give them credit with these beta releases. The last two at least seems to have been OK
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.240]   when you look at the message boards, because everybody goes in expecting it not to be perfect
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   because it's a beta install. But it wasn't a whole lot of complaints. And then you take
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.280]   it along to when it actually gets to production, a lot of that stuff is still there. And they've
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.040]   even added a few more things. And it's been OK. So but it's still it's not something that
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.400]   I want to do. Yeah, not anymore. I was in the past and regretted it. Yes. But I mean,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.520]   to be perfectly honest, it's not my main phone. I'm kind of more the iPhone guy. Yeah, used
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.800]   to be an iOS guy. Well, watch it. Watch it. Truth's going to come out. Truth is going
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.880]   to come out for a long time. I was an Android guy because I liked the flexibility. I liked
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.080]   the fact that I could change the launcher. I liked the widgets. And really, I don't think
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.160]   there's much of a difference between the apps. I just like the freedom that Android represented.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.360]   But unfortunately, with great freedom comes great hackage and fragmentation and lack of
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:57.120]   privacy, et cetera, et cetera. This is the Leo reverting to his norm. You just keep on
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.400]   giving up everything new. You give up Facebook, you give up Twitter, you give up Android.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:12.640]   Oh, contrary. And you're the hostesser now on. Got it. Okay. Take over. No, on
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:22.280]   contrarimal professor. I am merely trying to navigate through the Sheila and Corribdus
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:29.680]   of technology these days is a very difficult pathway. And you got, you know, you got the
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.960]   shoals of privacy to the right. You've got the shoals of hackers to the left. You're
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.560]   trying to somehow get your way down safely. And I feel like admittedly, I'm giving up
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.880]   a lot of control with the iPhone, but I feel like it's safer. It's safer.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.240]   That's fair. We're not going to say right or wrong, but I think that's fair though, because
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.040]   of how Apple closes things down and tend to be a little bit more but not something.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.080]   It is a I admit, it's a gated village. It's a gated, but you know, okay, you can be the
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:09.880]   host of the show yet you win. Got it. After after your nihilism last week, I have a
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.760]   book for you to read. Okay, go ahead. Humankind by by Rucker Bergman. Oh, yeah, I've been
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.160]   hearing about that. It's good. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, that's the one we already talked
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.480]   about the story from the Lord of the Flies real story. Yeah. And you were dubious that
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.920]   I think could be good about mankind as is your new nihilistic way. Yeah. And the book
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.000]   I think falls apart at the end, it gets really yeah, just like humankind. No. So you need to
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.400]   hear just a few hopeful stories. We have fallen apart at the end. We're doing it right now.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   This is when we fall apart. And are you basically a pastor? Mr. And I'm not realistic. He's realistic.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.840]   That's what happened to you. And oh, no, you were the nice guy. So I just
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.080]   know about it. Shut down as a fact that everybody. I just I was gonna make this my pick, but I
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.560]   think it's apropos today. I just read about a new operating system called collapse. Oh,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:15.800]   yes. This is this is this is winter is coming. He believes that by 2030, the global supply
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:23.920]   chain will collapse Y T K and you won't get Y2K for the 2030. You won't be able to get all
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.360]   of these complex processors and you and no one knows how to make them. So he's made an
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.880]   operating system to preserve the ability to program microcontrollers through civilizational
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:44.280]   collapse. You can do a TRS 80. Oh, not even that good. I mean, we're talking a Z 80 or
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.840]   worse. The idea you don't want it too fancy because you won't be able to get them. What
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   you want is processors. You can take out old stuff. Right. Because you're not going to
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.880]   be able to get them anymore. Bear bones collapse. Oh, yes. So that's that's that's that's that's
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.120]   that's my nihilism fits your mood. Yeah, that fits your mood. Yeah.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.720]   Winter is coming. It's all coming down around our shoulders and you don't see it. You're
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.640]   you're the dog sitting there saying this is fine while the house is burning up. Oh, Jesus.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.080]   No, I don't. I go back and forth. Oh, we're gonna we're gonna we're having a little trouble
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.720]   with that. No, he's bad. So the folks who hear that as the show goes on and Skype is being
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.760]   being nihilistic. Skype doesn't. Skype doesn't like me today, but it's okay.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.880]   Rucker, Braggman wrote utopia for realists. And now he's got a new book which I think
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.960]   just came out right. They call it. I just like finished listening to the sapiens of 2020.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:47.720]   I love to say it falls over the end where he gets a little bit to Malcolm Gladwell. This
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.120]   is that whole category. The Daniel Pink Malcolm Gladwell, you'll val noir Harari category
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:04.720]   of optimistic, you know, that bad. Are you sure?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.680]   It's a genius. Let me show when you all the words. So, so, okay. So Amazon, I'm at the
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.920]   Amazon listing, humankind, a hopeful history. And then it's books you may like the great
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:25.320]   influenza, the wages of destruction, the deficit myth, lifespan, why we age and why we don't
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.920]   have to. It's not good. This is look at it. It's the same people. All right. I'll read
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.480]   it. I will read it because God knows we need some good. So you just need a few hopeful
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.640]   stories. You need to you know, is that pose ant gave us a minute ago? Yeah. You can pick
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.920]   a little bit of that. You can pick and choose right. Professor, Professor, you know, there's
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:53.600]   plenty of examples. Yes. Either. Yes. I'm more interested in the trend than any, any
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.960]   particular anecdotal information. What do you think the trend here? Hey, here's some
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:07.360]   good news. The Pixel Buds. They might work again after I've returned to pair the new
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.800]   thing. How can you not be a nice things? How can you not be a nice,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.080]   honest, everything is crap. I feel bad for my son. So it was so excited about those and
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.680]   he ordered a pair. So what happened? It was the first day he was fussing about the sound
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.560]   in and out on the first day. Yeah. Yeah. Same here. I went through another pair. I upgraded
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:36.960]   the oh, the firmware, which is not easy to do, by the way. And yeah, there they were. I
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.320]   love the design. I love the sound. I loved all of that. But they didn't damn work. So
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.360]   they just on return. Number one. No, he still has them. Okay. There's one of those lesson
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.160]   learned. You might be. Yeah. There's hope. So this is the original post going back to
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.760]   May 1st. Pixel Bud audio issue cutting in and out while moving my head. This is what
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.400]   everybody's reporting static and unpairing. Right. And finally, here's a response from
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.120]   Google employee Chelsea W. I've got a quick follow up on some of the improvements we've
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.080]   identified and are expecting to roll out in the coming weeks, decrease instances of
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.720]   phone call. Don't decrease them. Get rid of them. Improve auto recovery when one or
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   both earbuds lose connection, improve media playback stability for phones that have software
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.680]   audio and codely encoding separately this week. This week. This was yesterday firmware
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.840]   two ninety six will be released that decreases the audio his static noise. Some of you might
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.440]   actually have that. Did your son have that? I didn't have that. He didn't mention anything
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.800]   about static. They're gonna fix it. I don't have the problem. You don't have because
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.960]   it's cutting out. It doesn't matter. Right. That's what he mentioned. It's just always
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.000]   cutting out. Now, now to Google's credit for me personally, I didn't necessarily start
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.560]   getting into wireless earbuds until late last year because historically, I never had a good
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.680]   relationship with wireless earbuds or wireless headphones because there was always some sort
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.200]   of interference or just connection issues with me, where I had to phone in my pocket or to
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.800]   phone in my hand. So I always just tried to stick with a wired connection. They were here.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.560]   But you know, but now I have two different things that I've been using here recently because they've
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   been consistent with keeping me connected and not having any of these issues. So when my
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.840]   son was telling me about the Pixel Buds cutting out, I went and looked online and saw that
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.680]   everybody was saying his exact same thing, which is pretty much what I've said about
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.200]   Bluetooth wireless earbuds for the get go. Yeah. You know, so maybe it's not so endless.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:50.800]   Just spec. Well, that's the problem inside or outside or both? He didn't say I'm gonna
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.000]   assume. Usually it's a weird, weird thing. Most of it, people report it's outside.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.320]   Now figure that out. I don't think it's Bluetooth. I think it's something else.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.840]   Yeah, because I wear Bluetooth headphones and admittedly, it's not as good as wired.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   They're going to drop out halfway through a call. They'll drop out and stuff. But basically,
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.960]   they're much more stable than anybody's reporting for the Pixel Buds. Those are normally bad.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.600]   I don't think it's Bluetooth. I think it's some kind of adjustment. I think it's,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.640]   it's the in-ear sensing and it cuts itself off. And then the two communicate in some way that I
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.200]   don't think it's Bluetooth. I don't know what that is. I just figure it's going through my head.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.000]   I got too much gray matter. Yeah. You're so smart. Both of you that they don't wear.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.320]   Yeah. Your son is very smart and it just, it can't get through the metal plane.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.360]   Oh, he's got you, fool.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:48.400]   Well, you were the one who's always calling them, what, rock heads, boulder heads. Hard heads.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.760]   Hard heads. Maybe they can't get through the cement.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.320]   Had enough Google yet? Well, don't worry. There's more.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:09.760]   Google sued for secretly amassing vast trove of user data. This is a complete file in federal
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:16.560]   court in San Jose. The lawsuit argues that while Google lets users turn off data collection during
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:23.200]   use by Chrome's web browser, other Google tools used by websites themselves scoop up the data anyway.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.720]   In effect, you could, and by the way, this by the world famous law firm of boys,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:37.760]   Schiller Flexner, LLP. The company, I didn't quite understand that explanation.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.800]   Well, because if you, if you go, let's say in in Cognito mode, or don't even use a Google browser
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   at all, there's plenty of sites, including by the way, to it use Google analytics.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.000]   If it has Google ad manager. So essentially, it doesn't even matter.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.920]   Google strategy along. And if you use an Android device, good luck, not given Google information
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:10.160]   about what you're up to. A consumer suit was thrown out of similar ilk was thrown out by a
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   judge in December, accusing Google of illegally tracking and storing geo location data within
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.120]   its mobile apps. Arizona's attorney general filed a similar complaint last night. Google says,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.000]   we're looking forward to setting the record straight. We'll follow Brown versus Google
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.600]   in the Northern District of San Jose.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.840]   With a case like this, what is the solution? Because just as you said,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.680]   Twitter LLC will use Google analytics for analytics because that's good data.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.840]   What is the solution?
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.560]   Yeah, we need it.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:55.600]   Is it a class action? I presume it is, but I don't see. So let me look at the pleading.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.400]   Usually the solution is they give a buck 50 to everybody and move on.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.920]   I don't know. Maybe they'd like to get Google to stop doing this. I don't see that happening.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.080]   There were some headlines about, you know, you could get your $5,000 from Google.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.760]   How many people ever get rich from these?
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.440]   We never got what's the consumer data company we're all supposed to get money from.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.960]   Equifax. Equifax. No, the exquifax. The exquifax.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.360]   Nobody ever got a company.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.880]   Open to get your $125 and then they realized everybody wanted money.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.840]   You've greedy bastards.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   It's a nobody's. You're ruined it for everybody.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:52.160]   So I am kind of stunned to have to report this,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.000]   but Google+ is shutting down.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.800]   Apparently, remember when they shut down Google+, they said, well, but it'll still run in G Suite?
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   Right. Now it's not even. They call it Google Currents.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.120]   I never knew that all the time. I have G Suite. I never knew.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   Never knew. Well, that's probably why they shut it down July 6th.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.000]   Jeff didn't bother to tell the world.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.560]   It does look. I mean, that looks like Google plus, doesn't it?
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   It was the one code.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.080]   Go jockey.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.880]   This one guy. You didn't want it.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.000]   That was always the knock on Google was that everybody wants to work on the hot new thing.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.640]   Nobody wants to maintain the existing code base.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:43.760]   Well, I remember when the Google+ floor, I was at Google and it was the big secret floor.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.960]   Nobody could get up there. It was a big deal.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.840]   And then after they released, I got to go up to the floor.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.040]   Whoa. Did you get to eat special cafe, Larry's Cafe?
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.760]   Months later, it was gone. Oh.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.200]   Whoops. But now I want to speak to you. Speaking of the categories, Cafe,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.440]   Google is coming back to work.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:12.560]   Box lunches. Oh, have shall we have a little violin symphony for the Google.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.160]   What is having to eat box lunches?
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.720]   Oh, man. I've been looking forward to my pod tie and my frothy
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.600]   tuna salad sandwich for you and chocolate chip cookie and chips.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.520]   At least they gave it to you still, right? You don't have to buy it.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.240]   Right. No gym.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.480]   And you know what?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.440]   Travesty.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.040]   No sleep pods.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.760]   And you and I are out of luck.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   We're a bad night of sleep.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.280]   This is a nap. It fix us right up.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.640]   Uh, six feet of distance.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.320]   So here's the question. Yeah.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.640]   How long before you ever see a buffet back?
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.480]   That's the problem.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.320]   They were they were they were playing like that because restaurants are going to keep going.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.640]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you get served.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.080]   And same thing on cruise ships.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.280]   Vegas, you get served now.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.480]   I mean, they might have a buffet, but you don't go to the buffet and ladle up.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.240]   Whole foods. The salad bar is gone.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.000]   Yeah, they if anything, they'll serve you, but ideally it all be packaged.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.680]   Well, we're in the height of the Corona.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   Although as as John C. de Vorex says, the fake coronavirus.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:33.120]   I guess all those 106,000 dead people are just faking it.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.800]   I'd take it back. You're not a analyst.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.520]   Not next to him.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.280]   He called it a chimera.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.800]   Big fancy word mean in fake.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.320]   Yeah, I don't know. I guess it till this is over.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.680]   I feel like it's over.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.280]   Don't you? It's like the sun is out.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.960]   It's warm. Look at the look at the numbers in Florida and Texas is far from over.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.320]   It is bad.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   I can go to the world and go to the university.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.720]   Arizona. The hospitals are jammed.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.360]   I think that's the thing.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   This is how are the medical professionals handling it?
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.480]   Aren't they being overrun in Arizona?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.680]   There it depends on where it is.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   New York, we went through hell and we'll be okay.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.440]   And I just see on the TV, New Jersey Governor just lifts stay at home workers.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.800]   Oh, sorry. I got to leave now.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.760]   Now that I can,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.440]   it can take me.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.480]   Cuffs off of me.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.400]   So, but Arizona,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.440]   a lot of stories, a lot of the epidemiologists like COVID Twitter list
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.320]   are going on about the numbers are very bad there.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.800]   See, I know in the Carolina,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.520]   they're starting to open things back up and it seems like people are going about a
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   normal life, if you will, just with a mask for the most part.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.840]   And I figured that would be pretty much what's going to happen elsewhere.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.560]   I actually just read a story that said, if we all wore masks,
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.000]   that's the solution, by the way, that probably not having a book.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.320]   It's not solution, I would say, it mitigates us.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.880]   Oh, this is a little bit.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.600]   This was just published in science daily.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.640]   No, that's not it.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.680]   I got the wrong link.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.400]   It was just published in ACS Nano, the American Chemical Society.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.720]   The widespread use of face masks keeps the Coronavirus reproduction number below one
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.000]   and prevents further waves when combined with lockdowns.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.080]   Even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission rates
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.040]   for and by enough people.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.960]   Unless it's a chimera, in which case, nothing can stop it.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.520]   I know.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.440]   Nothing can stop something it does and it is this.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:56.160]   Back to Google.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   No more stuff.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.040]   No more buffets and no more sleep pods.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.280]   Google drones being friendly bombs from the sky.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   Little bombs of education.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.720]   Okay.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.200]   Okay.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.760]   I think bringing books to show school children.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.320]   Drawings.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.400]   You're going to go off about how, oh, robots are scary and creepy and awful and
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.160]   awful things are going to happen.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.400]   No, they're bringing learning to children.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.840]   I hope they're not heavy books.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   Grown.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.880]   Mr.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.600]   Jealousy.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   I have a little off to be curious.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.440]   You're a little book.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.280]   That's the wrong connotation, sir.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.160]   Don't say bomb.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.320]   Okay.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.960]   Here you go.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.200]   This is a test.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.280]   This is Google's sister company Wing.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.800]   They're going to, this is a test to deliver library books.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.040]   It's going to take that their McDonald's Happy Meals.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.240]   They're going to get very disappointed with this.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.040]   He books inside.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.120]   Okay.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.000]   Here comes the Wing.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.320]   Oh, Lord.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.760]   Okay.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.160]   And there goes.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.680]   How big is this drone?
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   It must be a worst aircraft.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.680]   Is it a Matrice?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.840]   You're the king of droning.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.560]   It doesn't look like a Matrice.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.040]   It's probably.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.680]   I can't tell.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.280]   It's fairly hefty.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.240]   It ought to be really loud too, right?
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.520]   Let's turn on the sensor so we can all hear how loud it is.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.080]   Do you have my,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.760]   you have myself.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.480]   Look how many ways.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.600]   It's got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.800]   It's got 12 props.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:29.440]   So I wonder how efficient that is with battery as well as radio.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.560]   I hear you loud and clear, sir.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.040]   No, no, no.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.960]   I mean from the south of the drone.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.160]   The Santa thing drone.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.200]   Oh, well, that's all right.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.320]   We probably get taken down if we played the Santa the drone.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.040]   What is what?
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.120]   It has two more propellers in front.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.280]   It's got 14 propellers.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.040]   Is it autonomous or is there somebody?
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.400]   Must be curious.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.200]   It also has a flashing light on it as, you know, as a.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   Oh, look.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.080]   Here's your ball.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.840]   What if you're not standing out on the front porch?
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.120]   Does it just wait for you?
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.840]   You stay out there for a day just because you know the excitement here comes the drone.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.600]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.760]   Kid, you're supposed to look up to the sky and say thank you.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.640]   They left left off the part where they have to unhook it.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.520]   He just took it.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:15.920]   Oh, maybe.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.120]   Oh, no, it's.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.960]   I stand for the fifth generation.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.400]   What is it making sound now?
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.960]   I guess there was no sound on that Google thing.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.080]   Apparently,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.480]   wing, which I had never heard of.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.080]   It reached a high of 1000 deliveries a week this spring.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   I don't know if it's books or what?
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.600]   No, it's because it's my Taco Bell.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.360]   It delivers meals from Walgreens.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.120]   Do Taco Bell?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.480]   Oh, I call it.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.120]   Local restaurants.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.240]   If you're in a Southwest,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.000]   a small part of Southwest Virginia,
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   what carsten to do a coast to coast Taco Bell run for me?
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.960]   It's, it's, it's Christian'sburg, Virginia.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.200]   And you know where that is, Christian'sburg?
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.000]   No, I've never heard of it.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.680]   No, it's a small town in Southwest Virginia.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.880]   They also were delivering
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.080]   household goods and meals from Walgreens and local restaurants.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.240]   Packages up to three pounds.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.360]   Oh, no, this is.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.080]   Sorry, that's the.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.800]   Amazon.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.040]   No, wing delivered women wing.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   Receive federal approval last year to deliver by drone in Virginia,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.680]   beating Amazon's primary to the public testing milestone.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.920]   The company also delivers packages,
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.840]   which can weigh up to three pounds in Helsinki and two Australian cities.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.960]   Three pounds worth of books.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.680]   I remember when Amazon got the approval,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.520]   but I've yet to see anything that they've done with the technology.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   So Jeff, do you take this as a positive, wonderful sign that the world is?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.640]   Yes, I do.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.480]   If you live in Christianburg, Virginia, Helsinki,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.080]   it's not exactly like everywhere,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.440]   and it will never be everywhere,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.160]   because what you, the last thing you want is thousands of drones flying around up there.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.840]   There are certain places in this country these days
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.000]   where I wouldn't mind dropping a few book bombs.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.120]   Hope we did read the.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.920]   Oh, oh, Jeff.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   What books would you drop?
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.800]   Well, I don't want to drop in your,
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.640]   your human kind.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.440]   You've been kind.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.320]   Kind.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.280]   No, really, seriously,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   if you were going to try to educate the people of the world,
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.280]   but just let's not make it global,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.400]   just the people of the US.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   And you got three pounds to do it.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.120]   What would you deliver?
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.920]   I don't know.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.600]   That is, that's a question.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.080]   I don't know.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.480]   Of course, you can also just zap something.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.000]   Kindle books to them, but that's another.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.880]   That's a lot easier.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.560]   That's a lot easier.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.840]   Let's see something with Dr. Purnell, if it were me.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.360]   Nice sci-fi.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.240]   Lucifer's hammer, all about the end of the world.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:13.280]   So Lucifer's hammer, an asteroid, destroys much of the earth's population,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.600]   not the earth itself, the population survives.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.440]   But the problem they find is nobody knows how to fix anything.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.080]   Nope.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.720]   Nope.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.480]   We just got to start all over again,
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.920]   because we, and this is, you know, this is a little cause for concern.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.320]   We live in a world with amazing magical technology,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:41.520]   but would you know how to make an 8088 if something happened?
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.720]   Right.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.600]   I wouldn't.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.800]   Who makes these things?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.360]   Sir, I still wouldn't.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.880]   Go ahead.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.040]   I still complain about the fact that there are people out here right now that
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.840]   couldn't necessarily go and change the oil in the car or.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.200]   You're not supposed to.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.520]   You know, oh, man.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.640]   Did you ever hear my story?
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.760]   Did I tell the story on the show?
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.880]   You know, I mean, things like, or even change a tire.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.200]   Right.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.480]   Well, I had to stop.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.320]   I've had to stop on the side of the road,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.800]   because someone didn't know how to change their tire.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.720]   I just, really?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.840]   You don't know how to change a tire?
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.080]   Okay.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.800]   I can do that.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.280]   I can do that.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.120]   But you want to hear my oil changing story?
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.240]   What's that?
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   So I was working Chicago as a young man,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.360]   and I didn't ever garage or anything.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.040]   It was a part of the street and it was November.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.800]   It was getting cold in Chicago.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.040]   But this guy, this city, that convinced me that I was,
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.320]   I had to know how to change oil.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.800]   It was not hard.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.840]   Just change the oil, Jeff.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.400]   You get this and this.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.360]   This is to change the oil.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.040]   So I get under the car.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.840]   I loosen the whatever the thing you loosen is.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.360]   So all the oil falls out in the pan.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.240]   Right.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.200]   Okay.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:41.600]   Step one.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:41.920]   Okay.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.120]   Put that back on.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.320]   And then I take the filter off.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.640]   I take the filter off.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.040]   I try to take the filter off.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:49.920]   Oh boy.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.560]   And I mangled the filter completely.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.520]   Oh dear.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.240]   Oh boy.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.920]   And as a result, I couldn't put oil in.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.960]   I couldn't run the car.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   I had to have the car towed.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.320]   Last time I ever tried to answer.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.080]   You don't need to be changing all.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.320]   No, I don't need to be changing oil.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.560]   I have in the past, as a young man changed my own oil,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.160]   but it was a Volkswagen.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.600]   I have no idea what it would take to change you
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.120]   on a modern vehicle.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   Certainly they don't even tune them up anymore.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.200]   How high does your mechanical confidence go,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.080]   and would you?
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.200]   I could do a car.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.920]   I could do a car.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.560]   I can.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.120]   Well, can you could you change Mark Plugg's and?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.000]   I can do some time.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.200]   Oh, I did.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.440]   I used to tune up my VOCESY.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.720]   You know, I had a timing.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.320]   You have the all the vote, the moat meter,
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.120]   and the timing change.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.240]   And I changed the spark plugs,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.680]   tune it up, change you up.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.200]   But that was that was a simple vehicle in those days.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.520]   Right. It was so much easier back then.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.160]   But back when you could pop the hood on the car
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.040]   and you could look down and see that short ground down below.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.560]   Nowadays, you can't even see
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.440]   if the ground is up under your car when you pop the hood,
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.440]   because there's so much stuff going on in there.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.720]   Essentially, I just try to sell the car before I need to change the oil.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.200]   You sell your car every 3,000 miles.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.040]   That's not what I do.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.280]   Credit to CR1 in the channel, so that way.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.120]   Duck, duck, go.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:32.720]   CEO said was called to talk to authorities.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:39.600]   And Gabriel Weinberger said he's spoken with state regulators,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.120]   all 50 states, by the way,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.080]   all 50 states now in the US Justice Department.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.520]   Well, they all smell cash.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.000]   They want to go.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.720]   Justice Department officials and state attorneys general asked
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   Gabriel about requiring Google to give consumers alternatives to its search engine
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.640]   on Android devices and in the Chrome browser.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.560]   We've been, Weinberger said,
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.920]   we've been talking to all of them about search
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.960]   and all of them have asked us detailed search questions.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.640]   So that's where the inquiry is going at the moment.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.440]   Weinberger reported that the Justice Department in Texas
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.880]   are examining Google's dominance of the digital advertising market.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:28.480]   Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Department of Justice
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.600]   have begun drafting a lawsuit which could be filed in the coming months.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.320]   Could kick off one of the biggest antitrust cases in the US since Microsoft in 1998.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.760]   Actually, I was, when was the last antitrust case in the US?
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.640]   I think it was, well, no, I think AT&T.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.600]   I think AT&T was in the 80s.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, AT&T and CNN and stuff.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.960]   They went out for them recently for political ends.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:04.560]   Well, but, okay, because in the, I actually was looking at this earlier today,
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.040]   in the Wikipedia article on the history of United States antitrust law,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.400]   the 21st century paragraphs are really short.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.880]   And really pretty much stops with Microsoft.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.800]   Now, maybe that's a flaw, Wikipedia.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   But I don't think we've been really active in pursuing
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.680]   antitrust in the last couple of decades.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.600]   Just been threatened.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.320]   Just been threatened.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.600]   Yeah, there have been investigations.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.800]   So that's about it.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.880]   I wonder how much of this ties into
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:43.440]   concerns about bias in social media.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   I just wonder.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   How much it ties into politics and world, and CNN.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:58.480]   We continue to engage with ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Texas
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.560]   Attorney General, says Google, we don't have any updates or comments on speculation.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.360]   The FTC previously, you may remember, investigated Google,
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:13.840]   but dropped the probe in 2013, saying there's no, you know, there's nothing here.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.880]   Although you remember, though, was it the journal, the Wall Street Journal had
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:25.040]   communications that revealed that staffers had recommended an antitrust lawsuit, but the
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.160]   FTC commissioners declined to go for it.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.960]   Right.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.280]   Wow.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.040]   You know, the problem.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:42.000]   So the last example we have of this is Microsoft in 1998, took them more than 10 years to litigate
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.240]   that.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.440]   The upshot of it was nothing.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.320]   Never mind.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.600]   And in hindsight, it was it was dopey.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.320]   They just took too long to get anything done.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.600]   And it was dopey.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.960]   They were mad at Microsoft for including a browser in the operating system.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.800]   Shocking.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.560]   Yes, that's why you take over the world.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.120]   Shocking.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.400]   See, but, but, but, but
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.280]   2020 Leo in, in, in 2000.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.520]   Yeah, I got rid of my Microsoft.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.720]   They're taking over the world.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.000]   Yeah, they're evil.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.960]   Look what happened.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   Look what happened.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.920]   What happened is we got more frivolous about other things for, for litigation,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.280]   just stupid stuff.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:25.680]   Right.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.080]   Good.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.240]   Here's a good, here's a happy story.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.320]   Jeff, you mentioned, of course, that we wouldn't have seen the George Floyd video without Facebook
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.600]   and the 17 year old woman who posted that on Facebook.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:49.040]   It turns out that a lot of protests are using Google Docs because it's a good anonymous way
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:57.760]   to post information about upcoming protests, share lists of books on racism,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   a template for letters to family members and members of the
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.560]   college.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.000]   We used to be allies.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.200]   There's really good allies.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.720]   A list of funds, other resources,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.480]   shared Google Docs, anyone can view and anyone can
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:17.040]   anonymously have, according to the MIT technology review, become a valuable tool for grassroots organizing.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.880]   I think that's all.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.120]   There's another story in the run now that says, oh,
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.480]   police could come after that data, but they
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.960]   couldn't post any platform.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.920]   Right.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.720]   Yeah, be careful.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.040]   If you think you're anonymous on the internet, you probably aren't.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.080]   Well, it's actually not the police.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.000]   It's so there was there was the, what was it called?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   The nasty man list?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.960]   No, it wasn't nasty.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.560]   The media, the media.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.960]   The media, bad media man list.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.320]   She's called.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.000]   And so there there was a different issue was that it wasn't,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.080]   didn't end up being truly anonymous.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.360]   And there was the reliable liability.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.080]   Oh, is that true?
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.480]   So people who put there, something in there, weren't anonymously,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.400]   they thought they were anonymous, but they weren't.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.480]   Well, the S E men list, S, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.080]   The woman who started it got in, got harassed and, you know, there's other stuff there as well.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:21.040]   Well, we know she started it, but people adding to it, I thought were anonymous, but maybe not.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.280]   Anyway, so good thing to keep in mind.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.520]   Which one came first was that YouTube or Facebook?
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.320]   I can't remember.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.120]   YouTube.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.520]   YouTube.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.400]   In case.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.680]   So I would say just to argue with you, Mr. Jarvis, if Facebook didn't exist,
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.840]   YouTube would have still been available for people to take that footage and share it out.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.080]   Yeah, social media, social media, in either case.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.840]   Yeah, he's not saying face, it's just Facebook, but it was Facebook in this case,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.320]   but you're right.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.560]   It could have been Twitter, it could have been YouTube.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.600]   Could have been Instagram.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.560]   Oh, nope, nope.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.880]   We were on Facebook 2004, YouTube 2005.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.360]   Oh, but Facebook wasn't open to the public until later.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:57.680]   Right.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:57.920]   Right.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.000]   Right.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.480]   Right.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:58.640]   Right.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.520]   Right.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.800]   It was only for the campus.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:08.720]   Jeff Jarvis's message to Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.520]   I think it's likely that Mark is more likely to be able to read that anyway.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.120]   Actually, someone from Facebook came to me because of it.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.600]   Really?
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.480]   Well, tell us about it.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.720]   What did you put on a big deal?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:28.080]   Zuckerberg had a meeting with the staff and then he put up a thing on Facebook saying,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.200]   this is why I've chosen not to do anything about Trump's posts.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.040]   This is what we're going to do instead.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.160]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.920]   And I came back and just said, you know, I just don't agree.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.400]   And I think that you've, oh, this is true to that tree.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.400]   Yeah, they'll, yeah, I have to link here.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:46.880]   I have it.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.200]   I have it.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:47.920]   I can remember what I said.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:57.520]   So the problem I think is that Zuckerberg has been putting this in two realms that
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.560]   aren't the right ones.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.320]   One is we don't fact check the world.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.440]   I agree with that.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.200]   Two is we believe in freedom of expression.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.080]   I believe in that.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.640]   I agree with that.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.760]   But what I said was your employees are coming after you saying you have to take a stand.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.200]   And I've been saying that in a couple of posts.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.320]   And I said, you have the tool, all the tools you need,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   which Facebook, which Twitter has shown, right?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   You can add information.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.120]   You can add a warning, which says we don't approve of this.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.640]   But if you want to see it, here it is, you cannot promote it and you can kill it.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.760]   I'm not saying he should kill it.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.000]   I'm saying like Twitter, he should leave it out.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.680]   But I think he's got to make a stand.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.280]   You say he should model good behavior.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.520]   That's the main thing, right?
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.800]   So the good behavior, this is Facebook, which is about conversation.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   And if a friend of yours comes along and says something awful or racist or
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.720]   inciting or whatever, then you should call them on it.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.080]   Because otherwise, then that's where the new norm is.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.040]   So it's up to all of us to call people on bad stuff.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.560]   And it's also then up to Facebook.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.080]   I kind of like that because it's not saying Facebook has to be an arbiter of truth.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:04.400]   Right.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.520]   Or Facebook has to decide, you know, that's an untenable position.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.400]   No company should be put in that position.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.360]   No government should.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.440]   In fact, that's why the founders said let's not have it.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.400]   Let's have the First Amendment.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.760]   Let's not put the government in that position.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.000]   But I agree with you, they have some responsibility.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.400]   As you point out, they have, you know, the algorithm does in effect,
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.240]   give them some editorial control of what you see and what you don't see.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.000]   So they have some responsibility.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.680]   This is a kind of a nice middle ground.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.920]   Model good behavior.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   And it doesn't have to be good behavior.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.440]   We can all agree on.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   It doesn't have to be, this is wrong.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.960]   This post is untruthful.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.640]   It's merely what you would say to a neighbor if they said something appalling.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.000]   You would say, "It's a Mark's garden party."
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.560]   Hold on.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.000]   That's not right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.880]   Right.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   That's the best of the line.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.800]   But can he do it without the weight of,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.160]   you know, it has to look like a friend, a neighbor said it as opposed to...
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.720]   Well, so this is the conversation I have with somebody who just,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.400]   I have somebody I met once, but I hadn't talked to in a couple of years.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.240]   Just came in and said, "I want to understand what you're saying."
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.480]   So it was a really neat discussion we had over the weekend.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.960]   And nothing, I'm sure will come of it, but it was a nice conversation.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.440]   And so what this person was asking me was,
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.760]   "Is it Mark speaking or is it Facebook speaking?"
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.960]   He said, "Mark gave a speech at Georgetown and said kind of all this."
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.360]   Right.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   And I said, "No, it's got to be Facebook.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.240]   It's got to appear.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.680]   It's not Mark's speech.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.920]   It's got to appear with that item to say,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   "This person, this person, this powerful person is inciting violence.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.320]   And we want to say we don't stand with that."
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:36.960]   I like that.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.000]   Because if you don't.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   And that's the same thing with all your friends.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.760]   Every individual should do that, right?
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.320]   You're complicit to racism.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.280]   If you don't say something when somebody says something racist,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.840]   then you're complicit.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.520]   I don't think he's asking for a whole lot here.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.720]   Personally.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.840]   I think that's the right.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.840]   And not only more than that, I'll get behind you.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.200]   I'll say, "That's the right thing to do."
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.000]   And it's just simply saying, "Look, we don't agree with that.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.680]   That's not right.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.360]   That's racist."
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.320]   And just like you said, Miss LePort, if this was something that happened in person,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.120]   you were, say, out at the park or what had you.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.200]   It'd be wrong not to.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.320]   Right.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.560]   So it's wrong for Facebook not to.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.320]   I think that that's fair.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.240]   That's a very reasonable stance.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.800]   And it also does not require them to do it.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.200]   They don't have to disapprove of everything on the platform.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.560]   Right.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.760]   This has impact.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.200]   It has virality.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.560]   It's from power.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.280]   There's a whole bunch of tests they can put it to to say,
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.040]   "Is this worth us talking about?"
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.400]   Now, if it's just something they don't like,
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.160]   they can, there are full rights to kill it, to bury it, to not promote it, all that.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.280]   But they know this is going to be seen.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.320]   Here's what I don't like about it, because if you do it as Facebook,
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.720]   it's somewhat an anonymous, you know, faceless group of editorial people.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.000]   I would like to see a name on it.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.920]   You could have an ethicist of Facebook.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.560]   It doesn't have to be Marx.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.360]   It could be that committee that they, they didn't have to be Marx.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.280]   But some, it should be somebody.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.480]   Somebody you can respond to.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.880]   Let's see how the argument I've had with them.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:15.280]   I've said to them in conversations I've had about regulation and other things.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.480]   After I did my Twitter COVID list, bit.ly/COVID-Twitter list,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.360]   Facebook is trying to go with institutions, newspapers, WHO.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.880]   I said, "You're Facebook.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.920]   You need human beings.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.320]   You need researchers and doctors and geneticists and human beings.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.400]   We can start to understand, listen to, respect, and believe in their authority.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.120]   You should be amplifying the expertise of individuals."
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.240]   So I agree with you, Leo.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.280]   I think that it should be some kind of human voice that says,
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.080]   "It's here, but you just ought to know that we think this is not the right way to behave."
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.360]   I like that.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.280]   I don't have a problem.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:53.760]   I don't have a problem.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.480]   You know who should do it?
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.840]   I'm serious, but I'm going to say it.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.400]   Cheryl.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.920]   You know, the voice that I would channel for that is Ant.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.200]   Because Ant is always a very reasonable person.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.320]   Yeah, you can't get mad at it.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:04.640]   Calm.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.320]   I try to be.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.560]   Yeah, you are.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.920]   You can't get mad at it.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.200]   I think I would just go, "Oh, you're right.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:13.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.160]   I'm probably."
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.920]   Right.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.520]   Because Ants called me out once or twice,
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.560]   but extremely, respectfully, gently,
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.760]   right?
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   That's what you want to model.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.880]   Now, somebody in the chat room is saying,
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.760]   "It's not going to help.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.680]   No, you can't change people by calling them names."
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.400]   This is not necessarily with the intent of changing the poster's post.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.200]   This is just to merely calling out,
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.720]   which you would expect in civilized society would happen.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.160]   If this wasn't on a screen,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.800]   if this wasn't on a phone or on a computer,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.960]   what would the reaction be?
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.840]   That's how I would look at it.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.560]   If this was out here in your neighborhood,
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.680]   right out there in the streets,
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.160]   just like you said, in the support talk to the neighbor,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.440]   what would the reaction be?
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.040]   How would you go about that?
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:03.520]   And you might--
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.080]   It's no different.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.200]   You might, as a Facebook user, be reading it and disagreeing,
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.120]   say, "No, no, I think that's appropriate."
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.360]   Maybe even add a comment saying, "I think it's appropriate."
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.600]   Or, "I don't get why that's racist,"
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   or, "I don't get why that's violent," or whatever.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   That's the conversation.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.360]   That's actually good.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.480]   That's what you want.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.120]   Right.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.320]   You want to have that.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.520]   It's not about two sides.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.240]   It's about the company having its own soul.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.600]   Facebook is controlled by Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.400]   so it is his decision to what he stands for,
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.800]   and what the company stands for, become co-equal.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.400]   But his employees are telling him,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.240]   "You better stand for something here."
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   If I'm called a friend of Facebook and Google and Twitter,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:44.640]   fine.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.920]   Then it's your friend's telling you,
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.680]   you ought to stand for something.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.760]   I guess that's really what Jack Dorsey did.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.040]   Yes.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.760]   And you look at--
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.600]   If you're at Facebook, it's tempting to say,
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.640]   "Oh, it's just too big."
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.400]   It's--
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.720]   We can't be put in the position of judging every post and having--
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.120]   True.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.240]   But we're not asking that.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.200]   We're not saying that.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.160]   Right.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.560]   We're saying, "Stand for something," and put that into the conversation,
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.840]   because you already are.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.440]   You're doing it imperceptibly.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.960]   You're doing it anonymously.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.560]   So maybe, because you've already taken that responsibility,
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.560]   you have more responsibility.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.440]   You have influence whether they want to believe it or not.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.440]   So why not use it?
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.400]   And me, man, and you know what?
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.680]   This is something we should be aware of.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.080]   We may not agree with what they choose to say.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.760]   True.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.320]   Right.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   Yeah, he might come along and say, "No, I'm sorry.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.960]   It's not as--
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.760]   I'm going to say out loud, this is not an excitement, and I support it."
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.400]   He can do that.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.760]   And that's okay.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.960]   I don't think he would.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.720]   But that's taking the side.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.440]   But that's okay.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:47.920]   I do.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.000]   That starts the conversation.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.840]   And really, that's the problem we have right now,
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.120]   is we've got polar opposites and no conversation at all happening.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.800]   This is why I keep arguing that Facebook lacks a North Star.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.840]   Yes.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.160]   The oversight board is supporting--
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:08.160]   is going to adjudicate a statute book without a constitution.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.560]   And Twitter doesn't fully have it yet either,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.720]   but like England, it's having an unwritten constitution
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.480]   and it starts to write it down by its actions.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.800]   Facebook has statutes.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.920]   No press.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.400]   We'll be happy to tell you no press, but incitement of violence?
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.520]   Well, if your president is okay, right?
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.800]   So they're getting their knickers and knots there,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.640]   whereas if they said we stand for respectful conversation,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:38.240]   we stand for not inciting things and making them worse in society.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.920]   We stand for dialogue that is respectful and form the productive.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.040]   And we're going to call it out.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.320]   Exactly.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.040]   When we see it.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.680]   We see somebody going against it, we're going to say--
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.720]   That's not--
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.520]   Not done that in the Philippines with Duterte.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.760]   Had they done that in Myanmar, would it have made a difference?
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.880]   Maybe not, but you would feel a lot better about Facebook.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   Exactly.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.880]   They could stand up a lot prior.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.960]   And so what I wrote a post about this a week ago,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.240]   which we talked about last week,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.320]   I said, should I have spoken up this way in Philippines and Myanmar?
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.280]   Yes, I should have.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.760]   It's very much like Martin E. Mima.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.840]   First, they came for the Philippines and I didn't do anything.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.680]   And then they came for Myanmar, they did it with him.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.680]   Now they come for us here in the US.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.960]   Well, okay, now I'm doing something.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.320]   So guilty.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:20.800]   Guilty.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.400]   Good.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.440]   Jeff, I think you finally--
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.720]   After three years of chewing on this,
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.200]   we've come up with a solution that I--
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.800]   Stacy's not going to believe it.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.520]   She's not going to believe it.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.720]   Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.600]   We came up with something.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.160]   What do you think?
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.000]   She said, "This is fear, guys are full of it."
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.960]   What do you think?
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.400]   We came up with something.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.840]   We could see her face now.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.520]   I don't know.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.080]   No, I think this is--
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.920]   What I like about it is it's kind of ethically right
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.320]   without putting Facebook in the big chair saying,
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.560]   "This is true, this is not true, this goes, this doesn't go."
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.480]   I don't think that's the right thing to do either.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.080]   And again, you're not talking about the world even.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.320]   You're talking about the use of Facebook.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:12.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.400]   What kind of world we want here?
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.720]   We want a world here where people are not going to be
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.360]   yelling at each other, where people are going to be trying to be constructed,
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.720]   where they're trying to be respectful,
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.640]   where they're not going to incite hatred.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.040]   Yes.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.000]   That's what our world is.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.480]   Sundar Pichai was one of the many speakers.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.760]   Did you see the 2020 commencement address,
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.600]   "Dear Class of 2020, this is so touching to me."
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.160]   They did a commencement celebration for all the poor high school kids,
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.000]   and I guess college kids graduating without getting to walk,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.360]   without getting to do anything.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:58.400]   They had everybody from President Obama, Michelle Obama.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:58.960]   I love this.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:04.640]   Here's Lizo playing the flute with the LA Philharmonic.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.880]   No shot, kid.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.360]   Carson's yelling right now that you're playing on YouTube video.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.720]   I've played two notes.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.480]   You got to see really awesome, really awesome.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.760]   And then they would, I like, this is just beautiful.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.280]   What I like is that they broke out all of the different,
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.320]   there's a playlist so you can see the highlights of it.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.560]   If you don't want to watch the whole thing, you can see 80 peris.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.680]   It's worth, boy, everybody had something to say.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   I thought it was quite beautiful.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.080]   And it's everybody from Lady Gaga to Mariah Carey,
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.920]   too.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.600]   I got to watch that.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.680]   Schitt's Creek featuring Mariah Carey.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.280]   That's going to be interesting.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.880]   Alicia Keys, I think Lizo with the New York Philharmonic.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.840]   That's hysterical.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.000]   Finneas remixed, U2's beautiful day.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.840]   This is all the stuff.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.720]   You know, if I were a high school senior, I'd want to hear it.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.560]   God, this graduation goes on forever.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.440]   Well, that's why it's good they broke it out into a playlist.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.000]   Look at this.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.600]   It's just everybody.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.720]   Everybody, this job.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.560]   I thought my sons was long.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.240]   Longer than you.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.960]   But Sundar Pichai was one of the people, the CEO.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.520]   Is he now, do we have to say CEO of Alphabet and Google?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.160]   I thought just Alphabet was enough because Alphabet comes along.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.720]   His title on the blog is the keyword blog, CEO of Google and Alphabet.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.120]   Oh, OK.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.640]   Interesting.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.040]   He said, "I'd never imagined I'd be given a commencement speech
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.200]   with no live audience from my backyard."
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.720]   I imagine that every day, Sundar.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.400]   You can draw some or not.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.560]   No, he's wearing a baseball jacket, which is pretty funny.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.280]   It's probably a Google baseball jacket.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.520]   So he says, "Let me skip right to the end of the speech
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.720]   and tell you what happens.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.560]   You will prevail."
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.600]   This is not really the end of the speech, so don't get too excited.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:01.840]   Right.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:07.600]   The reason I know you'll prevail is because so many others have done it before you.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.920]   The class of 1920 graduated into the end of the pan--
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.200]   another deadly pandemic, the class of 1970,
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.240]   graduated in the midst of the Vietnam War My class.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.360]   I was class of '73.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.600]   Same thing.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   Class of 2001 graduated just months before 9/11.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.440]   So be hopeful.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.840]   It's very conventional for every generation to underestimate
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.920]   the potential of the following one because they don't realize the progress
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.760]   of one generation becomes the foundational premise for the next.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.160]   And it takes a new set of people to come along and realize all the possibilities.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   You'd probably get along great with him, Jeff Jarvis, you optimist, you.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:55.680]   The great thing about the speech that I loved is that he said that his father spent
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.680]   a year's salary to body airplane ticket for him to go to Stanford.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.200]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.320]   It was his first time ever on a plane.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.960]   He says, "But when I eventually landed in California, things weren't as I imagined.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:15.120]   America was expensive. A phone call back home was more than $2 a minute.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.280]   A backpack cost the same as my dad's monthly salary in India.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.680]   And for all the talk about warm California beaches, the water was freezing cold.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.720]   It's true.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.120]   There he is.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.120]   Sundar is a graduate student at Stanford.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.800]   A bright spot for me during this time was computing.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   For the first time in my life, I could use a computer whenever I wanted to.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.280]   It completely blew my mind.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.560]   So yeah, this is a good speech.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.280]   I have to say, I thought this was all the speeches were good.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:47.440]   See, see.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:54.560]   But you know, I'll be honest, if you're speaking to a graduating class of 2020,
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.720]   you've got to be hopeful because you can't tell them the truth.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.040]   They would be depressing to say which is what is the truth.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.320]   Honestly, I mean, I feel my kids graduated from college last year.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.760]   They are, this is the worst possible time.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.200]   I know this is not the pandemic of 2020.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.760]   This is not those of us graduating in, you know, the Vietnam era,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.520]   facing the draft.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.040]   This is far worse.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.720]   Now, if you're if you're a black man,
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.200]   graduating, it's not.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.600]   It's just another, another century of oppression and violence.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.760]   I will say this.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:42.560]   I, you know, we were talking pre-show, you know, how I attended a local peaceful protest in March
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.960]   over the weekend.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.240]   And a detail that I left out was that was put together by a student here at Sonoma State.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.640]   Yeah, that's what I know.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.680]   This was, this was all a student and it was beautifully done.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.320]   And I can remember speaking there and I mentioned to my family,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.040]   I said, you know what?
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.840]   I know I've given the kids of today a hard time with how they don't know how to change
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.080]   a tire or change their own oil, like Mr. Jarvis, but seeing.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.920]   Hey, rub it in, rub it in.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:24.400]   But seeing that a teenager or a young young person could put together a beautiful rally
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.200]   in a beautiful peaceful protest like that.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:34.560]   That gave me hope, you know, that maybe these kids are trying to gear up and make things better
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.760]   on this planet.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.640]   The time we're finished for the show, we're going to make Leo just feel all
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.360]   hungry of you.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   I, I actually, I actually, of all the bad things that have happened in this,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.400]   in this bad timeline that we somehow got into,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.840]   the protests have given me such hope.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.560]   Because we have, it has been a bad 400 years.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:05.040]   And, and I have to say, you know, I remember waking up in 1968 to my clock radio, we, you know,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.400]   we, Bobby had just been shot and then hearing that MLK was shot.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:16.240]   And I just felt like, oh my God, the, it's, it's the worst, this is the worst ever.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.800]   And there have been, and you know, and Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and just it just keeps
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.280]   happening.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.200]   And then when we saw the video of George Floyd, it just keeps happening.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   But this reaction has been quantitatively and qualitatively different than I can remember,
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.160]   even the marches.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:41.680]   The marches, my dad marched, the march on Washington in 1968 when Martin Luther King gave that great
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.080]   speech.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.640]   He was there.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.760]   He was, when I got on the buses and went there from Rhode Island.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:53.040]   And I remember marching for racial equality and marching against the war in Vietnam as a young man.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:01.280]   This is so different and seems to be almost a universal feeling of we've, this time,
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.320]   we got to do, we can't let this keep happening.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.520]   So for the first time ever, I almost don't want to feel hope because my hopes have been dashed so
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:17.600]   many times. But for the first time ever, I feel like maybe I, this is a little bit of movement.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.080]   And you're, you're ageless.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.400]   But I have no idea how old you are.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.200]   I'm in my 40s. I'll say that.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.960]   So, because my, well, I'll do, I'm the old man.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.920]   Even older than Leo.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.640]   Not much.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.480]   No, not much.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.080]   And I wrote a piece for an Irish newspaper or Sunday that this was all the last stand of the
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.160]   old white man. And I say that as one. And I remember, you know, the 60s,
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.000]   regga, we're open 68. I'm reliving that now. And I feel like we haven't learned anything since.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.360]   So that's my kind of, it feels like 1968. I agree.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.200]   I can remember you can remember it too.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.080]   Watching the Chicago Democratic convention.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:00.400]   Right.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.080]   And it looked so much the same police with riot gear, the same batons wailing on protesters.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.600]   It looks so similar.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.520]   Political strife.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.440]   You have racial strife.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.800]   You have police violence.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.560]   You have rocket shots.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.400]   So my question to you, Anne, is that's my memory of kind of the early days of the fight.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   What sticks in your mind from your youth, given your generation.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.200]   Yeah, I agree the way are.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.280]   Is there, is there, is there an event?
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.320]   There was one event that I did not attend.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.880]   Back in 95 or 96. And it was that million man March.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   See, I did not attend because quite frankly, I wasn't interested.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.800]   And I remember some of my teammates were wanting to go and they did go.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:04.000]   But before that, I have memories of KK parades in South Carolina.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.840]   I remember seeing stuff like that pretty regularly.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:17.440]   But with all of that going on, I can remember looking at the resilience of my mother and my father
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.080]   and some of my other family members that said, you know what, get your crap together,
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.440]   get the work and be a better person in the story.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.960]   That's what I loved.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.600]   Cornell Wild was on the CNN last night.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.280]   He actually made Harrison Cooper cry.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:44.480]   And it ties to at the end of John Oliver's this week tonight, he played a riveting clip from a
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:52.080]   black woman saying, you never saw a black KKK. You broke the social contract.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.480]   But we didn't riot.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.640]   Well, we didn't turn on you.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.040]   We just kept on.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:08.240]   And it was so moving, the Anderson Cooper was bawling as was I.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:17.200]   Because of the beautiful spirit and love coming from the black community in the face of such hate.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.760]   It's so inspiring.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.120]   And I just hope, you know, by the way, good news, this just happened.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.880]   Amazon has now agreed to ban the use of its face recognition technology for the year.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:34.400]   This, of course, following IBM saying, we're not going to do it anymore.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.400]   Because, of course, all of this face recognition technology is very much biased against people of
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.760]   color. Yeah.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.120]   And so now that they're going to ban it, let's hope that they're saying, you know what,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:51.280]   we're going to bring in some more teammates that can help with this, that can help make it better,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.640]   that, you know, yeah.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.120]   Yep.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.200]   But more importantly to me, this is Amazon, which fought this tooth and nail, finally realizing,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.360]   you know what, the tide is turning week by the North Star.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.920]   We can't keep doing this.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.120]   Maybe I'm a cynic.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.200]   Maybe it's because it's bad for business.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.640]   Oh, no, we better do this.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.320]   Maybe because they did find there a little bit of conscious.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.280]   I don't conscious.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:15.840]   I don't know.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.880]   But that's why I feel like there's hope.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.960]   For the first time in my lifetime, there may be some hope.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   Actually, that's not true because I had hope in the early 70s, late 60s, early 70s,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.640]   that maybe we could change things.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.240]   There was that sense.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.360]   But then our generation screwed it up.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.840]   Our generation didn't do the things that we promised we were going to do.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.520]   Our generation got in control.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.360]   Our generation of old white men got in control and didn't do anything.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.480]   That's what depresses me about this is that it feels, the fact that it feels so much like
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.880]   68 means that there should have been a step change.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.160]   Not this task, but so we hope and pray and need to commit to making a step change.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:58.960]   There was a fast day.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:05.600]   So the editor of Born Appetee had to resign because he was in brown face in a photo that
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.720]   was found on social media.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.160]   He and his wife years ago pretended to be Puerto Rican.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:18.720]   So the staff of Born Appetee just put up a letter to the public that I think is very good
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:25.680]   and confesses the sins of the magazine and has concrete things that they say that they're going to do.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.680]   One thing that we see in journalism all the time is an editor or a professor says,
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.720]   "Oh, that story is not big enough.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.440]   It's just a trend.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.360]   It's just you and your people."
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.720]   That's the kind of stuff that went on.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.440]   And they used low level people underpaid at Born Appetee to be in video so they could look better.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.080]   And they didn't pay them.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.120]   They didn't pay them.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:45.680]   They didn't pay them.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.480]   They didn't pay the black people.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.840]   They only paid the white people.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.640]   It's like so appalling.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.560]   So appalling.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.240]   Oh my God.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.920]   I just want to say right now, Ant, we're going to start paying you because...
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.440]   I appreciate it.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.240]   It's wrong.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.520]   No, I love Epicurel, which is part of their family.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.880]   And I had no idea.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.600]   I am so glad this is the a long overdue apology and where we go from here.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.720]   This is really good.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.560]   And I think what I tweeted was that it's not just Born Appetee, it's journalism.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.440]   It's journalism schools.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.640]   It's my journalism school.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.520]   We have work to do.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.480]   It's us.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.800]   And this had concrete things to do.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.640]   Then the president of Connie asked him what his response was just more PR blather.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.920]   The model should have been to go down everything that that staff said and said,
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.480]   "Yes, we're going to do it.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.920]   And here's how when we're going to do it."
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.320]   And it should have been that instead it was just,
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.760]   "Oh, we're going to have a lot of them.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.080]   We're going to have better discussions."
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.640]   You know, it's all platitudes.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.200]   Wesley Faulkner was on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.960]   And I was talking about Tim Cook's beautiful letter to the public that's on apple.com about racism.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.600]   And he said, "That was okay, but I really preferred Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's letter because
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.000]   Satya said, "It's us.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.440]   We take responsibility.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.920]   Here's what we are going to do."
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.520]   And that really, you need to say that.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.440]   You need to say, "Okay, we blew it.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.360]   And here's what we're going to do.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.640]   Here's how we're going to make it better."
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.080]   And I think I hope this isn't just PR from a bunch of companies.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.880]   Tom will love to do it now.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.440]   Josh?
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.240]   Well, sometimes, you know, sometimes a desire to preserve the bottom line
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.680]   pushes you in the right direction.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.200]   And you know how it is if you don't feel like smiling, but you smile,
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.600]   sometimes you kind of start to feel better anyway.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.400]   Maybe that's the upshot of it.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.560]   But I'm just thrilled to see Amazon saying, "Okay, we're going to step back on recognition."
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560]   That is good, though.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.440]   But again, I have no problem with the idea and technology of facial recognition,
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.200]   because that could help things from an efficiency standpoint,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.440]   depending on what your business model is.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.480]   But when it comes time to train these systems,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.640]   you need to have people that are just not sitting in a box,
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.200]   people that are a little more well-rounded,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.440]   and can see it from all different perspectives,
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.400]   you know, not just some white guy from San Francisco.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   Speaking of white guys from San Francisco,
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.440]   Jack Dorsey's made Juneteenth the permanent company holiday.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.560]   Juneteenth, which is on June 14th.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.760]   Symbolic the good symbol.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.040]   It's a big symbol, you know?
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.760]   Jun 14th is the anniversary of none of the...
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   I always thought it was the Emancipation Proclamation.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.560]   It's not.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.640]   It's the end of the Civil War and the final actual freeing.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.880]   It was the reading of slave release.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.400]   The release of the Civil War, yeah.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.480]   So that's coming up in four days, and it will be celebrated.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.880]   I'm sorry, June 19th, I said the 14th.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.920]   It's coming up in nine days.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.960]   Yes, the 19th.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.920]   Sorry, Juneteenth.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.880]   Yeah, Juneteenth.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.720]   So they're going to make that a company holiday in the US.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.600]   I think that's great.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.000]   Maybe take some time for education as well as barbecuing.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.280]   Yep.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:18.400]   All right, let's take a break,
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.000]   because there's more to talk about.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.480]   But what I like to do, there's a lot more to talk about.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.480]   What I like to do at this point,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.840]   we got a change log coming up.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.920]   We will get to that, is give both you and Jeff a chance
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.920]   to pick a story that I...
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.440]   So we get, make sure we get everything
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.960]   that you wanted to talk about in.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.440]   So why don't we think about what you want to talk about,
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:39.920]   both of you.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.280]   And I...
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.400]   We got a think, Aunt.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.280]   We got a think.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.080]   You don't have to think.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:44.560]   Just go...
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.200]   You're at a point.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.880]   Random numbers are earlier.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.760]   Dart.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.280]   I don't care how you come up with it.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.200]   I'll do line 91, whatever's on it.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.240]   Beautiful.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.800]   And we do pay, Aunt.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.520]   If anybody believes that we didn't,
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.200]   yeah, I apologize.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.720]   Yes, I do get paid.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.600]   I am happy, happy, happy employee of Twitch.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   There's actually people in the chat room
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.880]   who are saying he doesn't get paid.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.360]   No.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.080]   He doesn't get paid.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:16.080]   Oh, no.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.600]   Oh, my God.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.400]   I am a happy, careful what you say in the world.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.000]   Save us from the literal London.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.240]   Well, people might believe it.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.400]   You know, who would have believed Bonapati
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.280]   was not paying black people for their videos,
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.200]   but was paying the white people for the videos.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.320]   I mean, who would have believed that?
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.120]   Churchill.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:35.680]   Churchill.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.240]   I understand.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.640]   I look like an old biased old white man.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.960]   I say white!
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   I know it's not good.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.920]   I know it's not good.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.680]   It's not good.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.840]   I'm thrilled to see the US Navy and the Marines
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.400]   take down the Confederate battle flag everywhere.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.000]   NASCAR.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.600]   NASCAR, just that's a shock.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.840]   Every time I see, what was that?
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.800]   The Daisy Dukes, the Dukes of Hazard.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.680]   Every Tazor with a battle flag on that car, I think.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.360]   Yep.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.800]   That's a big part of NASCAR.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.840]   I'm shocked.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.280]   But that's what I mean.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.520]   I feel like the times might be changing.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.760]   Let me say this about NASCAR.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:25.440]   I used to watch NASCAR a lot because of where I'm from.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.040]   And my grandfather was a mechanic for most,
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.240]   pretty much all of my life.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.080]   So he talked about cars.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.280]   And when the races would come on,
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.000]   him and his community,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.840]   or friends, or whatever, they would watch the races.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.640]   But they didn't care who won.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.560]   They cared about what car won.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.600]   Was it a Chevrolet?
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.400]   Was it a Ford?
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.680]   That kind of thing.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.320]   So I understood that.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.440]   Now you fast forward 20 years,
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.000]   and there's still a little bit of that in NASCAR.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.600]   Fast forward another 10 years.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   Not so much of that.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.920]   NASCAR has changed a lot,
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.760]   where the drivers are not necessarily from Rockingham,
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.840]   North Carolina, or Greenville, South Carolina.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.640]   A lot of them are coming from Sonoma, California,
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.520]   and stuff like that.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.800]   It's more like F1 or other kinds of racing.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.400]   It's more about the star drivers and the teams.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.600]   It's not as regional as it used to be.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.040]   A lot of those tracks closed down because it just wasn't selling.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.560]   It comes from the roots at NASCAR,
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.880]   which is some good old boy brought his car
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.760]   with a Confederate battle flag on the hood.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.720]   Let's race.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.800]   Let's race.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.840]   Moonshine and on the beaches of Daytona.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.360]   That's all it was.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.760]   But yeah, for them to have the flags removed.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.400]   That's shocking.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.440]   That doesn't surprise me.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.840]   It doesn't surprise me because it's not the same NASCAR.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.320]   Had they tried that maybe 15 years ago,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.440]   it would have been a mess.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.880]   It would have been a mess.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.360]   Well, it is.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.000]   At least it was until recently that I think
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.640]   probably still is the fastest growing sport in America.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.560]   One run.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.680]   Is it?
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.880]   Not doing as well as they used to.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.920]   They're trying.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.200]   That's just trying.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:09.600]   Okay.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.680]   While we're on sports,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.600]   I mean, tip of the hat.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.000]   Oh, great.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.240]   I never get taught sports on Twitch.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.120]   I never got sports because I don't know.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.840]   Are you going through withdrawal?
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.800]   This must be very...
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.280]   This is the hardest part of quarantine, isn't it?
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.360]   Well, for me, it's okay because when football is in off season,
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.880]   I watch a lot of sports reruns.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.320]   So I watch old football games.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.680]   So I always get my fix.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.560]   I'm always with it.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.400]   But you're not going to feel so good come fall.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   I hope I'm feeling good come fall.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.520]   That was a gridded teeth.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.280]   I better, man.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.360]   I better, man.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.160]   I try like...
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:57.040]   I'll sharpen from the pulpit in the funeral,
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.600]   saying it is time to make up to Colin Kaepernick.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.360]   It's not enough to make a YouTube video.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.480]   Oh, sorry.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.000]   Absolutely.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.040]   He was right.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.200]   This man created the symbol of a movement.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.560]   He was right.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.760]   I have thoughts on that.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.840]   And people are going to disagree with me on it.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.200]   Yes, the NFL should
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.720]   go to him and say, "Look, yeah, we screwed up.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.040]   We were totally, totally, totally wrong."
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.440]   And there are some people that are going to say,
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.200]   they should have this big old campaign announcement.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.160]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.760]   I think that's something that should be done in private with
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.840]   maybe two witnesses, if you will.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.640]   The same way they went about it with the court case
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.400]   and the settlement and things like that.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.240]   Because personally, I don't think it should be
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.200]   is showman-like on television to where it looks like it was just a PR.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.360]   Using him the other way.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:54.640]   Right.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   So I say do it, but do it to where there's maybe two witnesses,
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.320]   no cameras.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.080]   That way, you know it's sincere or not.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.080]   Or at least for me, it gives you a better sense of it being sincere
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.040]   and not being in the public eye of all of the flashing lights
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.720]   and cameras and things like that.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.840]   Because they totally did screw this up.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.320]   And they were totally wrong on this.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.360]   Because what he did, he was just doing a peaceful protest.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.160]   People are going to think that he was just respecting the flag.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.760]   It had nothing to do with the flag.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.040]   It was all about the police brutality.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:35.360]   And the idea came from a military veteran to Neil.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.240]   Colin asked what would be a respectful way.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:38.560]   Right.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.440]   So you wanted to do it, you know, and out of respect for the military
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.760]   and respect for, you know, the community.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.520]   But he was blackballed and openly blackballed.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   Because there are a ton of quarterbacks in the NFL that don't ever get to play.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.440]   Because they're either back up or to just, you know,
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.160]   a role player on the practice squad.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.920]   He could very easily be on the practice squad somewhere at the very least.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.320]   But he actually could start somewhere too.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.920]   There's a lot of bad quarterback play.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.200]   He took us to the Super Bowl.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   I'm not, I still have my number 7 49ers jersey.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.800]   I should start wearing that with pride.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.680]   Right.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.040]   Well, since you're the only real man in Jock here.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.240]   Oh, you're almost as bad as I am.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.200]   I'm going to stop you.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200]   This guy.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.240]   How long has it been since he's played?
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.320]   And is there any chance that he still can have physical low-jow to be able to,
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:42.480]   if he started, if we're back in the fall, can he possibly be in shape to play?
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.400]   He could play.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.560]   He had a camp for him.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.520]   They had an audition camp for him not so long ago.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.280]   Nobody hired him at that time.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.000]   I think still probably because of his political.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.160]   Right. It was still political then.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.080]   But he's clearly enough in shape to make camp.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.200]   But a lot of those guys are, they work out so often because it's just,
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.960]   as I was telling my family members, when it comes to playing sports,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.040]   you get a certain discipline and it just doesn't leave.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.800]   You just wake up for me.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.120]   I can't help but to do push-ups when a commercial comes on on TV.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.640]   It's just there.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.840]   So these people, they're in shape.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.040]   So you don't have to worry about that.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.320]   Richard Sherman says Kaepernick could still play at the highest level.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.040]   And deserves a time.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:29.920]   I wouldn't doubt it at all.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.560]   Good.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.560]   And Tarnit?
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.600]   He's only 32.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.160]   He's not, I mean, he played for six seasons for the Niners.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.800]   I think the last game he played was in that Super Bowl.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.160]   I can't remember if he got to play with that.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.840]   I think he played one more after that but lost a starting job, if I remember right.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.320]   I think so.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.520]   Your wife would know more than me.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.800]   She's a national 49er.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.320]   She was no one's ironic.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.640]   I remember going to a preseason game in that 2016 season and Kaepernick,
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.360]   you know, was okay a little late in the game.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.600]   So he wasn't playing against the first stringers but he took the ball and ran 70 yards
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.400]   for a touchdown.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.240]   And I said, wow, I like this guy.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:14.800]   Yeah, I feel.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.160]   I like this guy.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:20.320]   I was really thrilled when he got to start.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:24.880]   And he really played very well in the last few games, but she was never a fan.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.200]   She said, no, he doesn't do his progressions fast enough.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.000]   He's not.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.840]   He's not as alert on the field as he needs to be.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.040]   She's tough though.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.400]   And at that time, I have to agree with it from that standpoint because playing that position,
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.360]   you can't just tuck it and run every single time because you want to have some longevity
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.520]   and be able to play next week.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.720]   So limit those hits.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.840]   Go through your progressions.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.880]   And she doesn't like, she doesn't like the new guy.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.280]   Either.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.560]   So it also took us to the Super Bowl.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.440]   This is tough.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.080]   She's tough.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.280]   She's really tough.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.360]   He has somewhat of the same problem.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:06.160]   So no Kaepernick was a free agent that season and no one signed him because of politics.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.360]   Oh, the politics.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.200]   And he and there was no question.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:16.400]   Here's a guy came on halfway through a season, took a team to the Super Bowl and he doesn't get signed.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.920]   Well, he's owed back pay by the end.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.960]   Well, they settled.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.080]   I know no one knows how much for, but I imagine the NFL games.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.800]   I hope the NFL gave them some significant amount of money, but that's not really the point.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.840]   They settle for a decent amount.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.320]   Mark Gericos is his lawyer.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.920]   And I believe they talked about it on his podcast.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.400]   Oh, really?
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.880]   Oh, you're not supposed to, of course.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.240]   Right.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.480]   That's one of those deals.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.920]   Well, I thank you, Em, for that.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.240]   Sports of sport,
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.480]   media lesson for me.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.240]   Sportball fascinating to me.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.840]   We need a bumper.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.520]   We need a bumper for a sports segment.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.400]   We have a bumper.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.680]   Can you get it for us, John?
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.360]   Do you have the football bumper?
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.720]   Oh, it's, is it Jeff or John?
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.880]   Jeff, I can't tell with a mask.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.680]   Mr. Brockman.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.200]   Mr. Brockman.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.640]   Mr. Brockman is in the house and we used to have a nice little football bumper.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.920]   Kevin would know how to do it.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.040]   That's so mean.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:17.840]   Oh, he's mean.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:18.880]   That's so mean.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.840]   Oh, that means.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.040]   Jeff, turn off his camera.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.960]   Ever tell a story about getting a vasectomy?
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.480]   There you go.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:24.880]   Yes.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   Yes.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.040]   Yes, I won't.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.480]   I'm lying on the table.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.920]   You're awake when you get a vasectomy.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.960]   I'm lying on the table.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.880]   Well, I want to hear this.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.520]   Ah!
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.200]   There it is.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.400]   And the doctor's starting to sweat a little bit.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.440]   He can't, he's something.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.440]   He can't quite, he got half of it done,
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.240]   but not the other half.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.280]   I can't quite.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.880]   And my wife at the time said,
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.280]   it's okay.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.800]   We'll go get a urologist and he can finish the job.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   And the doctor jumped.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.760]   Man, he fixed it.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.400]   That's right.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.040]   That's right.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.120]   That was a good trick.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.640]   That was a good trick.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:00.960]   Motivation.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.680]   He played three seasons after the Super Bowl.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.040]   Your wife insults the doctor as he's got a knife on you down there.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   I think something else was happening.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.880]   Come to think of it.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.360]   Come to think of it.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.640]   What was she thinking?
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.720]   She was thinking money talk and she walks.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.160]   She humbled him.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:24.880]   She humbled him.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.960]   Let me get that right.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.280]   Because I thought that that, okay.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.680]   I thought he played the following year,
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.600]   but ended up losing his starting job.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.080]   Yeah, he must have played because he wasn't taking a knee
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.600]   after the Super Bowl appearance, right?
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.640]   That's right.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:40.880]   So,
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:47.920]   I can't remember.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.360]   He started taking a knee in 2016.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:58.240]   And at that point, he became a free agent after the season,
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.680]   but went unsigned.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.440]   So his Super Bowl was 2012.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.600]   So yeah, he played, I'm sorry, I apologize.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.080]   Yeah, because Alex Smith got a concussion
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.600]   and Kaepernick took over Alex Smith.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.800]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.840]   And he took the Niners in the 2012 season.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.960]   See, that was in 20th.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.760]   So I was confusing.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.000]   The 2012 season, Super Bowls in 2013.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.040]   And that Kaepernick played in 2013.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.480]   And he played for three more years.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:31.600]   But he was a free agent and then no one hired him.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.760]   Because in 2016, he started taking a knee.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.640]   Anyway, enough history, enough about my vasectomy.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.360]   Let's move on.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.800]   We have a spot, so you wanted to think.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.720]   Well, they don't want to be here now after that.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.360]   Are you kidding?
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.200]   They're saying, I'm trying to give him a little buffer.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.960]   Is it hot?
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.240]   Where are you now?
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.200]   And is it just a little?
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.000]   How'd you like to get a copy of Doom on your Chromebook?
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.080]   Look at that.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.120]   Doom or Doom 2?
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:06.480]   Google.com/chromebooks/perks.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.960]   Here's some Chromebook perks.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.720]   You can get Doom and Doom 2.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.120]   It's only a $5 value.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.160]   You don't get too excited.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.840]   But even still, I wouldn't think about it.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.600]   That's some nice horsepower
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.200]   being able to push graphics.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.760]   Yeah, the Chromebook could play it even as impressive.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.760]   That's pretty bad going.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.240]   Cool.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.760]   Also, Fallout Shelter, the Elder Scrolls Legends.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.040]   Stardew Valley.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.600]   Calm Premium for 30 days.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.440]   Lineage 2.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.200]   Oh, there's a lot of perks in here.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:41.680]   Wow.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.640]   That's nice.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.600]   There's something for you.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.640]   And VSCO.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.960]   You got a year's membership at VSCO.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.640]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.840]   Remember that, Visco?
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.480]   Remember those?
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.000]   Lots of filters.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.360]   That's right.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.640]   I'm hoping for a new Pixelbook come in the fall.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.080]   There was speculation.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.920]   Some of the things they're seeing go by with the code names
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.960]   and the timing.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   It's been three years this fall.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.760]   Oh, man.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.720]   Can you believe me?
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   This is visible.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.560]   Mr. Jarvis, what's going to do it for you this year, though?
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.720]   What's it going to take?
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.840]   You're still waiting and holding out.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.560]   And they're planning--
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.920]   I'm hoping for a Pixelbook.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.320]   My keyboard is getting a little wonky right now.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320]   I don't know if I'll make it,
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.000]   but I'm hoping for a Pixelbook.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:24.640]   Full Pixelbook.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.800]   You're wanting a Google branded hardware.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.440]   I love that.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.560]   I love my Pixelbook.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.520]   I think they do a good job.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.720]   Okay.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:34.320]   Just checking Kevin Tofel's about Chromebooks.com
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.200]   to see if there's any rumors we ought to know about.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.400]   There's a deep place to go.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.240]   I don't see anything.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.400]   No, this is one room around there.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.640]   It just seemed like it's time, isn't it?
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.160]   I have my Pixelbook right here.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.320]   I really-- it's a very nice device.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.560]   Do your boys use Chromebooks in school?
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.240]   And or--
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:54.720]   Yes, sir.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.120]   They do.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.160]   Sir.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.880]   I think it's a great school computer, honestly.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.000]   So did Michael.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.480]   Yeah, where it's totally fine.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.160]   And then when they get home,
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.360]   they can just log into any session on any computer.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:07.680]   Right.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.160]   On.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.120]   They still have to use it.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.120]   Yeah, I think that's smart.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:11.440]   All right.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.160]   I put the Chrome unbox story in the chat on the rundown.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:14.560]   Oh, good.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:14.720]   All right.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.000]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   First a word from the folks who pay for this lovely studio,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.920]   the LastPass Studios,
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.560]   here in beautiful Petaluma, California, LastPass.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.960]   Everybody knows LastPass is a password manager,
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   but really it's so much more.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.600]   We use LastPass.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.760]   I've used LastPass personally from one 10 years.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.640]   So does so does pretty much everybody.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.200]   I know, including our own security guru, Steve Gibson.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.760]   Now, Steve, he's a tough audience.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.160]   He had to actually interview the guy who wrote it,
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.440]   Joe Seagrest.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.240]   Get a look at the code and everything, but that's when Steve said,
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.200]   two thumbs up.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.960]   I give it my certification.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.680]   The Gibson Seal of Approval, he's doing everything right.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.280]   That was some years ago.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   We didn't want to episode on how LastPass works.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.280]   We started using LastPass for business,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.200]   the enterprise version a few years ago,
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.640]   one of our engineers put all the passwords on a public web page,
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.680]   because he couldn't remember them.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.800]   I thought, I'm going to help you.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.120]   We're going to get LastPass.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.240]   It's gone a lot farther.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.480]   In fact, I'm so glad we used LastPass Enterprise,
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.560]   because as we send employees home,
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.480]   suddenly they're working from home.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.480]   They're logging in from their home computers
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:30.080]   onto our bank accounts, our websites, our databases,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.240]   our production system, everything.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.000]   They've got the keys to the kingdom.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.440]   I'm really glad it's protected by LastPass.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.000]   LastPass has done a lot in Enterprise to make it more than just a password manager.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.680]   Of course, it's a great password manager.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.280]   If you're in the IT department, you'll be glad to know.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.280]   It ensures oversight of shadow IT.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.000]   You've got enforceable policies across all password protected sites.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.120]   So for instance, we require two factor on their master password.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.000]   We have minimum password requirements, things like that.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.640]   They've added more.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.000]   They've got single sign-on now, more than 1,200 single sign-on apps.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.120]   That makes it really easy for employees to use something
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.600]   without having to remember a password.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.960]   I don't even use a password.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.000]   You just say, "Yes, on the phone.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yeah, that's me.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.600]   I'm trying to log in."
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.560]   And boom, they're in.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.160]   And of course, again, IT has centralized control.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.240]   Always knows exactly who's accessing what from where that's really important.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.920]   They've also added multi-factor authentication.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.960]   Of course, they have two factor,
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.040]   and I've always used two factor with LastPass.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.560]   You can use an authenticator, but now they've got biometric.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.320]   You can use fingerprint or face.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.760]   I love unlocking my LastPass with Face ID.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.360]   It makes it very easy.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.480]   They even go beyond that.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.800]   They now use contextual factors, things like IP address or geolocation.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.720]   Again, it's all about authentication.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.960]   It's all about making sure the person who's using your business resources is the right person.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.400]   You've got to be thinking, as you're sending employees home,
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.400]   as you're dealing with the crisis, you've got to be thinking about
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.040]   additional layers of defense beyond the password.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.360]   And of course, LastPass does everything right.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.480]   That's what Steve verified.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.120]   They never send, but they don't even store the master password.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.800]   They don't know it, which is good, because if LastPass can't access your data,
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.000]   no one else can, right?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.600]   Data is only decrypted on your device locally,
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.360]   and it's encrypted before it sinks to LastPass.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.400]   So it's sent encrypted.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:24.960]   It's encrypted.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.240]   It stays in place encrypted,
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.720]   and only you have access to it.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.960]   That's really, really important.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.520]   And by the way, every device, Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, every browser,
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.520]   I use LastPass everywhere I am.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.240]   It's the first program I install when I'm setting up a new system.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.320]   A 256-bit AES encryption, that's the best you can get.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.720]   LastPass protects, but, and this is really important for business,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.840]   it also provides a seamless workflow for your employees.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.600]   It's convenient and secure, and that's a tough thing to do.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:59.200]   LastPass can help make remote work simple and secure.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.160]   Go to lasspass.com/twit.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.960]   Find out how they can help your business stay productive and secure,
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.800]   no matter what happens.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.440]   lasspass.com/twit.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.400]   Thank you, LastPass.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.360]   They're pretty much keeping us alive right now.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.320]   So thank you, LastPass.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   Thank you, LastPass.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.240]   All right, now I don't know if you remember,
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.120]   but way back when I said pick a story, any story.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.600]   Mine is number 98.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.440]   Number 98.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.480]   Number 98.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.840]   Number 98.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.360]   Amazon, SUSE.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.000]   Oh yeah, we talked about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.760]   Brian Hall, because he took a job after leaving Amazon because
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.440]   of the face recognition software, which I think is really interesting.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.840]   He left and he took a job doing kind of the same thing,
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:00.880]   marketing at Google, cloud marketing at Google and Amazon says,
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.200]   you have an uncompede.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.040]   Right.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:11.680]   Did you just, I triggered something.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.880]   I was saying, you fired me.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.560]   Somebody's talking to me.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.240]   He was apparently a Microsoft effect.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.520]   The reason we talked about on Windows Weekly,
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.760]   very well respected at Microsoft did a lot of good and interesting things.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:29.760]   He went to work 18 months ago at, as Vice President of Product Marketing,
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.360]   quit along with others because he wasn't happy with Amazon's
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.840]   treatment of its workers.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.640]   Not it wasn't about face recognition, it was a treatment of workers.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.800]   And then got a job at Google, Amazon's suing saying,
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.880]   you signed an 18 month non-compete.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.880]   Now that's not enforceable in California.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.800]   Don't tell Aunt that.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.600]   That's not-
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.120]   We'll see that.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.080]   See, there was that caveat, but then there was also the caveat in that piece that mentions
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:09.040]   he spoke with another one of the members of leadership at Amazon that made it seem like it was,
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:14.320]   it was okay that he went ahead and took a job at Google.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.360]   And when I read that, I'm thinking, have you lost your mind?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.120]   You get that crap in writing, dude.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.360]   Yeah. Apparently, AWS Vice President of Worldwide Management,
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:29.040]   Ariel Kellman told him, oh yeah, that non-compete, that's not enforceable.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.320]   Well, Amazon's going to try and force it.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.960]   She'd also said she'd never seen Amazon attempt to enforce the clause against a marketing employee.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   So Hall thought, okay, I guess I can do it.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:50.960]   So I guess non-competes certainly legal in Washington state, but I was always told maybe,
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.880]   maybe just as mistakenly that non-competes are not enforceable in California.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.960]   We don't actually make our host signed contracts anymore.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.520]   We used to.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:08.240]   Let's see, what gets me is there are people that are against these non-competes, and
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.360]   then there's people like me.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.840]   I have no problem with the non-compete, at least with the spirit of it.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.240]   It's because you're an honorable person.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.400]   Well, I mean, this is competition.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:24.160]   Business is business, and business usually means competition with the other people within the same
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.320]   line of work that you're in.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.840]   You don't want to necessarily have your best players, if you will,
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.680]   leave your team to go to your competing team and end up whipping your butt.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.080]   So you have to figure out a way to try to at least level the playing field and keep them from doing
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:42.400]   that.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.720]   And I think that makes perfect sense.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:49.360]   I don't know if the actual term should be two years or 18 months.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.200]   I don't know how they come up with those terms, but it makes sense for them to say, hey,
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.760]   you can't go work for our competitor, direct competitor for X amount of days or X amount of
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.800]   months or something like that.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.360]   It just makes sense because of all of the security knowledge that you may have or other
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.800]   company secrets that you may have that could be of a disadvantage if it comes from one of your
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.680]   competitors.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.280]   I'm a hold you to this, aunt.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.080]   We don't.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:27.600]   I mean, I think the thinking and the reason why California doesn't allow it is because
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.800]   it keeps you from shopping yourself and getting the best job possible.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.120]   So if I have a non compete with you, I could say you can't work anywhere else for 18 months.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.120]   That means if somebody came to you with a better offer, you couldn't take it.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.600]   And so that makes sense.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.120]   Yeah, that's why it's considered illegal.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.840]   But you're an honorable person.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.760]   The reason we don't do contracts and we used to make our employees on contracts,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.840]   but we realized what we're going to do to sue you.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:01.280]   We have one employee, literally one of our hosts signed a contract with us and the next day quit.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.840]   He's like a three year contract and they quit.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.200]   And Lisa and I went, well, what's good is the contract?
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.880]   Right.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.040]   Because I'm not going to sue.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.560]   That would be terrible.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.160]   Yeah, what's my goal in suing getting them to come back to work?
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.520]   Oh, that's a good way to make a friend.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.760]   So we just, we just, you know, we don't.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.080]   But we used to say things like, you know, we'd, and I think we've told you this verbally,
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.720]   we'd appreciate it if you let us know before you do a show for somebody else or something like that.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.080]   But yeah, and that makes perfect sense to me.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.720]   And I think that's just more like common sense, but maybe you just think it's honor.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.560]   He wasn't unhappy.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.600]   He just got a better job.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.680]   I guess he got a better job.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.560]   I didn't think it was better.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:54.560]   Anyway, anyway, as a talent, I've always had awful, I have a contract with premier,
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:00.480]   awful contracts, you know, but I don't, I don't know how I can understand why this person
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.600]   this vice president who by the way is no longer an Amazon told him, you can quit.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:08.800]   Nobody's going to sue you because that's kind of what you'd expect.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.280]   Why would they?
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   Why would they want to?
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.480]   Let's say here, let's move on to Jeff.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.520]   So I have a quick story.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.800]   Yeah, one 14.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.400]   Since we're playing that game, I like it.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.400]   As it's really short, it's only a tweet.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.920]   It's a tweet.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.160]   That's all it is is a tweet tweet from Twitter sharing an article can spark conversation.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.680]   So you may want to read it before you tweet it.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.240]   Yeah, we know that a great percentage of articles of retweets and a Facebook
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:45.680]   reshars are just shared because of the headline of the picture, not because people read it.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.600]   Right?
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:55.680]   So, so Twitter is going to do what I think Facebook does behind the scenes was they see
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.960]   whether or not you've actually clicked off and read the link before you share it.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.760]   Oh, that's true.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.880]   Facebook, do that really?
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.440]   Facebook, yeah.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.360]   Facebook uses that as they say.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.720]   They'll say you can't share that.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:07.440]   No, they can share it, but no, they're not going to see it.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:14.400]   Oh, see, they'll they'll they'll factor that in as a way to say whether you're just doing
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.240]   the headline or whether you've actually read it.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.120]   They said that out loud.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.960]   So Twitter doesn't really promote that much, but it's trying to urge you to do that.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.680]   Now, there's plenty of times when I will have read an article earlier in the day,
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.200]   and then somebody writes about it and they link to it and they say something about it.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.240]   And I say, yeah.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.760]   And you know, I agree.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.240]   I read that article and Twitter didn't know I read it.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.680]   So it's not foolproof.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:41.840]   Gabs response, gab.com's response to Twitter.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.720]   We're not going to do this because we don't treat our people like children.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.520]   Oh, geez.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.400]   Gab, of course, the home of neo-nazis everywhere.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.680]   Boy.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.240]   That is a problem because I think a lot of times people,
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.200]   headlines often don't accurately reflect the contents of the story.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:01.920]   I don't know.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.160]   It's so annoying, so annoying.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.680]   Yeah, they really should do a better job of that.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.320]   But usually it's a different person often, right?
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.360]   Writing the headline.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:09.920]   Yes.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.160]   Yes.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.320]   So.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.080]   You know, but what about the people like I see where
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.600]   mega-moronin on this tweet says, you know what, none of her
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.920]   or New York Times or Washington Post are her subscriptions.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.600]   They're not tied to a Twitter account.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.280]   So how would you know if I read it?
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.040]   You know, with it.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.160]   That's a good point.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:30.960]   How would they know?
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.000]   Right.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:42.160]   So the presumption is you're on Twitter and you see something you want to retweet it.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.880]   And since you didn't click it before you tried to retweet it,
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.560]   then you didn't read it, which is it?
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.280]   Therefore you didn't read it.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.040]   Which isn't necessarily the case.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.200]   Right, because there's a lot of times I have read same stories somewhere else.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:41:01.600]   Let's say, for example, Canon's new R6 and R5 cameras are expected to be released in July of 2020.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.880]   I saw that on four different websites.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:05.120]   Right.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:05.920]   So.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.080]   But I'm going to retweet it from one possibly.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.080]   Right.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.640]   Right.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.120]   You know.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:09.760]   That's fair.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.760]   It could just be a backhanded slap at the again at the president because
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.360]   he keeps retweeting, you know, white surprises.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.000]   Oh, he doesn't.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:18.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.080]   I'm getting trouble with your listeners.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.200]   He doesn't read anything.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.160]   Oh, no.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.480]   So there is actually a defense for like, I didn't read it.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.000]   I didn't know.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.080]   I didn't know what that was all of it.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:36.080]   So his most recent one saying that the poor 75 year old Catholic protester who
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.480]   was slammed the body slam to the ground by the Buffalo police was secretly an Antifa
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.000]   agitator who was.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.120]   And then he fell more than he was pushed.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:45.520]   It did.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.360]   He fell harder than he was pushed.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.000]   That retweet.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:48.320]   That was a.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.240]   Interesting.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.600]   But he.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.560]   That was something he read.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.920]   It was something he saw way in.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.560]   And yeah.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.560]   I wouldn't know because I've been on social media hiatus.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.520]   So I could take.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.400]   Oh, you missed that one.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.200]   It was good.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.840]   He retweeted a story from the.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.320]   What is it?
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.600]   Official American network.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.080]   What is it?
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:06.880]   We had Stanford.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:07.760]   I don't even know what's going on.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.720]   Something that was actually a Russian guy.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.960]   The piece was the guy with a with a Russian accent saying this guy was clearly look.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.840]   You can see the fun.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.720]   He's scanning.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.680]   It turns out this guy is a correspondent for Sputnik,
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:24.400]   which is the Russian propaganda service.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.400]   Even the bit it.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.480]   It's like.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.120]   Oh my gosh.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.600]   So clearly, I mean, I don't know what's going on.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.720]   Maybe, but that's what I'm wondering.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.840]   Maybe Twitter is saying, hey, Donald, watch the story first.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.320]   But no, that they're not saying that.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.000]   No, they're not saying that because they do have the power to directly.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:42.400]   At.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.440]   Yeah, I could have said that.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.520]   Hey, Donnie.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:50.560]   Did I should mention real quick that actually.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.880]   I'm 95 Google.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.680]   No, somebody else debunked the new Pixelbook story.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.960]   So I'm disappointed to say that again.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.760]   From one box.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:42:59.920]   That's.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.600]   We're not saying.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.800]   Sorry, no evidence.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.360]   This is Rockman.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.760]   So everybody.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:12.000]   That doesn't mean they're not going to do it, Jeff.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.360]   No, it doesn't mean they're not going to do it, but just, you know, just from what I said,
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.720]   we look for any evidence we can.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.160]   We love to have it, but we can't say that there's really any evidence yet that there is.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.680]   Twitter is working, working to bring back verification.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.400]   Where did it go?
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.960]   Did it is there?
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.400]   They cut it out a while ago.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:31.440]   They did it, especially.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.080]   I worked with them.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:38.400]   That was not paid, but I at the request, I helped them get a bunch of COVID.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.800]   Scientists verified that was.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.080]   So they still do the blood off.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.120]   Check, but they don't have that process where anyone can apply.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.320]   Yes, they don't.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:46.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.440]   Yeah, it's been a while.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.000]   I've been trying and they're like, no, we're not doing it anymore.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:03.280]   Oh, well, if you go to school and you get your PhD in virology and you work on COVID,
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.720]   then maybe I can do something for you.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:08.160]   I completely see what we're talking about.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:08.880]   Two years.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:11.200]   Yeah, it's a talk of 15 years.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:17.280]   I think that that check in something like in a case like that, that's really important to say
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.680]   this personally does have this.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.240]   That's why they did it.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.040]   It was very happy.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:27.360]   And the scientists were amazingly grateful for getting it.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.600]   It was phenomenal to watch it.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:37.280]   Well, it turns out they paused this in 2017 after the Charlottesville Tiki torch rally
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.440]   when Heather Heyer was run down by a white supremacist.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:49.360]   The company gave a blue check to a white supremacist who tweeted disparaging remarks about Heather Heyer
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:56.960]   and gotten so much trouble for it that they suddenly maybe we better not do this anymore.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.520]   Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.560]   People unfortunately interpret it as an endorsement or an indicator of importance.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.120]   We recognize we have created this confusion.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.600]   We need to resolve it so we've paused verifications.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.560]   That was three years ago.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.600]   Yeah, and it has been a little while.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.080]   Well, I'm glad I have my blue check.
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:27.600]   By the way, Jack Dorsey is giving $3 million to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.800]   So yep, nice.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.680]   Hurt debt.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.000]   Nice.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.680]   Nice.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.320]   Not surprised either.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.040]   No.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.000]   No, Jack's been Jackson decent then.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.120]   Yeah, he is.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.240]   Yeah, he tries.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.800]   As I was going to say, he tries.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.240]   Wow, I'm waiting.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.560]   Nobody succeeds all the time, but he tries.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:53.760]   Wait down here at 119, whatever happened to 84 and 37.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.040]   Let's see.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.000]   Did you do to the rundown?
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.320]   It's all the way at the bottom now.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.360]   For those of you who can't figure out what's going on, it's just the spreadsheet.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.880]   It's the line numbers of these stories.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.880]   Every story has a line number.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.920]   True, never used.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.400]   Ant was the first person to ever use them.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.520]   Yeah, it'd actually be great.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.040]   It was a major innovation.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.800]   Every line number has a story.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.120]   Zoom.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.760]   Oh, I loved Steve Gibson yesterday.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:28.240]   He had done a whole security now on the white paper Zoom released by the prestigious
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.480]   cryptographers they had hired about how Zoom was going to do end-to-end encryption.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.960]   As in the key base people?
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.920]   Yeah, key base and Alex Stamos and a bunch of other people.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.800]   Okay.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:50.960]   But then Zoom's CEO said, well, free users aren't going to get end-to-end encryption.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.120]   Here we go.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:47:00.800]   But because we want the police to be able to see what they're doing.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:04.400]   Or pay, or you got to pay for it.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.440]   Period.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.840]   Yeah, and actually there is a legitimate point to that.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.080]   Alex Stamos said it's not as simple as that.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.080]   Yeah, Alex Stamos has lost all credibility with me.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:14.880]   Oh, come on.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.520]   Oh, he has.
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.400]   Oh, boy.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:23.200]   Listen to Steve's exegesis of the statement that Stamos, the tweets Stamos put out,
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.560]   and the statement that yesterday that Zoom put out, I hadn't read it.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.480]   As he's reading it, I'm saying Steve, those are mutually incompatible statements.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:38.720]   They're saying it's clear this is window dressing in BS.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.920]   That because the things that Zoom said they're going to do,
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.120]   they doesn't make any sense.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.320]   And Stamos' very lukewarm response on Twitter, if you read between the lines,
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.920]   said, hey, all we did is write the white paper.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.920]   It's up to Zoom to implement it.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.000]   He's not taking responsibility for the implementation.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.080]   Oh, he isn't.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:04.800]   Read it carefully.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.200]   He's not.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:05.600]   It's not.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.400]   Well, you know, all I can speak about is what we told.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.280]   He's also not an employee.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.640]   He's a consultant.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.440]   Consultant.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.400]   So it's very confusing.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:22.080]   You and told investors that encryption, he said, quote, this is a quote, free users.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.160]   For sure, we don't want to give them that because we also want to work together with
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.640]   FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.120]   Okay, fine.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.000]   Actually, I kind of understand that because if you're using it for free, they can't authenticate
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:38.160]   you.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.240]   They'd have no way of knowing who you are.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.720]   So, okay, maybe I understand that.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.800]   But the problem is that what they're trying to do with encryption and then encryption,
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.320]   even for paid users, it's pretty clear from their statement that Zoom does have the keys.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.800]   Zoom that it's end-to-end encrypted, but Zoom can unlock it.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.080]   Oh, so they could still see.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.920]   They could still give it.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:08.480]   So, in my opinion, this statement was to complete a complete attempt to,
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.960]   what is it magicians do, misdirect the press.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:18.400]   So that the press would go crazy about free users should get it too,
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.240]   instead of really noticing what the Zoom's doing, which is we can give anything to law
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.320]   enforcement because we have the keys.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.920]   Period.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:38.080]   Which means it's not, once again, it's not end-to-end encrypted.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.480]   And so, once again, they're misrepresenting what they're doing as they always have.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.080]   And this just kind of, this is, as Zoom has always acted.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.000]   So, to me, I was given a lot of credit because of the people they brought in,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.240]   but I think that was window dressing, honestly.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:58.400]   Zoom does not proactively monitor meeting content.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.200]   And we do not share information with law enforcement,
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:04.400]   acceptance, circumstances like, like child sex abuse.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.040]   Now, this is the incompatible statements.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.200]   We do not have back doors where participants can enter meetings without being visible to others.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.680]   Oh, no, okay, that's not an, none of this will change.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.840]   Zoom's end-to-end encryption plan balances the privacy of its users
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.600]   with the safety of vulnerable groups, including children and potential victims of hate crime.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.160]   We plan to provide end-to-end encryption to users for whom we can verify identity,
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.960]   thereby limiting harm to these vulnerable groups.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.120]   But wait, they just said they would share information with law enforcement
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.680]   in circumstances like child sex abuse.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.800]   So, which is it?
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.160]   Is it end-to-end encrypted?
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.080]   Or do they have the key?
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:42.800]   They're very clearly saying, we have the key.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.240]   And if we think it's merited, we'll share it.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.160]   Well, guess what makes it merited?
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:48.720]   A warrant.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.320]   Period.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:55.600]   Because if you have the key, law enforcement can say, let's see it.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.360]   Right, but they're arguing that it's being used by child-borne people
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.200]   and they tend to use quick accounts.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.840]   No, no, but they're saying, we'll provide end-to-end encryption,
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:11.680]   but then they're also saying, we will not share information with law enforcement
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.240]   except in circumstances like child sex abuse.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.800]   If they can share the information, it's not an end-to-end encryption.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.080]   They are mutually incompatible statements in one paragraph.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.040]   Right.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.400]   So, Steve was kind of like, okay.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:24.480]   Good catch.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:26.560]   Good catch.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.520]   Thank you, Steve.
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.480]   That's why we love him.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:34.800]   So, but again, honestly, most of the time you're using, by the way,
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.040]   Zoom also said in that statement, and nobody else does end an encryption either.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.800]   And it's true, this is for most conferences,
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:46.320]   like the conferences we use Zoom for sales calls and staff meetings,
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.120]   who cares if it's encrypted.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.640]   But on the other hand, if you're a physician or a psychiatrist using Zoom
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:01.120]   for confidential calls with your clients, maybe you should use something that is ended encrypted.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.640]   Not Zoom.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:07.840]   I would hope so anyway.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.920]   Well, I think it's very clear.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:18.160]   So, I agree with you about Alex's tweets, but I think if you read clearly,
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:21.920]   he's basically saying, look, we gave them the way to do it,
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.160]   but we're not taking any responsibility for if they do it.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:30.880]   ACLU suing Los Angeles over their controversial scooter tracking system.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.320]   Is there more to say about that?
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.040]   I don't know.
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.080]   That's just the story.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:36.400]   No.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.080]   I need more scooters here.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:47.840]   I mean, this is what's sad, is that Uber and other companies are just taking them and putting
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:48.880]   them in the scrap heap.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.880]   They're not reselling them or anything.
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:53.360]   They're just trashing them, which is a waste.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:53.920]   And bicycle.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.600]   You can't get a bike right now.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.160]   Right.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.360]   Yeah, you can't get one.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.320]   Just crushing them.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.240]   They don't want to be responsible because those bikes,
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:05.200]   I got to tell you having ridden rent a bikes and rent a scooter,
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.240]   they're in pretty bad shape.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.080]   They don't want to be responsible for any injuries incurred.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.360]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.680]   More CYA.
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:13.920]   All right.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.680]   Would you like to do a change log?
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.280]   Does that feel good right now?
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:19.360]   Because we got to wrap this up before we go.
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:19.760]   Yes.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.360]   How about a Google change log?
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.640]   The Google change log.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:29.760]   I got one for Mr. Ant Pruitt.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:35.200]   Google camera 7.4, which is the app, not out yet.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.360]   But it will be out soon.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.720]   Rolling out with 1080p 4K resolution quick toggles.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.440]   And oh darn it.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.160]   It looked like XTA developers was saying 8X zoom.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:54:00.480]   But now Android police is saying that is or isn't available.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.760]   I don't know, 8X zoom for videos on the Pixel 4X.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.520]   I would hope not.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.480]   That sounds awful.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.280]   I hate these high zoom.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.040]   Yeah, because it's not optical, right?
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.960]   No, it's ridiculous.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.920]   Two to two and a half tops.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.720]   That's not acceptable.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.360]   Okay.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.040]   That's the Ant limit.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:23.280]   Yeah, because it's so pixelated and grainy,
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.720]   the quality is just not usable.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.600]   Stop it about two, two and a half at the most.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:32.080]   I have my phone on the cheap charger.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:32.960]   Let's see.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.440]   And system update restart now.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.280]   Android R, here we go.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:38.960]   Oh, you went with the bay that that's right.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.440]   I don't know what kind of video resolution I'll have.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.640]   Anyway, it's unclear what you're going to get,
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.920]   but keep your eye out for Google camera version 7.4.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.360]   Apparently be rolling out soon.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.360]   Maybe today on the Play Store.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.600]   8X zoom for videos.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.360]   That seems like too much.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.840]   Visit video resolution quick toggles that I'd like.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.160]   Because it's kind of deep in the settings to change the video resolution.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.440]   So it'd be nice to have that.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.440]   Because most of the time I just wanted to do 1080p,
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:15.760]   but every once in a while I'd like to do 4K, right?
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.000]   It'd be nice to be able to quickly switch.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.240]   A little party going on over there.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.120]   It sounds like somebody's happy back there.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:25.680]   That's good.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:31.200]   She's just looking at her purple Jeep Wrangler and smiling.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.680]   Smiling.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.400]   Google search wants to make control F a thing in the past.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.480]   Man, I use that all the freaking time.
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.680]   Well, I got scared when I saw this.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:47.440]   I was going to have a jet fit, but they're just not going to eliminate it.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.880]   They're just going to say, "You're not going to want to use it anymore."
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:51.600]   You won't need to.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.200]   What you searched for will show up.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.520]   We'll be highlighted and see how it's bold.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:56.560]   See you headline writers.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.720]   It's bold and headline writers.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.240]   So it's still going to have control F so you can search within a page.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.080]   But more likely you'll just note that the term you searched for
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.360]   will be bold in the snippet if they're still allowed to do snippets.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.920]   If I don't say it hard or snippet still out there though.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.200]   What's the snippet status?
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.160]   Oh my god, yes.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.360]   We should forget the change log.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.520]   We should just have a weekly snippet status.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.480]   Snippet status.
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.320]   Say it three times fast.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.200]   No, but snippet.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.720]   YouTube makes video chapters official.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:34.160]   Oh, I'm so mad about this because it means now that everybody's going to be asking us to do it.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.480]   Aunt, would you...
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:38.720]   I don't want to because it's too much work.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:40.000]   Makes our editors how to work.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:40.880]   It's a lot of work.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.480]   Would you take advantage of this aunt?
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:43.840]   Negative.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.200]   It's nice for users because they can jump to the part of the thing that they want.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.960]   Well, I mean, the videos that I particularly create are 15 minutes or less.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.360]   In my opinion, I'm like, "There's no need for that."
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.360]   You come there for a particular lesson.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.280]   I'm giving you that lesson in a condensed format of 15 minutes or less.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.000]   You know who is using it, I think, is Alex Lindsey in his office hours.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.120]   So, you know, that he has these early morning calls.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.880]   He does with creators.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.160]   You've been in there.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:19.200]   Yes, sir.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.000]   In fact, I'm going to be on June 18th.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.760]   He's going to have me honest a guest.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.720]   But you see how when you go to the notes here, he's got the show notes,
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:29.760]   but next to it is a time.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.080]   And you can click it and jump right to that part of the call, which I
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.440]   is wonderful.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.440]   That's cool for something that's, you know, an hour long.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.760]   The problem is somebody's got to do it.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.400]   It ain't going to be me.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.320]   And I'm pretty sure Mr. Lindsey isn't doing it either.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.840]   No, no, he's not even said it's got some of this guy doesn't form.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.040]   So volunteer.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:59.200]   So if you add chapters to your video, you can actually, the way you do it is you do it via the
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:57:59.680]   description.
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:05.200]   You start a list of timestamps with zero colon, zero, zero, followed by a chapter title.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.480]   You do one on each line.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.800]   So you'd have to know where the timestamps are, but and that's what, as you can see,
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.440]   if you look here, that's what Alex has done or his, his helper has done.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:17.760]   So as he was writing out the notes, he just wrote out the times.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.280]   And what Google does automatically is make that a direct link into the video,
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.240]   which is cool.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:22.720]   That's cool.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:23.360]   Really cool.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:27.600]   Nice feature for those who have more time than I do.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:32.240]   Available on desktop Android and iOS right now.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.000]   Come on, you have time.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.760]   You just have to make less sourdough.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:41.200]   I had to give you all your time.
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.520]   I'm throwing away the sourdough now, I'm making brisket.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:51.120]   And you make brisket, I mean sourdough biscuits with your brisket.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:51.520]   Ooh.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.040]   And briskets and brisket.
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.160]   Actually, that's another thing I want to do.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:58.080]   And maybe I need a tutorial on that for you.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.840]   I want to make soft southern biscuits.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:03.200]   That's one thing I can't do.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:04.000]   You need the flour.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.520]   My biscuits are, I've never been able to get biscuits right.
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.080]   I've been clinkers.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:13.200]   Oh, they're either bricks or they're like blocks of clay.
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.080]   They're so brittle.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.760]   I can never get that.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:21.040]   They say you have to get that special flour that you can't even buy it on Amazon from here.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.840]   You have to go to Greenfield, South Carolina.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   You have to get it.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.720]   That's what they say.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.760]   Chop the wheat down.
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.680]   So it's separate the wheat from the chastel.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.480]   It's soft wheat.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:33.200]   It's got a stone watermelon.
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:33.840]   Stone ground.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:39.440]   YouTube has published an in-depth guide to monetization.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:46.640]   It's not as easy as people may have said.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:51.280]   No, understand more clearly the types of content advertisers may not wish to appear against.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.600]   Creators apparently often confused by why you can't put ads on some stuff.
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:04.880]   We get this occasionally from advertisers who say, we don't want,
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:09.120]   we got one from an advertiser who said, if you're going to talk about COVID-19,
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.400]   we don't want an ad on that show.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:13.440]   To which I said, screw you.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.880]   You're not telling me what to do in my show.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:23.840]   It's not like we're doing, here's a special treatment for COVID-19 or something.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:25.600]   We're not selling silver underwear.
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.720]   So I understand that they wouldn't want to be on a scammy thing.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:38.400]   Anyway, Google is talking about also hate content, but prank content
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:44.640]   and other things that you just won't be able to monetize.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.760]   And so it's good.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.600]   They should tell people, frankly, what not to do.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:50.480]   Don't you think, Jeff?
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:58.400]   On the other hand, as an editorial person, I don't want to be told by an advertiser what not to do.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:01.280]   And I don't feel like that's, although it's their right to say,
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.040]   I don't want my ads on that content.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.640]   So it's tricky.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:06.400]   It's tricky.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.960]   I'm glad Google's doing it transparently.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:17.920]   I love it that Google Maps and Apple Maps have both adapted to changes in DC street names,
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.520]   Black Lives Matter.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:21.680]   Plaza is quickly.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.320]   Quickly.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:22.720]   Quickly.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.360]   That's awesome.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:24.880]   It's really nice.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:30.400]   You saw they added onto that mural in yellow.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.000]   Defunds.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:32.480]   Defunds.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:32.880]   At least.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:33.600]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.760]   So I joked on Twitter today that Twitter was the new street and the street is the new Twitter.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.640]   You can just paint your big tweet on the street.
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:43.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:43.760]   Look at this.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.440]   This is so cool.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.080]   It's pretty amazing.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:49.760]   They actually, the satellite image shows it.
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.600]   Google has not updated it.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.760]   We checked this yesterday on Mac break weekly.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.000]   The top is Google Maps.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.760]   The bottom is Apple Maps.
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.920]   Apple Maps, I think they made an effort to get later satellite imagery because that was only painted
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.040]   recently.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.440]   Google did rename the street on the map.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.240]   You could see it says Black Lives Matter Plaza, but they haven't yet updated it.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:13.120]   It's cool.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:13.840]   Isn't that great?
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:14.560]   I think that's right.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:14.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:16.080]   It's so amazing.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:22.400]   I also, the mayor of DC says, you know, we're not going to take off the Defund police.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.280]   That's free speech.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.640]   Free speech.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:25.360]   What a concept.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.040]   What a concept.
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:28.000]   Imagine that.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:28.960]   Imagine that.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:31.600]   No, I want a regulator to decide what's there.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.680]   I don't think I ever said that, Jeff.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:37.760]   No, you didn't.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.960]   I'm just unblocking others.
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:39.360]   Others.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:39.840]   What?
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.000]   Google search and maps will soon display business hours for us old folks, Jeff.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.520]   Oh, good.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.880]   It's always six in the morning.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.120]   Why is it always freaking six in the morning?
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:51.440]   What are they?
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.640]   They have to get up over the bathroom.
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:54.160]   That's when you and I are up.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.080]   All those old folks are up early and I'm going to.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:02.320]   So you can now add to your Google, if you're a business and you should add this,
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:08.240]   pick up a delivery information, accessibility information as there's a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:13.520]   So you can now set store hours with for seniors.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:15.600]   I have a lot of stuff like that.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:18.320]   It really does help you out into search too, right?
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.280]   Absolutely.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.360]   I would bet because I'm going to search, you know, where can I get, you know,
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:26.880]   special senior discount at Applebee's?
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:29.280]   Google.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.080]   And I haven't had the chance to try this yet.
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.240]   Has now added noise cancellation to meet.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:41.280]   We should, we're going to do our, we're going to have our editorial meeting tomorrow.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.440]   I mean, sorry, right after the show, actually.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.520]   So, no, sorry, it didn't mean to say that right after the show.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.360]   So I'm going to make some tapping noises in the background.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.120]   I'm going to start vacuuming.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.840]   I'm going to get the dog to bark and we'll see if we can hear it.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.600]   Because suppose just like any other meeting.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:01.840]   So any other meeting, supposedly poor Google meet.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.880]   They are in third place.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:13.440]   Zoom, obviously in first place, just 30 times increasing usage between December and April.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.160]   But not a little.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:14.960]   30 times.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.920]   Meet has had 100 million daily meeting participants in the month of April.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.080]   But that's nothing compared to the 300 million Zoom has.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.080]   And Microsoft has claims 200 million on teams.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.400]   So, three, two, one.
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.400]   And that is the Google change log.
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:49.520]   Were you shocked that James Bennett resigned?
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:52.000]   In the end, Jeff?
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:52.560]   No.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.160]   He was kind of opinion.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:59.120]   Editor at the New York Times who claimed it's kind of hard to believe.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:02.720]   I'd never read that Tom Cotton editorial before I published it.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.720]   How could that be?
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:07.840]   Do you think he could read it?
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.600]   It could be Dow who's under him in charge of Bob Pedd.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.120]   He's left his job and is going somewhere in the newsroom now.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.320]   So maybe, you know, Dow's throwing people under the bus.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.480]   Dad said to Bennett, I read it.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:21.520]   You don't have to read it.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.880]   Just put it in the paper.
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:27.280]   It's good with a really inflammatory headline over the inflammatory text.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:28.080]   Yeah, good idea.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:28.560]   Good idea.
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:33.680]   Alexis O'Hanean, from Reddit says,
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.280]   "You could fill my board seat with a black candidate."
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.480]   Reddit says, "Okay, deal.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.880]   He also pledges a million dollars to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp."
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.800]   Okay, I didn't know when this happened.
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:45.520]   I didn't know about that.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:49.040]   A couple of days ago, I think they just replaced him today.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.240]   Oh, did they replace him?
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:52.080]   Yeah, they were raised with a founder of
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:54.800]   Michael Sebel.
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:55.440]   Thank you.
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.880]   He's CEO of Y Combinator and just TV.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.440]   Well, he also was the founder of Justin TV.
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:03.120]   Yeah, I probably know the guy.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:04.960]   That's awesome.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:05.600]   Good for you.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.440]   Sebel's actually a perfect person to put in that seat.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:12.160]   And Alexis is busy.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.120]   He doesn't need that.
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:16.400]   No, Alexis is doing fine.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:16.960]   Doing fine.
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.000]   Doing fine.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.320]   But I think that's really, I mean, I think that's
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.920]   more than lip service that's saying--
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.160]   It is.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.120]   I was trying to think of what I could--
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.000]   That's awesome.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.640]   We need better representation on the board of Reddit.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:29.840]   And I think that's really important.
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:33.680]   As many folks in my community have said,
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.280]   over the last few years, we just want to seat at the table.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.320]   Absolutely.
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:40.800]   You want to be in the room where it happens?
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.600]   Yeah, and that's pretty damn awesome.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:43.920]   Yay.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.280]   Yay.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:50.960]   And I'm so pleased that Netflix
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:55.760]   won in its copyright battle against the United States military,
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:00.560]   because they copyrighted the term "Space Force First."
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:05.440]   Air Force says, "You can't call that show Space Force."
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.400]   Actually, they're not worried about that.
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.680]   It's the T-shirts.
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:09.760]   They don't want them to sell T-shirts.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.600]   But the--
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.200]   Have you watched the show?
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:14.240]   Yeah, I watched the whole thing.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.440]   I actually liked it everybody.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:16.640]   It got the worst reviews ever.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:18.960]   I want former TV guy, critic Jeff Tarvis.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:19.600]   Yeah, I will.
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:21.280]   I'm not going to watch it.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:21.920]   I haven't--
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:23.920]   I haven't cued, but I haven't watched it yet.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:24.400]   You know what?
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.480]   People were hoping it would be another VEEP,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:28.960]   you know, that it would be biting satire,
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:33.120]   because the whole premise is an unnamed president has created
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:37.920]   a branch of the Air Force called Space Force.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:41.120]   And he says, "We're going to have Boots on the Moon by 2026."
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:45.920]   And Steve Carell is the four-star general put in charge.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:50.720]   And it could have been like VEEP where it's biting satire.
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:55.040]   Which I still watch to this day on my Plex server.
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.960]   VEEP is the most amazing show ever.
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.720]   John Malkovich plays the chief scientist in there.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:01.840]   He's fabulous in it.
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.840]   But--
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.600]   He's got the scientist voice too.
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:06.000]   It's perfect.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.520]   As one reviewer said, he's perfectly loo-sh.
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:16.320]   But they didn't go for the biting comedy,
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.400]   they didn't go for the satire.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.400]   They went for the--
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:21.840]   Just kind of like, "Oh, it's nice."
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:23.680]   And you kind of--
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:28.400]   You feel Steve Carell turns out to be a really nice
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.840]   guy with lots of principles.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:32.960]   It just doesn't have the edge to it.
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.080]   I enjoyed it.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.840]   I laughed out loud a few times.
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.200]   I'll watch it.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.440]   I look forward to watching it.
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:40.640]   My favorite part,
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:41.920]   or one of my favorite parts,
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.440]   at least appropriate to this audience,
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:50.000]   is the social media expert who's played by Ben Schwartz.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.240]   It's very funny.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.280]   And funny.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:54.240]   And his name--
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:55.040]   Swartz's in this too.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:55.520]   Yeah.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.400]   And his name--
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:01.280]   I can't even say on the show because it's an Italian name,
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.480]   but they make it sound really--
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:04.720]   Every time they say his name, it sounds obscene.
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:05.760]   And it's--
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:07.200]   It's not John Raphael.
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:07.760]   No.
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:10.240]   It's very funny, I have to say.
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.040]   And he is the worst social media guy ever.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.280]   He is exactly what you'd expect.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.120]   It's hysterical.
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.720]   I thought it was funny.
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.440]   It wasn't what it could have been,
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.480]   which is a biting political satire.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:28.240]   How many feeps are there in the world after all?
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.880]   Let us do our picks.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.840]   Do you have a thing?
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:36.640]   You have several things, Mr. Antbrood.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.400]   Just two.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:39.040]   Just two.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.840]   I have one in particular for the Twitter audience.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.160]   Someone recommended this to me
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:49.680]   years ago, and I still use this service.
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.760]   And it's called "Wendr Stat."
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:52.960]   I can't remember her name.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.200]   I'm sorry I don't remember your name at this moment,
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.360]   but you recommended it to me on Twitter.
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:00.480]   And man, this thing really does save my bacon from time to time.
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.200]   It allows me to go in and see what's chewing up all of my disk space.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.680]   And it usually ends up being some temp folder that I don't need anymore.
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.320]   And it does a great job of allowing you to go in and just pick out exactly where the problem is.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:19.200]   It just puts it in this big old colorful chart.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:25.840]   So it makes it easy to find and not having to let Microsoft try to find it for you so much faster.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:28.880]   And for people like you, Linux nerds,
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:31.920]   there is a Linux version available called "Cater Stat."
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:34.560]   And I believe there's also an OSX version too.
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.120]   Yes.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.880]   Disc inventory X, which I've used.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.480]   I've recommended all three for years.
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:40.560]   It's often the case.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:42.880]   Windows is the worst at this where you have just...
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:45.360]   You can't figure out where the hell my drive go.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.720]   Yeah, it just disappeared.
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:46.880]   Yeah.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.680]   I used it yesterday and saved 20 gigs.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:49.920]   Yeah.
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.840]   Those big blobs.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.120]   Like really 20 gigs.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.400]   Yeah, no, it's amazing.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:55.280]   Right?
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.360]   We used to think a two gig hard drive was huge.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.680]   Oh, gosh, man.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.240]   Yeah, I like that and it's free.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:04.880]   Oh, another reason Jeff, you should watch Space Force and Forgot.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:07.040]   Jin Yang's on it.
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.120]   Oh, right with long.
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.840]   He is really good in it.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:15.760]   He's hysterical in it with that same dry humor that he has.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.280]   Have you watched his stand up?
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.400]   Have you watched his stand up?
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.480]   He's got a stand up special on Netflix too.
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.440]   Oh, I watched it.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:21.920]   Yeah.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.880]   Because he's very, very deadpan, hysterical.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:25.440]   Right.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:27.680]   Just as good as he was in Silicon Valley.
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.160]   And they actually give him a much media role.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:31.360]   Oh, nice.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:32.800]   Oh, good for him.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.320]   So, winderstat.net.
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:35.200]   I agree.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:35.760]   And it's free.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.600]   It's free.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.720]   Free, free, free.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:41.440]   Do you want to do the Curtis Jackson too?
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.240]   Yep.
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.080]   My other one is a book called Hustle, Harder Hustle,
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.080]   Smarter by Curtis Jackson.
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:48.560]   Hey, K.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.200]   Also, y'all.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:50.960]   It's 50 cent.
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:53.280]   50 cent as we wait folks call him.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:00.480]   I just got this book on Audible last week or so.
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:03.920]   And I haven't started it yet,
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:05.360]   but I wanted to recommend it in a way
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:07.280]   because I know a bit of his story.
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.880]   And between him and Ice Cube,
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:13.760]   when you think about where they came from
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.720]   and the very beginning as far as their humble living
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.440]   and the things that they dealt with on the day-to-day lifestyle,
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:22.880]   with the violence and stuff like that,
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:25.120]   then getting into the music industry
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.720]   and just grassroots and blowing up
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:31.440]   and just getting all of this fame and fortune
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:35.040]   and then being able to pivot even more from the music industry
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.840]   to get into Hollywood, if you will.
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.480]   Ice Cube has done an amazing job
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:43.840]   with writing his own movies and things of that nature.
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.360]   50 cent is the same way.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.320]   He's done a lot outside of the music industry
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.400]   and continues to just keep growing.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.760]   And just as he says, hustling, harder and smarter.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.840]   And he deserves a credit.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:00.400]   Now, granted, he is one of the best trolls out there on the internet.
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.320]   He's a good troll in people.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.200]   You know, if people want to learn how to troll,
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.200]   follow 50 cent because he does a good job.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:08.560]   I admire him because--
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:09.520]   All right, Tom.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:11.360]   You see, so many guys make it big
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.280]   in the music industry, make millions of dollars
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.960]   and then not handle it.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.120]   And so I do admire that.
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.120]   And Fitti narrates it if you get the audiobook.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.080]   Yeah, I said I had to go ahead and get that
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.480]   because I know his story and just,
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.440]   you know, selling music out of the trunk of a car
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:33.520]   and stuff like that and look at him now, you know, this is crazy.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:34.640]   That's nice.
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:35.280]   That's awesome.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.800]   Mr. J. J. Jarvis.
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:40.000]   That's--
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.400]   Oh, let's see here.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.400]   I already gave up one of them.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:51.040]   I think the other one that I would do is national TV advertising
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:54.720]   fell by 26 percent in April year over year.
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:56.640]   Now, we expect that somewhat temporary.
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.120]   But some of that money that flies away
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.640]   and doesn't need to be on TV is going to learn
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.400]   that need to be on TV and then it's going to come back.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:06.560]   So newspaper advertising is way down,
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.000]   magazine advertising is way down, TV advertising is down.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000]   Podcast advertising.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:12.560]   Podcast advertising.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.840]   It is?
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:14.240]   Way down.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.000]   I keep thinking though that it's just a matter of time before,
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.080]   and I still believe this will happen.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:24.720]   We take a chunk of that--
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:26.480]   Yep.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.480]   General media buy because we work so much better
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.520]   than the general media.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:32.560]   Absolutely.
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:34.160]   They're just going to learn the ways.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.080]   They're going to learn while they've been wasting their money.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.240]   Someday that day will come.
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:41.760]   Actually, our advertisers know it.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.000]   But, you know--
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:44.800]   You do other--
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.280]   I would have--
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:47.680]   We need general motors, general mills,
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:49.120]   all the generals we need.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.200]   I just saw two new advertisers come by at an email,
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:52.160]   so that's good news.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:52.560]   That's good news.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:52.800]   Oh.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:54.800]   Yeah, I haven't seen that.
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:55.200]   One.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.880]   One new advertiser, one giving away nice things.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.240]   At the front desk, I'm still looking.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.040]   Oh, yes.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:02.480]   Yes.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:05.280]   Yeah, there is a call tomorrow with one new one.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:05.680]   Yes.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.400]   Is there?
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:06.720]   Okay.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.920]   I'll be setting up my trigger grill right at that time.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:11.520]   Yeah, you might want to check email, sir.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.000]   I don't--
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.520]   Everybody knows.
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.480]   I don't read--
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:15.840]   I don't read my email.
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.320]   I don't want--
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.480]   I don't read no email.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.760]   I don't read no stinking email.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.200]   I didn't do any pick or anything.
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:23.840]   I was lazy.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:24.400]   That's fine.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.520]   It's like something.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:26.240]   It's late.
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:26.560]   I know.
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:27.600]   There were a lot of--
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:30.720]   It's so damn wonderful to have you.
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:32.240]   We got to get him back on the show.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:34.160]   Yeah, nice pleasure.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:37.760]   The reason I felt like I put in a bad situation,
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.800]   because to sit in between Jeff and Stacy,
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:42.160]   as they shoot at each other--
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.760]   I--
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.560]   Someone is--
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.840]   Is the best seat in the house.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.560]   It's a good seat.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.760]   But anytime you want to come--
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.280]   Well, the one that's really happening is--
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.880]   Stacy and I are fine.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.720]   It's Leo is trying to--
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.080]   Go-dus.
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:56.960]   Go-dus.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:57.440]   Go-dus.
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.480]   I love watching it.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:15:59.760]   I'm go-dun-ya.
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:02.400]   Definitely one of my favorites of the week, definitely.
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.440]   I should probably mention--
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.960]   I hate to do this again,
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.880]   because I picked it already on Mac Break Weekly,
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.640]   but it's such a good deal.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.240]   And there's only a few days left.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.880]   If you like games, itch.io is an indie game site, itchio.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.520]   And they have an amazing bundle.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.240]   And really, it's as much a story as anything else.
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:22.560]   The bundle keeps getting bigger,
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:24.880]   independent creators keep giving their game,
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:27.680]   putting in games that are now in this bundle.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:34.560]   1,509 independent games for $5.
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:37.600]   Many of them cost more than $5 by themselves.
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:42.800]   They've got 1,198 creators putting in for this.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.080]   It's--
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:45.840]   It reminds me of Humble Bundle, dude.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:46.880]   It's like a Humble Bundle.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:47.280]   It's good at it.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:49.840]   But it's the biggest bundle I've ever seen.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:50.480]   Wow.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:52.560]   And it's raised more money than I've ever seen.
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:52.720]   It's--
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.440]   Oh, crap.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:54.480]   $4 million?
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:55.360]   Yes.
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:58.080]   They call it the bundle for racial justice and equality.
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:00.720]   And this is, again, this is the kind of thing that gives me hope.
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:04.240]   The proceeds will be split 50/50 with the NAACP Legal Defense
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:07.680]   and Educational Fund and the Community Bail Fund,
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:10.320]   which divvies out its money to community bail funds
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:11.200]   all over the country.
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.720]   So they were shooting for $5 million,
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:17.200]   it's five days as we record five days left.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:19.680]   They have already--
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:23.200]   they have 398,000 sales.
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.640]   The average sale is not $5 but $10,
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:27.600]   because when you buy your--
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.960]   you can give more.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.920]   The top contribution, somebody threw in five grand.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.120]   Wow.
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:39.200]   They have raised $4.3 million for racial justice and equality.
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.520]   And so there really are a number of stories here.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:44.800]   A, wow, 1,500 games for $5.
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:48.400]   B, wow, $4.3 million.
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:51.520]   C, all of this for racial justice and equality.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.400]   And it gives me hope that we--
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.960]   maybe this isn't 1968 all over again.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.440]   Maybe--
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:57.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:58.800]   --I'm not going to do something.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.160]   That's awesome.
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:00.640]   Is that great?
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.600]   Thanks to games.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.320]   That's worth--
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.480]   That's worth repeating, sir.
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:04.880]   Yeah.
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:06.000]   I guess so.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.920]   And what's interesting--
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:10.400]   and games get a bad rap--
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:13.520]   but invariably, when gamers on Twitch,
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.320]   or the bundles try to raise money for great causes,
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.320]   they raise millions.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:20.800]   Children.
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.200]   And I see that on YouTube too.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.560]   And it's never knock a gamer,
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.640]   because gamers are some of the most generous people
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:29.840]   I've ever seen.
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.280]   And here's a perfect example.
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:32.240]   It's really great.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:32.640]   Yeah.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:37.200]   So I-T-C-H dot I-O-H-E-O.
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.840]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.120]   Thank you, and for being here.
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:41.920]   We'll get you back.
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.360]   I think maybe we have to--
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:45.920]   I used to have a seat right here.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:46.640]   We can't do that.
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.640]   We can't socially distance now, you know.
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:48.800]   Yeah.
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:50.400]   We'll figure out a way to get you back in.
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:52.000]   I know much of you still better
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.600]   sitting in my own desk chair
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.040]   instead of sitting at that desk with a--
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:58.000]   Yeah, maybe that's not such a dangerous spot
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.120]   as sitting here was.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.520]   We want to encourage you to watch
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.840]   "Ance" shows, hands-on photography,
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:04.960]   hands-on wellness.
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.520]   They are on the Twitch network.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.440]   And I don't know what days they come out.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:13.920]   "HOP" hands-on photography is every Thursday.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.800]   And "How" hands-on wellness is every Friday.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:17.520]   Don't be insulted.
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.360]   I don't know what days my shows come out either.
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:22.560]   So that's just my general fogginess.
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:24.720]   Thank you, Aunt Pruitt.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:26.000]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.400]   Jeff is the director of the Town
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:30.960]   Night Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark.
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:32.480]   Graduate School of Journalism
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:34.400]   at the City University of New York.
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.200]   It's Craig in there.
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:37.680]   Has Craig said anything about me?
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:39.280]   Nothing.
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.800]   Shouting his name, anything?
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.280]   Hi, Craig.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:42.800]   Hi, Craig.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:44.640]   We love you, Jeff.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:45.600]   We have Craig on.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.480]   We'll get Craig on.
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:48.160]   We'll get Craig on someday.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.120]   But I'm just glad we got you guys on.
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:51.840]   You guys are great.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:52.160]   Stay tuned.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:52.240]   Stay tuned.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.120]   We'll be back next week.
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.840]   And I will be back someday.
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:58.320]   Thank you for being here.
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:19:59.760]   We do "Twig" every Wednesday.
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:00.800]   No, I'll be back next week.
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.320]   I don't want to start any more rumors.
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:03.440]   And yes, we pay Aunt.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:04.880]   Yes, we do.
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:07.120]   Yes, they do.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:07.840]   We do "Twig"
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:09.760]   I think you could negotiate a better deal now, Aunt.
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:10.400]   Yeah, maybe.
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:11.200]   Oh boy.
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:12.880]   We'll have rage.
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:15.520]   Guilt.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.920]   There's nothing like guilt to really bring out the dollars.
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.160]   We do this show every year.
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:20.640]   Fear of PR.
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.600]   Fear of PR.
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:25.200]   Every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:28.720]   Come by, say how you can watch the live streams at twit.tv/live.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:31.280]   And there's audio and video there.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:34.720]   If you're watching live, you should chat irc.twit.tv.
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:37.360]   And of course, there's on-demand versions of the show.
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:40.240]   That's why we call it a podcast.
[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:46.880]   Just go to twit.tv/twig and download it, or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.400]   You'll get it automatically.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.400]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.720]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:53.120]   Bye-bye.
