[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.840]   assignment joining us from his garden. Kevin Marks. It's great to have you. I've had my seat.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.640]   Tamovision.tv and salesforce.com. Man has been everywhere including Google. It's worked for
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.600]   everybody. Apple, Google, British Telecom. Nice to have you, Kevin. Gina, Japan is also here
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.480]   from Snutterware.org. Where are you, Gina? Are you in Brooklyn? I am in Brooklyn today. I'm on
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.400]   the road for business. I got on a plane right after all about Android last night. So, Chad was
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.000]   confused. You look like you're in Brooklyn. It just, it's just green walls here. Yeah, it just feels
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   like crown heights or something. I don't know why. I just, I just had that feeling. Something like
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.240]   that. Something like that. Anyway, great to have you both as we went to press, so to speak. I don't
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.760]   know how podcasts go to press. As we rolled tape, well, that's even more inachronistic.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   Google released a new product right on, right on our watch. Thank you, Google, for doing it before
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   not after the show. Yes. Shut downs after launches before. Exactly. Yeah, that's right. They shut
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   down reader right after the show, didn't they? And Nandy Rubin moved on right after that.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.720]   We'll talk about both. Well, we talked about both. We talked about both. Yeah, last week. Yeah.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.960]   Google Keep. It's now in the Android store. This is something that we had seen some rumors about a
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.360]   couple of days, maybe yesterday, because it would accidentally appeared on your Google Drive.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.440]   If you go to Google, the play, you can download it for Android, but you can also go to your drive,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   drive.google.com/keep. It is kind of an Evernote clone killer. I don't know. Look at that. Chad is
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.200]   a pasted in some settings for webcam settings. You could type. It doesn't look like there's a whole
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   lot of types, different data types on the desktop, but on the Android store, you can take pictures,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.000]   you can record audio, and of course, you can type text. It is very Evernote-y.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.440]   It is very Evernote, although it has the class of Google, it has the Google Now card design,
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   their cards, and you can actually move the cards around. So right now, if you're looking at it right
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840]   now, things are slow. I've just gotten an account and an error, a page reload. I think this is just
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.000]   the launch rush that's going on right now. Everybody's getting keep.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   Yeah, everybody's trying out keep right now, but it looks like there are checklists. You can upload
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.280]   images. You can do just straight up notes. And it syncs very quickly. Yeah. So I took a picture on my
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.160]   phone about a minute later. It showed up on my desktop, vice versa. Kevin pointed out, it kind of
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.560]   looks like Pinterest. At least one of the layouts, there's a couple, there's a list layout.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.680]   This is the phone, yeah. Yeah. If you do it on the phone, it tiles them up.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.360]   Yeah, tile layout as well. That's just modern web design. Everything's tiles nowadays.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.000]   Keep is kept. Look at that. So should if you're Phil Lyman and the Evernote crew,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.320]   should you be worried? Evernote's been at this a really long time.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.240]   Looks like it's not very good at rendering SVG. You try to upload SVG, some vector graphics.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.320]   Yeah. Well, this is this is. If it's HTML5, that would work, right?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.720]   Well, it should work. Yeah. The browser is they should just embed it. But
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.120]   so this was so this is I was going to do this as a number, but I was sitting out. I realized
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.480]   that there are more browsers now support SVG than support flash. Wow. That's huge.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.320]   SVG support is up to 83% according to can I use.com. Whereas flat if I flash is harder to work out,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   but I added up the browser percentages using the same browser that they have there of browser
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.360]   that could actually support flash. And that was under 80% because the newer androids, the iOS is
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.040]   and the latest Safari ships without it turned on by the four.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.480]   And now we know why Kevin Lynch left Adobe the man who was responsible for keeping flash alive
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   at Adobe for so long and went to Apple the number one flash killer.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.080]   That's not really fair. I think that one of the things that Lynch has done at Adobe is redirect
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   them to not creating runtimes themselves, but to use HTML. If you saw their product launch last
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   year, their entire tool chain now is is devoted to generating HTML and SVG and CSS and all this
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   stuff. But how much of that is because of Apple making the Google? Oh, it's because of Apple.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.120]   But the other thing is that they've also moved to contributing to WebKit and to Firefox,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   and bringing lots of all the rendering engine stuff into the browser core as opposed to being
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.240]   in their magic runtime that's stuck on the side. So Adobe saw the light. And presumably Lynch
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   was the guy who implemented. He's as CTO at Adobe. Lynch was the guy speaking and saying HTML 5
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.000]   is the future. I'm not mentioning flash at all at that time. Interesting. Interesting.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.080]   Went to in December. So it makes sense for Apple to hire Lynch because what are they going to have
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.320]   them do? Ah, that's a different question. I'm not sure. I'm assuming, you know, what that
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   they want, they want to understand the cloud based stuff. The other thing that he's done is do a big
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.440]   redirection of Adobe such that a lot of their app stuff is cloud based now.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.040]   That was the other part of the, you know, the people who get the cloud big time. Yeah, because
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.520]   they don't. They don't. iCloud is horrible. So goog back to Google key. I just, that was a little
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.640]   side note because it actually, it's interesting because they in made that announcement right after
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.560]   Mac break weekly yesterday was one of those. So we haven't had a chance to talk about it. But
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.240]   thank you, Kevin, because you're kind of up on this stuff. You knew the answer to that. So that's
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.440]   good. Thank you. Google keep, they do say it will show up in your Google drive later this week or next.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.840]   Your keep notes will show up and drive. Yeah, I think somebody said that in the chat room that
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.080]   that I don't know if it's a drive hero. Yeah. Yeah. So it is a drive you a row. I mean,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.400]   it's got to be dry. Yeah. There's a real time API. Yeah. Will there be like a file on your drive
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   called keep? It seems like the right there'll probably be a folder or something. Right. This
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:07.360]   appears to be a drive app. Yeah, says there is a widget for a keep for your phone. It says drag
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.280]   your notes around. You can choose the color for each note. Pro tip for adding thoughts quickly.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.760]   Without unlocking your device, there's a lock screen widget if you're running 4.2 or higher.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   So you can keep stuff without unlocking. So you walk down the street, you get an idea,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.760]   you get an idea, you just know to self and talk to yourself. I have to say it as an I'm an ever
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.640]   note evangelist. I love ever note use it for years. This could easily replace ever note for me.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.680]   Oh, you know what's missing? I know it's missing encryption.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.400]   There's no way to keep anything private on this. It's all, you know,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.880]   and there's no sharing. So there's no. No sharing. There's no sharing. And also,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.000]   the thing I use never know the most is is clip to ever note is saving web pages to have now.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Presumably I would like to see a Chrome extension for this and presumably that would have that
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.880]   capability. Yeah, it seems like that. This seems pretty inevitable, doesn't it? Yeah.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.680]   In fact, so does encryption and everything else. You know, this has got to scare ever note. I mean,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.560]   whether it's going to be an ever note replacement or not. Google's whenever it's like the old days
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.480]   when Microsoft said we're going to do something, everybody went, oh boy, that's just get out of that
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.560]   space quick. Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, look at reader, right? I mean, reader kind of leveled the
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.080]   the RSS client market there for a while. It was great. It was, you know, came out of Google. I mean,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   part of me is like, everyone who's been doing this for a long time, ever knows a great product,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.960]   ever known is really far into building kind of specific apps for specific purposes on top of
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.080]   ever notes. They've got like that food app and that, you know, personal CRM app that kind of stores
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   in ever notes. And this is kind of what Google's doing here, right? Keep is kind of like a,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.480]   it's a drive app, essentially, a drive app built on top of drive. But I don't know,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.600]   ever notes been added for a long time and it's a great product and it's seen a lot of success.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.560]   I'm not sure if they have to worry about this yet. What's strange about keep? I mean, for a company
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   that's so, that's working so hard to be focused and shutting down a lot of apps getting close to
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   the bone with Google with a reader. I mean, it's interesting that they're launching something
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.120]   like this, especially something like this that's slightly redundant. Like the checklist in Google
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.880]   Keep look a lot like Gmail tasks, which is one of these lesser used lesser known features of Gmail,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.800]   which has really not gotten a whole lot of attention since it's been, since it's launched. I mean,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.360]   I've been waiting for a really good Google task manager for a long time and it seems like they're
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.520]   kind of pecking at these, you know, kind of productivity apps, but didn't quite get there with this
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.360]   do list, although these checklist here and keep look really, really nice.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.640]   What do you think the killing of the so very public killing of Google Reader,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.200]   does that make people a little shaky about putting stuff into a new Google tool?
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   Does that hurt keep a little bit because?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.720]   It's among the nerds. I think so.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.840]   I don't think it's just nerds. I think the the the killing of Google Reader
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.560]   had a more widespread effect, ripple effect. You think that that people beyond nerds were
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.320]   like religiously using a news reader? No, not that they were using it, but they were aware of the
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:13.920]   fact that there was a howl of pain when 100,000 voices were suddenly stilled. It's hard not to
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.800]   feel that disruption in the force, even if you don't use it. Luckily, you know, RSS is a standard
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.840]   and oh, what was that? You just take a picture of a jeaner. How did you get that picture of jeaner?
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.560]   You just take a picture of your screen.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.160]   He's not hearing us now all of a sudden.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.480]   I'm sorry. You just dropped out for a sec.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.960]   Oh, okay. We're back. How did you do that? What did you do?
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.080]   That's that's my lock screen widget.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.040]   Oh, you got the lock screen widget. Oh, nice.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.400]   That's why you use an X is for so that you can use these things.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.080]   Um, Texas, whatever the other thing is, Galaxy. This is the one from, what's it?
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.440]   Look at that.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.400]   So that's, you know, how to add widgets on here.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:03.920]   Andrew, it is so weird. You got to go into the application drawer and then tap the widget tab.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.040]   Uh huh.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.280]   And then you got your widgets and then you drag them into the screen.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.200]   But the month of the lock screen though.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   Oh, the last thing. So you lock it and then you slide all the way right.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   Oh, all the right. There's that plus sign. Yes.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.640]   And a plus sign. Yeah.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.320]   I do a show about Android.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.120]   Yeah. Well, that just tells you that just shows you.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.200]   Not the world's most obvious UI.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.720]   There's some complexity here.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.320]   Uh, yes.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.720]   There's this new thing, this new sliding UI.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   Everybody's doing it. I just got the new Blackberry phone and there are no buttons.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   There are no menus. You just slide.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.440]   And Windows eight is all about sliding, swiping in for who was it came up with?
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.960]   Swipe in from the edge.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.080]   And why is it ubiquitous all of a sudden? I don't like it.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.280]   I don't like it one bit.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.360]   I think it's one of the few kind of gestures that are that's easy to detect
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.520]   on a touchscreen on a small touch stream device.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   I just think they're like the hardware determinant.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.720]   The number of gestures that are universal that you can detect.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.400]   Right. So the hardware determinant.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.280]   Warren Brickter invented it.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   Did you see that Wall Street Journal piece on Lauren? That was cool.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.680]   I didn't see that bit. I didn't see it.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.560]   Oh my god.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.960]   They called him a user interface God.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.400]   Because of pulled or fresh or I mean, he's done lots of good.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yeah. Jessica Lesson writing in the journal a couple of days ago.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.280]   Yeah. Let me see if I could find the article here.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.960]   Because yeah, it was a huge pain pain.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.280]   How do you pronounce that, Mr. Feasis pain? P-A-E-N to Lauren Brickter.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.720]   High priest of app design.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.400]   Yeah. High priest. That's what they call him.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.080]   Oh.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.440]   He'd Lauren is the guy he worked at Apple.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.280]   Then did Tweety, which is absolutely amazing.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.440]   Right. Which Twitter purchased and destroyed.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.920]   So Lauren went on to do a word game.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.440]   But apparently people call him all the time now.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   Oh yeah. He's not going to have any trouble getting a job any time.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.040]   Yeah. No. And he's a consultant.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.320]   You know, people go, "Oh, Lauren."
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.080]   But he invented these pull down to refresh.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.720]   Pulled or fresh.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   Uh-huh.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.720]   The swipe in and out.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   In fact, they talk about all the little things he popularized.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.640]   Twitter patent that pulled refresh.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.080]   Or did he patent the pull down to refresh?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.000]   Ah. Well, that's an interesting thing.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.680]   So he's at Twitter now.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.240]   I think. Or did he leave?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   But Twitter did patent it.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.600]   But then they always, when they say, they do their patents, they say,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.440]   but the person who invented it has the right to tell us
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.360]   not to use it offensively or something like that.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.720]   Oh, they're right. They have the IPA.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.240]   Not the India Paylal, but the Inventors patent agreement.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.720]   Right.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   Mr. Brickter filed a patent, the pull down to refresh feature,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.680]   before joining Twitter.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.180]   Oh.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.240]   The patent expected to be issued soon is now owned by Twitter.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.280]   Oh, it is owned, OK.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.440]   Um, but he says there are ways to build this feature
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.680]   using open source software, and he is long giving anyone
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.000]   his permission to use it as long as they aren't a--
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   Some word that begins with Dick.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.760]   I mean, Dee.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.480]   Some word that Wil Wheaton uses a lot.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.120]   Right. Twitter lets the Inventors of his patents.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.880]   Bido using them in offensive lawsuits.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   Is this the new version of Fran, does it?
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.400]   OK.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.280]   Fran.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.560]   Fair reason for not a dick.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.120]   Not a dick.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.960]   Fair reason for not a dick.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.840]   That's what Fran stands for, isn't it?
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.320]   That's Fran ad.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.920]   It's another kind of Fran.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.040]   So yeah, this is a good article for anybody interested in UI.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.760]   He really created a lot, but he did not
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.640]   create the swipe in from Edge.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.560]   Or maybe he did, I don't know.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.200]   So there it is.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.480]   Keep.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.760]   You know what?
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.240]   As long as we're doing that, let's take a break
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.440]   and come back and do the change log,
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.760]   because there's more changes to your Google.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   Lots of new features.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.880]   And Gina Trepani will have our change log
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   in just a moment.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.720]   But first, a word from Citrix, the creators
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.000]   of a brand new product called Podio.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.240]   P-O-D-I-O, as you know.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.920]   One of the biggest problems we face today
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.800]   is information overload.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.320]   We've got-- if you're working in business,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.280]   you've got projects, you've got teams,
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.760]   you've got data all over the place.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.800]   It's in your email.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.240]   It's in spreadsheets.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   It's in documents.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's disorganized, impossible to manage.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.360]   And priorities changing.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.080]   It's hard to kind of keep track of those.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.160]   Podio does all of that in more.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.240]   It lets you work the way you want to.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.840]   It's a way to escape email overload.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   But you still use your email.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.720]   You still use your Google Docs.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   You still use everything you've been using.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.760]   But it combines you to one stream.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.960]   You can completely customize your workspaces
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.200]   to manage your products.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.160]   Bring your team together.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.200]   Co-workers, clients, external contacts, whoever you want.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   And you can work with the mobile apps, too, which
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.720]   are really great on iPhone and Android.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.920]   It's great for CRM.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.080]   It's great for projects.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.240]   There's a Podio app builder.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.400]   So you can build your own apps.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.320]   But there's also a massive app store
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.960]   filled with wonderful free apps that you can add
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.280]   for every possible project.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.200]   Combine all of your information, all of your team,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.520]   into one easy to use workspace.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.400]   And you know what's great?
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.920]   It's free.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.840]   Go right now to podio.com.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.080]   Free.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.320]   But I ask you, when you go there and sign up
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.640]   to create a workspace, attach your Facebook, your Google,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.600]   your LinkedIn, whatever you're using, add a workspace,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.560]   add your team, invite them to try it, and see what you can do.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.080]   iPad, iPhone, and Android apps available for free.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.560]   podio.com.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.400]   P-O-D-I-O.com.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Really, a really neat solution from the folks at Citrix.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.000]   Sign up for free, podio.com.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.240]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.080]   It's time for the change log.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.040]   The Google change log.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.840]   And now with the log, here's Gina.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.640]   Well, it makes a lot of sense that Google just launched
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.120]   Google Keep, because Google announced this past week
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.040]   the Google Drive real time API, which essentially
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   gives developers the ability to build in real time character,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.960]   character by character as you type updates to their apps.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.520]   So this is really only news for developers,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.400]   although there were a couple of apps out there that already
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:12.880]   used this.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.320]   It looks like Keep uses this.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.840]   There's also an app called Neutron, which
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.720]   is a code editor, a collaborative code editor,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.000]   so you can store your code files in Drive.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.680]   And this is great for something like pair programming.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.840]   There's a project management tool called Gantor,
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.960]   which also uses live updates to the drawings app in Google Drive
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.640]   and draw.io as well.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.120]   So Google Drive real time API at work in Google Keep.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.000]   So it makes a lot of sense to keep just launched.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.840]   What else are we going on?
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.240]   Oh, I was sucked into an image search for your--
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.760]   We could barely get Gina back.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.680]   Everyone was in a deep discussion about web video formats.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.640]   And I was looking at animated GIFs of Justin Bieber,
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.600]   because--
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.120]   Why?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120]   Why?
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.360]   --people has animated to the list of image types
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.160]   that you can search for in image search.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.600]   So if you run a search for images like Grumpy Cat or Leo
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.400]   Port or Justin Bieber, you can select from the type of file
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.040]   that you get back.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.760]   There's a new option called animated.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.600]   So you can say--
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.360]   Where do you do that?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.480]   I can't-- I don't see it.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.080]   Where do I select?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.920]   So images.google.com-- I think they call it the tool belt.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.440]   So let's try this.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.840]   Here we go.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.880]   Any type.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.240]   So you use search tools.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.560]   If you look at my chat, you're doing it.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:26.840]   All right.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.400]   Any type animated, then it will show you all the animated.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.560]   But it doesn't animate the GIFs.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.440]   You have to go there.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   It doesn't animate them in the tiled results list, which
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.200]   probably is good, because that would probably cause seizures.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.480]   You have to click on an image to see the animation.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.680]   I kind of was disappointed.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.440]   I wanted to see all the animations happening.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.680]   I wanted to see the good UI choice,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.640]   because if they were all moving at once, it would be distressing.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.120]   Oh, so let's try this to help out to--
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.000]   And let you scale them all their animated easily, do they?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.240]   Yeah, it probably wouldn't work all their way.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:06.000]   Here's me from FARC.com as a max headroom.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.560]   This is actually what's going to happen.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.120]   I like that one.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.440]   In a couple of years, this is all that's going to be left of me.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.160]   I like that one a lot.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.560]   People are capturing images now so they can create the max headroom.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.080]   This is fun.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.880]   On the other hand, you will make so much revenue
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.160]   from the blipverts you'll be fine.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.600]   Oh, thank god for blipverts.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.480]   It really is exploding.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.000]   Right.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.600]   This is good.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.680]   This is fun.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.600]   Yeah, fun.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.720]   So again, it's not immediately obvious it
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.400]   wasn't to me because I'm a fool.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.880]   You do the image search, but then you click the search tools.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.840]   So you know what's missing here?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.480]   So if I look at this web images map shopping,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.960]   more has a downward triangle.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.360]   OK, that indicates if I tap it, there'll be more.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.960]   Search tools-- I don't know what's going to happen when I hit that.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.120]   Yeah, I know what that is.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.160]   What a search search search for.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   So UI is going to be filters or something like that.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   Maybe dot dot dot would let me know that something's
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.720]   going to happen when I tap it.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.200]   Something.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.520]   And then we get underneath, we get a new menu bar that gives you
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.600]   size, color, animated, any type.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.880]   So that's the thing is it wasn't immediately obvious.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.520]   If you tap that search tool, and then you can search any type,
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   face, photo, clip art, line drawing, and the new type is animated.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Animated.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:18.120]   And the grumpy cat results are also worth looking at.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.240]   We have a new Gmail for Android update that came out this week,
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.120]   and it takes advantage of Jelly Bean and ICS rich notifications.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.200]   So now when you get notifications about new email,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.640]   you can pull down the interactive notifications
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.080]   in Android's window shade.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.920]   You can reply or you can--
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.240]   We may never know what you can do.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   We can--
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   There we go.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   We froze for a moment there, Gina.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.960]   You can reply or what?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.080]   Reply or archive.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.280]   Archive, OK.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.840]   I love rich notifications, by the way.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   But then we work if you get one email at a time.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.120]   Otherwise, they collapse into three, like before.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.640]   Oh.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.120]   It's kind of an--
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   Can't you pull it down?
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.440]   Can you do the two finger pull down and expand them?
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.800]   No, then I just get the three still.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.920]   So this is the Gmail app.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.600]   You can't use the Mail app in Android.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.280]   You have to use the Gmail app for this to work.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:10.800]   Right.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.320]   This is the Gmail app.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.000]   Hope that I get a single email in at a time.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.320]   What you can do is you can set up your notifications
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.720]   to only notify you if you say you get important messages.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.920]   I use a VIP.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.240]   I do the VIP messages.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.960]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.160]   I honestly turned off my Gmail notifications
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   because it's just too much.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.280]   But I feel like with these notifications,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.400]   I might just filter down from my business partner, my mom,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.800]   just from the real important people.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   That's exactly what I'm doing now.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   That's awesome.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.440]   I should play with that.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.880]   Turn my notifications back on.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.080]   But now, how do we--
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.840]   I don't see a way to narrow those notifications down.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.280]   Sit in the general settings.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.480]   No, it's--
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.000]   Let's see.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.080]   It looks like just notifications on or off.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.240]   I can make priority inbox the default inbox.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.040]   I guess I presume then that that will give me what I want.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.520]   Priority inbox, sign-in, fly-through.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.880]   All income messages, only important.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.440]   Only messages in certain labels, right?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   So you have to set up a label for--
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.840]   Ah, label notifications.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.480]   I see.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.000]   OK.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.840]   So if you have like a VIP label, then you can say only notify me.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.320]   We're going to message this label.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.440]   There we go.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.600]   Was that hidden?
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.960]   Is that-- are the desktop version on the phone?
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   Is it on the desktop?
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.640]   Do you know how it can fit in?
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   It's in the app on the phone.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.240]   It's in the app, isn't it?
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.320]   But it didn't manage labels.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.040]   No, I'm looking in--
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.120]   Settings.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.720]   Maybe we need to check for updates.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.120]   I'm looking.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.640]   Huh.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.560]   I think that's pretty exciting.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.040]   If you click priority inbox, sign-in, vibrate.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.880]   No, but that's label notifications are turned on now.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.160]   But I don't know--
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.760]   I don't know how to narrow that down.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.200]   I don't want to notify for every message.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.760]   Right.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.160]   Oh, maybe label notifications means notify
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.000]   use labels to--
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.320]   It's kind of ambiguous.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   OK.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:03.800]   So--
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.440]   I'm going to--
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.880]   Yeah, I'm going to--
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   I'm going to--
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.760]   Yeah, we'll figure out.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.920]   There's definitely-- I'm actually
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.440]   looking at the very helpful answer.py file here.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   Oh.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.940]   Oh.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.040]   You've got to it from the left, please.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.360]   It just says, when she mail out to Android,
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.080]   you can choose that you're notified of incoming messages.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   Set up your notifications.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.080]   OK.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.240]   So only messages are certain labels.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.600]   In the Gmail app, touch menu, then settings, choose an account.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.960]   Make sure the box next to notifications is checked.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.460]   Ah.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.120]   Touch managed--
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.960]   So you have to do that.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.440]   --touch managed labels.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.880]   OK.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.920]   Touch managed labels, and then touch inbox.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.040]   And make sure label notifications is not checked.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   Use your back button to get back to your list.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.840]   You can sure do this.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.080]   This is a little left step.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.520]   This is a little left step.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   I'm just a constructions, folks.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.360]   I'm going to go back to what?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:47.880]   And then do what?
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   And then do what?
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.480]   Touch sync messages.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.200]   Choose either sync last 30 days or sync all.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.680]   Check the box next to label notifications.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.160]   OK.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.920]   I've done that.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   Now what?
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:58.920]   OK.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.120]   Now choose how you want to be notified with the following--
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.620]   Right.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.920]   Sound, vibrate, notify for every message.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.120]   Right.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.760]   I don't want that.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.560]   OK.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.240]   For any label you want notifications for,
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   you can choose different ringtones for different labels.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   Wow.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.320]   That was a journey into the settings of the Gmail app.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   I was like, what was it?
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520]   I'm still lost.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.840]   You're still lost.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.840]   For label notifications, inside priority in bugs.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.480]   OK.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.320]   Whatever.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   You let's say you could do it.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.640]   Continue on.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.120]   OK.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.520]   All right.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.320]   Let's accept that as written.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:32.800]   Move on.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.400]   It is there.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.000]   It is deep.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.920]   It was deep in the bounds.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.880]   Do a nice search.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.600]   And Google support pages.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.040]   You'll find it.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.880]   But it is indeed possible to get notifications
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.720]   for only certain labels.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.200]   Perfect.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.160]   Google Plus.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.640]   Google Plus is getting a new Hangouts app called Capture,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   which lets you snap pictures of your Hangout as you're talking.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.600]   So I honestly don't use Hangout a whole lot.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.640]   They're calling it an app.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.440]   I think what that means is that it's just a button,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.160]   a new button in the toolbar on the left side menu
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.520]   within Hangouts.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.440]   This app is pretty well done.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.360]   I mean, it does more than just take a screenshot of a Hangout.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.200]   When you take a screenshot, it lets everybody in your Hangout
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.360]   know that you have indeed taken a picture.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.760]   It automatically shares or saves that picture
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.480]   into your Google Plus and shares it
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.680]   with all the people who are also in the Hangout.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.840]   So they can look at the pictures as they're being snapped.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.360]   And you can view the photos while you're in the Hangout.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.840]   And you'll know when it's in use.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.400]   So it's a difference between-- if you're
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.680]   going to hang out, someone uses a skit
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.480]   or someone uses some other way to take a screenshot,
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.000]   you don't know if someone's taking a picture of you.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.360]   But this app actually notifies you and lets you know, hey,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.640]   pose would take a picture.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.920]   So it looks like a cute app.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.240]   I have to say.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.920]   Nice way to remember.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.960]   You know, kind of funny.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.240]   Do you do a lot of Hangouts?
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.080]   You know, I don't.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.520]   I don't.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.720]   But every time I look at it, I think
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.800]   I really need to do this with my family more.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.160]   So I do a lot of video conferencing
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.560]   with Nona with the family, especially now with the baby.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.080]   I don't know why we wouldn't just use Hangouts.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.000]   Part of it is just like--
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.920]   What do you use Skype?
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.040]   Yeah, you use Skype in FaceTime just
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.920]   because the family relatives have iPads.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.280]   So FaceTime is kind of like the easiest experience there.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.120]   Or you Skype.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.520]   But it seems like Hangouts is a really good option,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.000]   especially with all those funny effects and stuff.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.560]   I feel like the kids would love the little, the mustache
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.880]   and the horns and then the classes,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.840]   the little effects that you can add to people.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.240]   I've used it quite a bit.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.640]   And also, if you're wondering, once you snap a picture,
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   it also shares underneath the Hangouts.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.920]   So when you see the, hey, Hangouts going on here,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.200]   the people in it, there's another little drop down
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.720]   of photos.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.200]   Oh, I like that.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.800]   So you could see, oh, this was going on.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.480]   And they hang out.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:36.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.160]   They're having fun.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.880]   There are people who are having fun.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.240]   Right.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.120]   What do I want to join?
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.680]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.600]   There's 10 people in there.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Sorry.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.120]   You can join.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   FOMO.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   FOMO.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:47.720]   FOMO.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.240]   Sometimes fun is FOMO.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.920]   Having so much fun.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.080]   You wish you were here.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.960]   All right, two more last things.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   Google Maps gets the seven summits.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.320]   I had never heard of the seven summits,
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   but they are the highest mountain on each of the seven
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.000]   continents is now in Google Maps.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.120]   Are you talking Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbreth, Mount Everest,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.760]   or?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.800]   You can go to the peaks these mountains on Google Maps.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.000]   You believe this?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.200]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.720]   Really?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.040]   They must have had a Googler who was like into mountain
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   climbing.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.120]   So I think Google came up with a brilliant idea of that.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.800]   I need to go to the seven highest mountains around the world.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.680]   It'll be like 20% project, really.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.200]   Yeah, this is clearly some bucket list checking off going
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   on here.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.640]   I can't imagine hiking these mountains
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   with those huge, enormous 360 cameras on my back.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.480]   I don't know how heavy those things are,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.720]   but these are some serious hikers that did this.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.520]   Well, especially Everest.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.760]   Caroline McConaughey just went to Kilimanjaro.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.520]   But I bet she's left Google now, OK?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   I seem to remember having read that there was one person at
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.000]   Google who was an avid mountain climber who had made this
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.920]   happen.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.360]   Last thing-- and Leo, you probably talked about this.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   I don't know if you talked about this with Steve Gibson,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.640]   but Google has implemented DNS sec validation on their
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.040]   public DNS service.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   Yay.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.240]   So this is the domain name system security extensions.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.600]   Let me make sure that I get this right.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.760]   So this means that Google's public DNS resolvers actually
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   do validate whether or not DNS requests are indeed valid.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.680]   They used to just forward those requests.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.600]   What this basically means is that just on top of SSL, this
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.160]   makes for more secure internet, where DNS resolution is
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.600]   verified within Google's public DNS service as well.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.240]   I hope I didn't mangle that too badly.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.760]   I think that's perfect.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.480]   Great.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.720]   And that's it for the change log.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.240]   There is, by the way, Google Maps folks on Google+ had a
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.440]   hangout with the mappers that you can go back and watch the
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.200]   seven people talking about mapping the world's highest peaks.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.680]   So they had one hiker per mountain?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.280]   I guess.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.360]   There's seven people, seven peaks.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.040]   Hi, everyone.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.000]   And welcome to our very special hangout today.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.080]   We are celebrating our special collection with Street View
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.360]   of the world's tallest peaks.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   So today we have some of the most famous and highest peaks
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.240]   around the world.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:09.960]   That's cool.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.120]   The Everest Base Camp.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.160]   So I'm glad-- you know, it's nice that Google uses their
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.280]   own tools to do corporate communications, things like that.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.520]   Very cool.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.800]   Yeah, so much so that the Google blogs are kind of going
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   away.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.160]   I mean, they're mostly all Google+, they're making new
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.360]   product announcements on Google+.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.640]   Why not?
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.440]   Well, yeah, now that reader's gone, that'll be better
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.040]   waiting for me to prep for the show.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.680]   Is that it?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.840]   Do we get-- is that all of it?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.560]   That's all I got.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.000]   That's all I got.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.880]   That's the Google change log.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.160]   And I presume next week we'll mention Babel, because there's
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.640]   all this rumor flying about Google Babel.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.200]   A new unified messaging platform.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.000]   Yeah, I'm excited about that.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.480]   Do you think it's going to happen before I/O?
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.560]   I hope so.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.360]   Maybe they'll do it at I/O.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   Perhaps they'll do it at I/O.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.880]   That seems like a big enough kind of I/O announcement.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.720]   Is this-- I guess it is something we need, because you've
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.360]   got messaging in Google+, you've got Google Talk.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.560]   Yeah, Google Voice.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.840]   Google Voice, I use that all the time for messaging,
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   because as kind of an alternative to text messaging.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.680]   There's your phone SMS messaging if you're in your phone.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.720]   So if they tie that in, essentially,
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.000]   then it becomes the equivalent of Apple's message
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.320]   is zap.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.200]   Message right, I message.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.400]   I message.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   I think it's called message now.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.080]   Oh, is it just called messages?
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.520]   I think they dropped the I.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:41.080]   So Babel, I guess this is a leak coming from the geek.com.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:47.440]   They quote, "numerous sources."
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.520]   Chat for drive.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.440]   I've never used that.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.880]   There's chat for drive, too.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.680]   Oh, yeah, in the talk chat.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.880]   Yeah, we use it all the time.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.680]   We use it all the time.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.200]   We use it all the time.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.700]   Of course.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.440]   Yeah, so you didn't even know it.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:57.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.760]   But we do use it.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.280]   When we're in the-- when we're all in the doc,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   we'll chat with each other, say, you know, wow,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.080]   this is a really boring show.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.720]   Stuff like that.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.240]   You know, it's like, chat, I can't hear anything.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.720]   What's going on?
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.000]   But yeah, I didn't realize how many messaging products
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.800]   Google really has.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.760]   I mean, you know, right about this.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.560]   I was like, oh, yeah, this means complete sense.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.840]   Presumably, it all sits on top of XMPP,
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.320]   so not so difficult to implement, right?
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.720]   Right.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   I mean, there's--
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.640]   Right.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   Yeah, there's the XMPP thing that they use all over the place.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.880]   And this has been around for a while.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.240]   I, Google, has it, and Glass and Orkut all
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.720]   had the little pop up chat window.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.880]   So I actually love XMPP.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.320]   Jabber was an XMPP client.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.960]   So it's an open source platform for messaging, really, more
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.120]   than chat, messaging of all kinds.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.280]   We've thought for a long time that we would use XMPP
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.000]   to do some sort of river of textual information associated
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   with our shows.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.280]   We set up the backbone, but we never really kind of
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.920]   pulled the trigger on that.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.520]   Do we still have our XMPP server running?
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.720]   I think we do.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.400]   Twit.im.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.280]   No one knows.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.080]   It's just sitting there.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   No, bear says.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.600]   It gets a lot of use.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.960]   Bear said it was turned off.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.840]   Oh.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.560]   Babel will almost certainly use XMPP since I think all
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.920]   of those Google services do.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.960]   In fact, Google decided to block non-native XMPP requests.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.440]   Well, we'll throttle them, I think it was.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.480]   Throttle them, OK.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.960]   It was-- they will only allow so many per day
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.600]   from a certain domain, because they
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.760]   were getting a sort of spam bot domains that were attacking
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.000]   them.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.360]   So it's Google's BlackBerry Messenger.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.240]   No, that's a mean thing to say.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.280]   I mean, if it's built on XMPP, that's good.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.120]   That means it keeps you in trouble.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.720]   Right?
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.920]   Did they-- someone in the chat room said they're dropping aim,
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.760]   but I thought aim was built into--
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.280]   they had an aim bridge in the chat thing, at least.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   Not that I've actually tried using aim recently,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.080]   but they're--
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.920]   My person killed Messenger, so there's
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.400]   one viewer thing to worry about.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.920]   They've converged on Skype for that.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.320]   Does it-- what does Skype use?
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.440]   Skype uses his own transport, right?
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.320]   I don't actually know.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.840]   And then the other sort of subtext of this
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.720]   is WebRTC enables some of this, too.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.120]   There's a data channel and not that can use for chat.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.920]   Right.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.600]   There's the chat-- sorry, there's the text channel
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   and a data channel and that.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.920]   For some reason, I just feel like this is a very--
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.720]   that people don't make phone calls anymore.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.280]   They use text messaging, and that's
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.800]   such an inadequate system, not to mention expensive,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.360]   because the carriers really gouge people for text messaging,
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.760]   that they're just a natural value in some sort
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.720]   of unified messaging service.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.360]   Goodness knows, a service is like what's
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.720]   apt to really, really well.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.120]   They do, but as long as you can chat--
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.440]   I think it's a cross-platform.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.520]   It needs to be cross-platform.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.160]   It needs to be every--
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.200]   Yeah, it needs to be cross-platform.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.720]   As long as it doesn't lock people out into Google services,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.220]   right?
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.640]   So which is what messages does on iOS.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.240]   I've heard from people say, I want to switch to iOS re-indroid
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.920]   by depending on messages or messaging.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.320]   I mean, and I can't move.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.760]   Right.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.600]   It bitches to SMS, but that's it.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.480]   So yeah, you're stuck with SMS.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   And for the monocle people.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.000]   Right.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Right.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.840]   Right.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.760]   But it's weird.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.440]   If someone sends you-- so if you use messages at one point
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.880]   and someone sends you a message--
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.080]   like, I used to use it.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:35.840]   I don't need more.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.920]   And then every once in a while, I'll be like, oh,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.760]   someone sent me something a while ago, and I just never got it,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.720]   because it doesn't forward just the iCloud email address.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.040]   And it's frustrating.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.400]   It's like, oh, this isn't an open standard.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.320]   I can't log into this with any chat client.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.680]   Someone in our chat room just said, oh, people use AMLOL.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   And I think I still use AM.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.400]   I mean, I don't even know what I use.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.640]   I just use ADM, and I log into the Google Messenger and AM.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.400]   And I log into everything.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.640]   The five or six chat accounts that I set up five years--
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.840]   six years ago, eight years ago.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.480]   But I don't think about it anymore.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.120]   You shouldn't have to think about the protocol.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.480]   That seems like a kind of a Cluji solution.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.640]   A pigeon, AME, Trillian, all of these multiple client
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.560]   are multiple protocol clients.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.280]   Well, that was the problem was that this stuff didn't converge.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   There was a time when everyone was trying to interact.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.960]   And then there was a massive back and forth
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.400]   walk between Microsoft and AME, where Microsoft would
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.160]   implement the protocol, and AME would change it.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   And it actually gave up.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.640]   I remember those days.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.000]   And then AME licensed it to Apple, which was in iChat,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.520]   which was good.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:37.960]   That was nice.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.600]   Then he had that and that did Jabba as well.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.280]   And then Apple sort of damaged that,
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.920]   never bought it to the iPhone.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.560]   And then they re-emended again with iMessage.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.440]   So Apple has been lagging on this for a while.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.640]   Whereas Google has picked up on Jabba Fair,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   Ali early on, and then built a integration to that.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.560]   So it makes sense to trample this together.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.200]   And XMPP is a decent protocol for doing it, I think.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.280]   Who better to do it than Google, really?
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   Maybe Yahoo?
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.480]   Yahoo just bought a client called Jib.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.720]   Look at this.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.280]   JY-D-E.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.600]   Oh, that's a recommendation site.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.160]   That's not related.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   Recommendations started.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   What was the one you were thinking of?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.600]   There was some other one you were thinking of.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.080]   I'm with the J.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:23.440]   I don't know.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.600]   I'm one of those.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   Jabba.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.800]   Nope.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.120]   No.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.920]   Jabba's open source.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.760]   But Yahoo has a chat.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.200]   You people use Yahoo chat still.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.080]   Jive.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.520]   That's it.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.680]   Is it Jive?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.320]   No, no.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.880]   Be Jive?
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.400]   Is that something else?
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.600]   Be Jive?
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   Jitzy.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   Jitzy.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   Thank you.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   Thank you, VIX360.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   Everybody get Jive.com.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.240]   Get Jive.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   Jitzy, VIX360.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.240]   Oh, should we still got IRC?
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   So we've got a chat thing that actually works.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   Thank God.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   IRC really works.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.720]   Wouldn't it be great if we could just unify everything under IRC?
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.680]   That was actually one of the neat things about Pigeon.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.720]   And I think Trillion did this too, is you could have an IRC channel in theirs along with
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.560]   everything else.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.400]   Be Jive is Be Jive but it's pronounced Be Jive.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   Never mind.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   I'm so confused.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   I used it.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.160]   It's a multi chat client.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.000]   I think on multiple platforms.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Anyway.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.640]   Oh, Be Jive.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   Oh, Be Jive.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   Oh, Be Jive.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.280]   Oh, Be Jive.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.240]   Yeah, Chat Room is my externalized brain.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.540]   And they are actually now having a psychotic break of some kind.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:42.280]   So moving on, Google may be reddering a newsstand like feature.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   We've got Google Music.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   We've got Google Books.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.340]   We've got Google Play, maybe Google News or Google Play News with issues and subscriptions
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.140]   is coming from the next web.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.140]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.600]   Who's dying to subscribe to--
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.100]   More magazines in a different platform.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.420]   And a different platform.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   Why?
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.420]   Why?
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.900]   Do you read magazines on your iPad or your tablet or anything?
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.060]   Where do you pick them up in the newsstand and read them in paper form?
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.700]   I've been sort of interested in the mini sort of publishing thing that's been going
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.820]   on with the Magmarker Romance magazine and 29 Street Publishing with the All and Weekend
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.820]   Companion.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.700]   And I did subscribe to a couple of them.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.740]   And it is good content.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.220]   And I do like the interface.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.620]   I truly, I just sort of suffer from a too many gadgets problem where I just have an
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.300]   Nexus 7, I have my Galaxy Nexus, I have the iPad, I have my computer.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.860]   I just don't know what to pick up yet.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:53.780]   So honestly, they do sort of stack up on my iPad the way that physical magazines would
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.780]   as well in my house.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.540]   Oh, I get to New Yorker on my iPad, but I never read it.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.220]   You never read it.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.220]   But it's there.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.900]   If I ever get bored or lonely, I got the New Yorker.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.020]   I got 800 issues in the Yorker.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.180]   But you know, the funny thing is I still subscribe to the paper New Yorker, but at least I, you
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.140]   know, I, yeah, it's just more stuff not to read.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.780]   It's a spectator and kindled, but I forget to read it.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.980]   Yeah, the economist is another one I get.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.780]   Is Amazon, should Amazon own this?
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.060]   Then we wouldn't have to worry about Apple and Google having incompatible.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.700]   Amazon has this too.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.380]   But they are locked inside Amazon.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   So I mean, you know, it just, they just need to be e-pubs and they need to be HTML and
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.740]   then the work and you don't have to do it.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   That's the way to do it.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   But nobody's going to do that because they want to control this.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.820]   They're already published, but they're all trying to wrap them up in DRM nonsense.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.820]   Right.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:53.540]   Well, maybe the things like Marcos, the magazine, but the magazine is just another silo.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.540]   Isn't it?
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.660]   I know he's written for it.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.660]   I have.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.660]   I have.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   Yeah, in many ways it is.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.660]   It's on a one platform.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.140]   It's a pay for that you can't.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.780]   I think there's a way to share links to articles, but it's kind of limited.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.140]   So many clicks or so many shares that you can give it.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.300]   Yeah, it's a silo.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   It's true.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.940]   I've read it.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940]   You know what?
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.180]   There's this thing called the worldwide web.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.340]   Works so very well.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.420]   It's a standard of plays back on every platform.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:26.100]   I look at the Atlantic Monthly, which made the decision to go web.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.220]   I suppose they have an app, but they have the web, the magazines on the web.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.460]   It's just a great way to do it.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.420]   And then, oh, it would be really cool.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.460]   You could have some sort of aggregator, have a list of all the articles, and then you could
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.460]   do it.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.300]   You could scan them and quickly look and see what was new from all the different sources.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.100]   And what's going on?
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.740]   I mean, it seems like we're moving backwards.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.740]   We're moving the wrong way.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.780]   Well, it's a difference between paying advertisers versus having your readers pay you.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.780]   Right?
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   I mean, Marco's actually like he's making a lot of money for the magazine enough money
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.500]   to pay his writers really well.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.220]   Because he wrote ads, it's completely trimmed down.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.220]   What is it?
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.060]   99 cents a month, right?
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   Something like that.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.580]   I recently unsubscribed because I never read it.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.380]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.460]   He's sort of depending on people who are either voracious readers and big fans or really plugged
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.940]   into that community, or he's depending on people to just forget that they're subscribed.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.700]   I mean, Apple sends a reminder email.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.700]   It's hard to forget.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.500]   iTunes makes it easy to cancel.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.140]   They're much easier than other platforms.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   They let you know.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   They remind you you've got a subscription.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.620]   There's a subscription area.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.060]   I can see all the things I was paying for.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.540]   And I said, oh, yeah, I don't want that.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   Oh, yeah, I don't want that.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.540]   It's too easy.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.540]   You know, it's so cheap though, I think.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.460]   Well, you know, I won't read it.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.540]   I won't read it this month.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.180]   It's only three bucks, you know, whatever it is.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.380]   Google acquired.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.580]   Tilaria, which I'm sorry.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.900]   I don't think you should name a company, anything that rhymes with malaria.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.340]   It says the guy who runs a company named Swit.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.340]   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, you're right.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.940]   I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:10.140]   Tilaria was building a quote, new dynamic web application server with a JIT based runtime
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.580]   at its heart.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.500]   It'll become part of the cloud platform team.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.300]   I don't even understand what I don't know.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.700]   It was on PHP, which is a little odd.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.300]   But I guess because WordPress and Drupal are in PHP, it makes sense.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   Interesting.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.020]   It's just more HTML5, JavaScript stuff.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.180]   It's an acquire.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.980]   They're hiring these five people.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.660]   I hope they support PHP and App Engine though.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.620]   I hope that that's what this means.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.260]   Ah, they don't currently.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.260]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.060]   Well, you know, Google's the Python company.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.220]   What about the PHP company?
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.500]   I bet you're right.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.340]   This might add PHP to Google Cloud Platform.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.340]   That's cool.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.340]   There you go.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.180]   I wonder, you know, if there's a possibility of a web store on market where you just deploy
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.220]   cloud-based apps, like say, "Hey, give me Drupal.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   Give me WordPress.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:18.180]   Give me think of, give me feed a fever," or, you know, any of those sort of PHP, you know,
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.180]   install yourself.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:25.420]   There are apps, some which are in the running for, you know, replace Google Reader.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:34.420]   Continuing his tour of totalitarian-based dictator-run countries, Google Schmidt is going to Myanmar.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.580]   I don't know why.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:45.300]   It'll be the first high-level executive from a US technology giant ever to visit Myanmar.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:53.420]   60 million people, remember he was in North Korea last month, is Myanmar still run by
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.260]   the military Hunta?
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   Are they still?
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260]   Yeah, I didn't say.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.660]   It's nominally civilian.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.020]   The government is nominally civilian.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.820]   It says under the, oh, now, okay, so they're no longer under the military government.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.820]   So it's opening up.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.100]   Ah, so this might be a good place to go.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.140]   The government's pushing mobile phone ownership.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.180]   It's 9% right now.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.180]   They hope to get it to 80% by 2016, which means anybody in the mobile space is going
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.140]   to have big growth.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.860]   So that's why Eric went there.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.860]   That makes sense.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.500]   US Treasury Department regulations still prohibit American companies from dealing with a list
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.740]   of more than 100 individuals still considered cronies of the former military regime, many
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:42.100]   of whom continue to hold powerful and influential business positions.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.780]   So you have to be a little careful.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.020]   There are still sanctions, but things are opening up in Myanmar.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.020]   I didn't realize that.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.020]   That's good.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.620]   Yeah, it looks like that's the place for Schmidt to be.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.620]   Yep.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.820]   Chromebooks glow global now available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.820]   Netherlands.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.580]   I'm still waiting for my pixel.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.580]   You need to countdown.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:07.580]   I do.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.300]   Well, they don't tell you, right?
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.780]   If you go to the store, it says, yeah, you ordered one two to three weeks.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.780]   They don't.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.500]   There's no tracking or anything because I ordered the LTE version.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:24.020]   I wanted to have always on internet on my pixel, but I will review it as you cover
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.660]   a glio and a pixel.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.660]   That would be awesome.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.660]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.020]   We can Skype from the pixel.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.860]   Yeah, or whatever it is.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.020]   The pixel does it use Skype?
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.700]   No, you have to use WebRTC.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.740]   Well, you can use Google talk.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.700]   Hang out.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.140]   If you, yeah, I can put Linux on it.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.140]   That's what Jeff was doing.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.300]   It actually worked quite well.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.100]   Yeah, it worked quite well.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   Have you used a Chromebook?
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.180]   Kevin, are you a Chromebook fan or?
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.180]   I haven't.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.860]   I've got one of the ones I got, the original one that I use every now and then.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   CR48.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.020]   No, no, the one we got last year.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.020]   Oh, the Samsung.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.420]   So it's no, we'll hear before whenever it was.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   Anyway, that's that's that.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.420]   That's just around at home.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.420]   I keep it charged.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.220]   I use it now and then.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.700]   I if we got someone visiting, then I'll, you know, and they want to use the net.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.700]   I'll give them that.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.700]   That's what I did.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.700]   I gave away my Chromebooks to people who needed computers.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.700]   Well, I've still got the Chrome boxes.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.700]   Nobody wants to want those.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.700]   You can't.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.580]   I don't see those in the play store anymore.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.220]   Can you still buy those?
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.820]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.580]   Yes, you have to go to Amazon.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.740]   It's not that you can buy them on Amazon.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.660]   Well, they didn't they didn't do them.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.660]   It wasn't in the device area.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.020]   It was never in the devices.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.020]   Yes.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.420]   It was like the Samsung Chromebooks that you went to Amazon.com and bought them.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:43.340]   So the Pixel is still US only, I believe, but they are going to make the Acer, the HP,
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.900]   and the Samsung Chromebooks available, as I said in Australia, Canada, France, Germany,
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.060]   Ireland, and the Netherlands.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.580]   I didn't realize that they weren't widely available internationally.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.500]   You know, Google tablets are other Google devices.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.820]   I went ahead and made you a countdown Leo just to go.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.820]   Oh, good.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.820]   Our arbitrary what?
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:09.780]   It's 249 hours, 14,972 minutes, 898,352 seconds.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.580]   So, you know, two to three weeks, right?
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.060]   So it's in there somewhere.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.740]   I bet it'll come exactly.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.860]   Yeah, what is the site?
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:25.220]   So this is timeanddate.com and you can create these cool little, you know, data.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.300]   And so you could even make it go, you know, I just discovered.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.540]   I just discovered time.is, which I really like.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.580]   I also love world time, buddy, as well.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.340]   There's a lot of time based people on the internet.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.660]   We don't need a lot of time and they love weather.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.940]   It's just data.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   It's constant data.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:56.780]   The thing about time.io is time.is is it will tell you how close your, it's very accurate.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:02.260]   And it will tell you how close your clock is on your computer.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.260]   Very accurately.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.260]   Oh my clock.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.260]   Wow.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.340]   Yeah, see yours is 4.8 seconds ahead.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.500]   How much was mine is 1.1 seconds.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.500]   See there you go.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.620]   Because we both using some sort of automatic synchronization.
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.620]   And then it's see it.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.940]   And then you see the latency issue, which is actually surprisingly low.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.220]   It's like half a second, half second latency between one of your screens in mind.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   That's interesting.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.740]   No, I'm not how they're doing this.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.980]   Normally, when you do something like this client, you know, client side, you're getting
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:32.220]   the, I'm more amazed that you have a, you know, a lot of time.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.180]   So some sort of thing with a, our fonts are different.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.180]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.180]   Yeah, I want windows.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.180]   Oh, windows.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.180]   No one windows.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.180]   It probably doesn't have that font.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.780]   Can we feel free to think we could laugh?
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.420]   It couldn't do aerial close.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   I don't know.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   What do you ask me for?
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   I don't know.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   I don't know.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.060]   I'm more amazed that it's a serif versus a sancin.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.060]   I have serif.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.060]   Ballmer.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.060]   I don't know.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.060]   Like there's completely different.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.060]   Anyway, I know.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.060]   I know.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   I'm getting a serif.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   You're not.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.540]   You know, that's, I'm in Chrome.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.780]   I wonder what it would look like in the Internet Explorer.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.780]   Let's try that one.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.100]   It's this is this is aerial sensor from the styling.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   So they.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.180]   Yeah, Chrome is ignoring it.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   Chrome is ignoring it.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.980]   Let's see what the Internet Explorer.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.580]   No, it's an explorer is also a serif font.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.980]   That's okay.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.860]   What I wonder what Metro is.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:31.260]   This is one of the most wonderful things about the, the lovely time.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.900]   Is not Metro's also a serif.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.900]   So I have a.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.420]   It's so it's written a sensor is a serif.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.420]   That's just weird.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.420]   It's wrong.
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   Right?
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.420]   You shouldn't.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:48.220]   Well, Kevin, you just said you looked at the seat and it's for aerial bad.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.220]   Cause the area was censored.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.220]   All right.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:58.700]   Hold that thought because before we talk more about the goog and the beeb with the
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.020]   gene and the kev, let's talk about the ting.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.020]   Ting.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.020]   Oh, I love ting.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   Ting.com.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.620]   Actually, if you go to twig.ting.com, you get a special offer.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.620]   What is ting?
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:15.980]   It is a new mobile phone service that just is done right with integrity.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.540]   No BS.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.220]   You know, you never pay more.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.220]   There's no ETFs.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.220]   There's no contracts.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   You never pay over his charges.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.980]   You never pay penalties.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.540]   You get credit on the service you don't use.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.020]   And if you use more service than you thought you would, no problem.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.220]   You just pay at the same rate you would if you bought it in the first place.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.220]   No add on charges either.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   What do you get from ting?
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.220]   You get voicemail.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.380]   You get caller ID.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:43.100]   You get tethering, tethering part of the deal, hotspot part of the deal.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.460]   And I in unlimited devices on one plan, so go to twig.ting.com and find out more about
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.460]   what ting can do for you.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:57.220]   You know, it's a fun one to go is the calculator, the savings calculator there on the menu item.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.380]   Bring your phone bill, your current mobile phone bill because you can compare how much
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.740]   exactly the same service it costs from ting.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.700]   Now ting ting uses the Sprint network.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:11.820]   So if Sprint works where you are, and it does in almost everywhere in the country, ting is
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.220]   a great solution for you.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.300]   You can bring your LTE device to ting, by the way.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.340]   Sprint has now opened that up and ting is of course going to take advantage of that.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:25.740]   If you have a Sprint device from the list of supported phones, you don't need to buy a
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.460]   new one, just bring it over to ting.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:33.660]   And you can just change a couple of settings, make some updates, and you'll be saving right
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.620]   away.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.740]   Ting is an amazing thing.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.020]   Let's do a little ting plan just to show you.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:44.900]   You pick how many phones you want, any number of phones on the same shared service, but let's
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.340]   say it's a family of four, six dollars per phone per month.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:54.060]   We're going to use, let's say, shared 2,000 minutes, just a thousand text messages, and
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.220]   I'll show you why it doesn't really matter what you pick in a moment, three gigabytes
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.180]   of data.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.500]   And I mentioned hotspot and tethering automatically.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.660]   That's 124 a month for all four of you.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.580]   And the beauty part is, if you use more, you just pay at the standard rate.
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.180]   If you use less, they rebate you what you paid.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:18.260]   So if you go right now to twig.ting.com, sign up today, you're going to love it, and
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:23.980]   you'll save $25 on your first device to all the major, you know, hot phones are there.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.140]   Twig.ting.com.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.900]   Good riddance to that lousy cell phone company you're using.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.740]   Ting is the thing.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   Try it today.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.260]   You're going to love it.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   What do you think?
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.660]   What free stuff are we going to get at Google IO?
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:44.060]   Oh, you, by the way, we got to get Kevin in, right?
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.700]   Kevin asked me if he could get in.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700]   Can we get him in?
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.700]   I didn't even get an invitation.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   You did.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.700]   Oh, I did.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.700]   So I've been talking to the Google I folks trying to get.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:57.380]   They say that Jason Howell has one, you have one, and Jeff Jarvis has one.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.620]   And Jean is on her own recognizance.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   Right.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   Okay.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.220]   So if one of those three doesn't want to go, I've been targeting.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   That's what we did last time.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.220]   Kevin Marks was me.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.220]   Right.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.220]   I was going to say, yeah.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:12.380]   There's a possibility that Jeff will be somewhere else in, you know, out of country.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.260]   Jeff's going back and forth as he did last year.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   Right.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.380]   So he doesn't know yet because we're going to do the show.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.100]   We've decided Kevin to do the show from there.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.540]   So I will be going this year.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.540]   Okay.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.540]   Okay.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.860]   Then we talked about that last week.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.860]   Yeah, we did.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.860]   We did.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   But it's definite.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.340]   Are we going to set up at Moscone or there'd be like a studio nearby or we'll just go around
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   do interviews on inside Moscone?
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.540]   We'll figure it out later.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.900]   Oh, it's not for a couple of months.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.300]   I'm not really excited.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.300]   Sorry.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   I don't know.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   I'm really excited that you're going to be there though.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.540]   I am too.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.540]   I am too.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.540]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.740]   That's why I'm asking what free crap I'm going to get.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.100]   And then he was going to perish you out of a blimp and.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.100]   That was amazing.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.980]   That was amazing last year with the Google West.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.300]   I got to figure glass is going to figure prominently this year at I am, right?
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.660]   But we still haven't gotten our Explorer editions.
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   It's interesting.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.660]   Yeah, I want my Explorer.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.740]   You know, here's my theory.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.620]   They only asked for $1,500 guarantee because they wanted to make sure you're really into
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:14.180]   it once once they they're going to give it to everybody I know for free.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.180]   Including us.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.180]   You think?
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.180]   Really?
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   Maybe not.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   Maybe they can't afford to.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   You know, Google's been strapped lately.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.180]   I don't know.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.180]   It'd be kind of nice.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:30.580]   They're building Wi-Fi hotspots all around the Scony to accommodate the six Wi-Fi enabled
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.740]   devices that they're going to give out to everything.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.540]   Bring the Wi-Fi down.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.380]   Then have those people with the dishes pointing at you to make sure we put glasses on.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.380]   Right.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.380]   Exactly.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   That's what they did.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.380]   The dishes are flying.
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.380]   They walked by.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.380]   That's what they jumped out of the plane.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.380]   They're aiming the dish at the guy coming up.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.380]   So that's a good point.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.700]   We probably should find a studio because I bet you there will be no internet access
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.700]   at Moscone.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.100]   Yeah, we should talk off.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.740]   Does Pixelcore still have it?
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.140]   I mean, we can just talk about it now.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:04.900]   So I have been emailing the Google I folks, I/O folks and they just don't have a space
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.780]   on the floor and they just can't provide--
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   No, no, no.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.900]   Space on the final spot.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.900]   There's a few different options.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.860]   We can go over to the Sam of Art T-Room.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.300]   Well, there's also like the W hotel.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.500]   There's like across the street.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.500]   You know, we could--
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.180]   The Sam of Art T-Room guy likes us.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   All right.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.180]   But they didn't have Wi-Fi there.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.060]   So you have to bring your own Wi-Fi with you.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.060]   Oh, I thought they did.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.900]   I thought they were going to-- we talked about doing a show from there before they had bandwidth.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.380]   I don't remember talking about it.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.380]   Maybe it's not Wi-Fi.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.940]   Maybe it's just-- maybe we just plug into the kitchen.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.900]   OK, yeah, maybe this happens here.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:41.020]   I mean, when I did-- when I've done the show from there, I've sat there with the Verizon
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.580]   Thingybox and use that.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:48.620]   Liz Gaines writing for all things D talks about the future of search.
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:54.500]   Now search is evolving finally beyond caveman queries.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.540]   The conversational search metaphor.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.940]   So for instance, a meet single talking to her said, he pulls out his phone.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.300]   He says, "How old is Justin Bieber?"
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   12.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.140]   And then-- or whatever.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.140]   And then--
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.900]   Not according to his shirtless animated gifts.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.300]   Oh, baby.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.300]   I'll grown up.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.100]   And then he asks the follow-up question, "How tall is he?"
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:26.980]   And of course, a smart search will know.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.820]   It'll know 5'7", by the way, which is kind of short.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.820]   Hey, I'm 5'7".
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.220]   Yeah, but you're a girl.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.220]   I can take Bieber.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.220]   He's a shirtless Bieber.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.020]   I definitely wait until he's what they were.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.380]   The shirtless Bieber.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.820]   That sounds like something you'd see in an Autobahn bird manual.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.380]   The shirtless Bieber calls to its make.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.580]   I really have a lesbian.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.780]   It just is one of the, like, suggestions.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   Nice search.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.780]   Oh, you're in trouble.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.780]   Your credentials are now suspect, young lady.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.660]   Right now, well, it sort of looks like a girl.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.900]   So I just find my--
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:05.980]   Nobody is-- if you hadn't said anything, I wouldn't have thought a thing.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:08.660]   If you'd said you were looking for pictures of--
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.100]   I don't know.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.340]   Just in case my wife tuned in to me talking about searching for Justin Bieber.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.380]   I wasn't looking at Justin Bieber naked.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:20.980]   It's also a little bit petafile thing going on there, because he is kind of young still.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.980]   I think he's 19.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.340]   He's a beach people.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.820]   He is 19 years old.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.820]   He's just in searches.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.500]   5'7", 19 years old.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.860]   Somebody should tell Liz Gaines about these new info cards at Google, because it told me
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.620]   all that just when I typed in Justin Bieber.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.460]   Right, the knowledge graph, right?
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.460]   It's pretty good.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.740]   It was like, hey, you're talking about this person.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:41.740]   This is a pronoun.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:42.740]   This is a person.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:48.140]   It even tells me when he's playing near me in San Jose, June 26th, let's book those tickets
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   now.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.660]   I'm not going to search for Justin Bieber, because it'll show up at Google now for the
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:52.660]   rest of time.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.660]   It does.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.260]   And now I'm going to see Justin Bieber concert announcements in my Google now.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.460]   He's dreamy, though.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.260]   I mean, let's just-- let's be honest.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.860]   People who look-- people who search for-- see, this is where you don't have to worry about
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:08.420]   your credentials, Gina, because people search for Justin Bieber also search for Selena
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:13.580]   Gomez, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, and Nicki Minaj.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.300]   Not a boy in the bunch.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   Nope.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.300]   Nope.
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.300]   Nope.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.540]   Now I've got to look for animated gifts.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:27.860]   I'm telling you, teenage girls are the most beautiful and animated gifts.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.460]   You got me started.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.460]   Which one do you like?
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.460]   Which one do you like?
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.820]   Anyway, any one of those.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:34.820]   Any of them.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.460]   These apparently spend a lot of time animating the bebes.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.780]   And I'm adding the bebes.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.780]   Let's see.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.780]   It's loading.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.780]   It's loading.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.780]   Yeah, it takes a second.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.780]   Oh, hey girl.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:45.780]   Aw.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   Hey girl.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.780]   Hey girl.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.780]   Hey girl.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   Aw.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.780]   I believe.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   Let's try another one.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.780]   We have it this--
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.780]   You're a little leaver.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:54.780]   Ooh.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   Love you like a love song, baby.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   Oh, no.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.300]   You even got like a little ghosting on that.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.780]   That's interlacing on that one.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   Ooh.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.780]   Ooh.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.780]   Ooh.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780]   I don't know where to go.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   I like the ones that add sort of cheesy--
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.780]   The same social.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   --cheesy graphics on top.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.660]   Yeah, this isn't moving.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   He's mine forever hot.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   I'd say this is the word.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.660]   Yeah, see that?
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.660]   That's cheesiness.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:19.660]   This is why--
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.140]   This is why God invented animated gifts right there.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.220]   It's like we don't need my space anymore.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.220]   We have Google Analytics.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   What?
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:34.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.220]   You love.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   Who needs Tiger Beat?
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.220]   We've got Google Image Search.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.220]   Yeah, it's not Tiger Beat.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.220]   It's not Tiger Beat.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.220]   Better be worried.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.220]   Whoo, yeah.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.220]   I can do Tiger Beat.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:49.220]   I just think of how many years I spent working on digital video for the net.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.220]   I know.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.220]   I mean, this is what you have wrought.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.220]   Thank you so much, Kevin Marks, for bringing this to us.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.700]   Well, no, the impressing part is we're still using animated gifts because it's still bloody
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.220]   hard to get video that works across platforms.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.220]   Right.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.220]   Because patents.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.220]   Right.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.220]   Patents.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.020]   You and I have to talk to you about something.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.220]   I want to know about the early days of quick time because you were there at the beginning,
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.220]   right?
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.220]   Yeah, I was there before it was public.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.220]   There you go.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.220]   I was on Apple, but I was in the seed before it went public.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   The New Galaxy Note 10.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.540]   We had a review yesterday on Before You Buy, Russell Tammany.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.500]   I saw one gorgeous screen.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.580]   Here's the new ad for the Nexus 10 titled New Baby.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.700]   So this would be a good one for you, Gina.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700]   Let's see.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:50.180]   What to expect when you're expecting?
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180]   Yes.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.980]   They're all using Google+.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.500]   We've got a little man on the way.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500]   What's his name?
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   Alfie Kevin.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500]   We're working on it.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.380]   It's barely the husband and wife don't actually live anywhere near each other.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.740]   But thank God there's Google+.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   Oh, no.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.740]   They're there together.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   One, six.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:09.020]   She's starting to show.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.300]   Softball league, childbirth classes, her choice.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.100]   Calendar, calendar collision.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.660]   Oh, the showers.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.620]   Her name is Kevin.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.620]   There's Mom.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.620]   Swollen ankles.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.620]   Remember that part?
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.620]   Oh, God.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.620]   Kevin.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.620]   And the man named Halcy.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.620]   Oh, man.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.620]   Oh, man.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.620]   Oh.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.620]   Oh.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.620]   Alvin.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.620]   They combined Kevin and Alfie.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.620]   And they named him after a chipmunk.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.620]   Holy mongolie.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.020]   But interesting that they were showing off user switching there.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:45.260]   So the mom had an account, the dad had an account, and then they had a family account.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260]   Oh, that was the point of it.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   That was the point of that ad.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.260]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260]   Thank God you were watching.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.260]   Well, you know, the tagline was the Nexus 10, the shareable tablet.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.620]   I mean, like the one tablet for the entire family, which is interesting.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.980]   I think it's a compelling feature just for that reason.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.420]   The tablet we have hanging around our living room, fighting about what we're going to
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.420]   name our kid.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.060]   And the price of the device is our baby shower.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.060]   Apple would disagree.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.060]   Apple would say, no.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.860]   As you said, Kevin, you can afford to have one for everybody.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.780]   Well, you can't with the Nexus.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.780]   Yeah, I can buy three Nexus 7s for the price of the iPhone.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   The price of the iPhone.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.780]   All right.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.940]   So, yeah, I'm not quite-- yeah, OK.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.500]   The Nexus 10 is like 400.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500]   Yeah, it's Apple.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   It's Apple price.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   That's always expensive.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.300]   Yeah, it's Apple price.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.500]   We did talk about Google Reader shutting down.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.580]   There have been petitions, hundreds of thousands of signatures.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.420]   Nobody's-- that's not going to change anything.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.860]   No, Leo, what did you think?
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.140]   I know Jeff was pretty upset about it.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   I saw Jeff ranting.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.060]   I was imagining the bumper of Jeff ranting on Twitter
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.500]   saying, you know, Google--
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.020]   Did they close Reader after the show?
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.260]   So we haven't talked about it.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:56.780]   They did.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   We have not.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   Oh.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780]   They closed it right after the show.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.780]   I think it was a Friday news.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.820]   It's kind of buried in one of their spring cleaning bullet
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:05.820]   points.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:06.820]   Did we talk about Andy Rubin?
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.420]   And it was narrated in the Pope.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.420]   We did.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.420]   OK.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.420]   You can talk about it anywhere.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.420]   I'm so confused.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.500]   So Andy Rubin was first, and then they killed Google Reader.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   And then--
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.540]   So 500,000 people sign up for Feedly.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.380]   I sign up for Feedly.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.980]   It is not a Google Reader replacement.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.060]   It's OK.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.140]   It's too pretty.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140]   Here it--
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.140]   Why not?
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.180]   It did import all my Google Reader content.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.100]   And so the one that I often do is tech news.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.420]   And so this is kind of Google Reader-like.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.220]   This looks very reader-y.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.420]   I guess it is.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.900]   There's old Reader.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.500]   That's the one that looks like Reader.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.100]   The old reader.com.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.980]   Oh, there's-- who's the old Reader.com?
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   Oh, the old Reader, yeah.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.980]   Is that it?
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.900]   This was made a while back when Google broke sharing.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.940]   If they'd, oh, you wouldn't share on plus, but does that
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.940]   do words?
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.980]   The old Reader said, well, we can recreate that.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.940]   So if you go there and import your subscription,
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.420]   it has the share-y stuff that we're used to have.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.500]   Now, can they scale up to accommodate all the unloved
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.620]   Google Reader users?
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.860]   That's the question.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.140]   Because there is some server side, quite a bit of server.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.940]   Is there not, Kevin?
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.300]   What's involved?
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.820]   What is the cost of running a Reader service?
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.740]   The challenge is the crawling.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.180]   And the reason that Reader sort of took over and became
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.860]   the central sync point for everyone
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.140]   was because Google does it as a side effect to them,
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.980]   their main web crawl, which means that they're
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.660]   crawling the entire web all the time anyway.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.460]   They've got very good knowing when things changed.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.980]   And so that is a lot easier than the classic feed updating
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.540]   problem.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.700]   So the feed updating problem is the point of the feed is,
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.940]   it gives you a list of the articles
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.100]   and you know when they've changed,
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.820]   but you still have to check the feed.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.260]   And so you have to go and check the feed every so often
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.020]   to see when it's updated.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.740]   And the way we used to do that was we had ping servers,
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:58.300]   so-called.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.340]   There was several of them.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.620]   Dave Winor ran one.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.780]   We ran one at Tech LaRati.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.620]   There was a couple of others.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.060]   I remember that, yeah.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.260]   And you would put those URLs of those
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.140]   into your blogging software, and it would poke that and say,
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.860]   I've just updated.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.740]   The problem with those became that they, you know,
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.620]   spammers would just ping them all the time.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:24.660]   So by the time Dave Winor sold the web log's one to Veracine,
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.300]   it was like 95% spam.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.100]   Because I was a technical writer at the time.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.860]   We would read all the firehoses from these ping servers
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.540]   and then run them through spam, fill us
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.820]   and decide which ones to make sense.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.620]   And it was very hard to get utility out of it.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.980]   So there was a spam problem with those.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.020]   So-- and then, you know, we were trying
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.860]   to build protocols for sharing stuff,
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.940]   you know, basically a sort of big shared ping server thing.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.780]   There's one that's plugged into WordPress that's not the name
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.940]   of that does a fairly good job of this.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.020]   And then there are also the big blogging platforms
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.780]   have their recently updated pages or feeds
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.660]   that you can plug into.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.580]   There are two or three ways of doing that as well.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.180]   You can also do it-- clients, I can't you
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.620]   with like a client app like Net News 1.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.620]   You can do it with a client app.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.220]   Yeah, that was the other way of doing it.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.140]   But the challenge of that is that you've then
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.220]   got lots of client apps hitting your blog all the time.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.580]   So you've got to pop in a blog.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.020]   Ah.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.780]   And you've got 100,000 readers.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.740]   You're getting 100,000 people calling you all the time.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.540]   So it's a hardship on the blog.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.300]   So it's a hardship on the blog.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.540]   And it's a hardship on your phone
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.140]   if it's pulling everything all the time like that too.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.700]   So there's value in doing it as a cloud site,
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.220]   a service, I think, in the cloud.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.900]   And there's also value in amortizing
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.180]   that crawl across lots of users, which Google was effectively
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.900]   doing, and also because they're crawling the whole web anyway,
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.580]   they were very good at telling when something
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.900]   could actually change.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.220]   It's quite hard to work out what's really going on
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.940]   because time zones, people have their clockset wrong,
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.740]   and people change something, and suddenly their entire feed
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.220]   gets republished, and a whole bunch of stuff like that happens.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.260]   So when I was doing the Tenoradi crawl,
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.420]   it was like, oh, look, this thing's in the future.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.220]   There's a common problem.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.060]   It's a very common problem.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.220]   You know the time you crawled it,
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.780]   but you don't know the time they published it.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.420]   And Google's crawl is big enough and comprehensive enough
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.140]   and not blocked by anyone, so they were very good at crawling
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.780]   everything.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.300]   So that effectively displaced the entire infrastructure there
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.260]   because they would let you tap into it.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.940]   And it wasn't a formal API.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.060]   It's a sort of undocumented back-end
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.420]   that lots of people use, and the team informally connected
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.220]   with them, but they never went through the official Google
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.460]   API process to put it out there, which means it's not going
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.180]   through the official deprecation process where they say
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.460]   when they'll turn it off.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.260]   It's just going to vanish when they turn the product off.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.980]   It seems like Google should keep this going
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.420]   if it only has a public service, right?
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.620]   That would be nice.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.580]   Not for an even for people who use Reader,
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.220]   but because it's doing this crawling anyway,
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.100]   it could really offload blogs.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.380]   Yeah, so there was this-- so there's
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.260]   a group that was formed called Open Access Coalition, which
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.100]   is semi-related to this, that Kevin Burton of Spinner
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.260]   and what's his face.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.780]   What's his face does so much these days?
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.140]   He's really too busy.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.940]   I think he should stop doing so many things.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:30.020]   Seems like he's doing almost everything nowadays,
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.020]   especially--
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.820]   So do you think they should keep the entire product running
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.820]   as a public service or just the unofficial API?
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.620]   I mean, since the API was totally unofficial, I don't know.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.940]   Greg-- sorry, Greg Kidd of Three Tabs.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.420]   So they've put this Open Access Coalition to all
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.300]   to fight for the ability for people to write web crawlers.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.420]   And this is an important issue.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.620]   The reason Google exists is because you can crawl the web
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.460]   and download the stuff and make sense of it.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.340]   And people don't restrict that.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.900]   A Neil wrote about this this week as well about,
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.580]   we should have weird user agents.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.700]   Because the user agent is-- the client-side app you use
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.900]   to connect to the web and make sense of it.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.900]   And a lot of sites are now saying,
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.140]   we will only let you connect to us if you're
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.180]   one of these known browsers.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.460]   Facebook does that now.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.380]   You can no longer--
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.620]   Really?
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.660]   If you try and curl a Facebook URL,
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.500]   it'll say you don't have a recognized browser.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.020]   Wow.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.820]   So this crawl ability has been reduced.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.540]   Also, people, you put a lot of stuff in their robots.txt
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.340]   that says only the Google bot can crawl me, which is tricky
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.260]   if you're Blacko or if you're Bing or somebody else
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.380]   trying to crawl them.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.820]   So yeah, there is a problem here.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.300]   Now, there are some other crawlers out there.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.540]   There's obviously Bing.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.700]   If Bing wanted to steal a march on Google,
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.300]   and say, we're now the Open Company, as Google's
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:59.860]   a closed company, they could say, we'll provide this API
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.980]   for people-- this what feeds have been updated
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.500]   and which ones have changed API for people
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.020]   as part of our crawl.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.820]   And it would probably help their crawl as well,
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.060]   because they would get-- then people
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.860]   will be motivated to plug things into them.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.060]   Open up.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.020]   Yeah, so I can see that if someone--
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:17.860]   Microsoft--
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.980]   --thinking about it.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.460]   Huge opportunity for Microsoft.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.980]   They're already crawling the web.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.940]   They're already doing it.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.420]   So it's just like you just write a map
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.340]   or introduce the stuff out to the sign,
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.780]   which is what all that happened at Google.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.980]   The reason that Reeder could be built by three guys at Google
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.820]   was because they could use the existing crawl.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.580]   Microsoft-- there's a guy right here who knows how to do that.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.060]   He'll write you a map reduce, no problem.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.820]   I understand how right my map reduce, but--
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.660]   He's probably done it a few times already.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.180]   Just take an old one.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.340]   So then the other thing there is,
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.060]   is there's this group called Common Crawl.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:57.820]   Common crawl.org, which is a crawl that dumps its data
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:00.140]   into an Amazon thing, and then you
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.900]   can run scripts against it.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.980]   So that's an interesting project.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.060]   I know I've seen Pete Warden has done some interesting stuff
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:08.620]   with that.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.260]   So the idea of that is it's supposed
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.740]   to be web crawl data that could be used to make sense of this.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.500]   So there's that.
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.420]   The other piece of this that could be valuable
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.860]   is Pub/Sub Hub Hub, if you remember that.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.460]   So Pub/Sub Hub Hub is designed for this problem
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   of what's updated web.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.780]   And the idea is you have a Pub/Sub Hub Hub server,
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.900]   and you publish your stuff to that, and people who want it
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:41.300]   subscribe to that server and say, call me when it's updated.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.100]   And there's a verification protocol
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.940]   to check that they are who they say they are,
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.740]   and they call that URL works.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.580]   So then you post your thing to there,
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.780]   and then it does the fan out of that to lots of--
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.380]   all the people are subscribed, and those are chainable.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:57.500]   So you could actually build Pub/Sub Hub networks.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.700]   So that was actually part of the reader infrastructure.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.220]   There's one that's hosted by Google that Brett Slack
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.540]   in built that's still running, and the feeder was plugged into.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.220]   I hope they'll keep that up as well.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:14.700]   So what's kind of happening is that somebody called it
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.860]   the breakup of the server union.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.060]   It's like all these old battles that
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.460]   were frozen when this thing take over are coming back again
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:21.960]   now.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.180]   So we have an interesting discussion
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:25.420]   in protocol space for the next few weeks
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.380]   as we try and put these together.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:31.420]   So in some ways, it's annoying that Google have done this.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.700]   It's very annoying that Google never did a proper API
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.300]   for it in the first place.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.780]   And we've got this weird reverse engineered thing.
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.820]   But we may be able to build something interesting
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.340]   and open out of this.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.620]   But that's my hope for a big chunk of this.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.140]   So to be clear, the fact that Feedly and I presume others,
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:53.900]   I'm looking at BazCucksBazqx.com that imports your OPML
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.420]   and gives you a very kind of Google Reader like interface.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.980]   And you mentioned the old read.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.460]   The fact that these companies do this isn't really a solution.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.500]   You don't want a million of these going around.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.820]   What you really want is a centralized repository.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.660]   Well, no.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.420]   It depends how they're doing it.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:18.740]   What you really want is to define a good API
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.380]   between the cache of all that's changed
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:26.940]   and the client-side app.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.940]   And at the moment, there's an API that was designed
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.980]   by a bunch of guys at Google for their particular purposes
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.460]   and who's being used by other apps for that.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.780]   It would make sense to spend a bit of time converging
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:42.340]   that together and saying, what is the good API between that?
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.820]   So that may be a conversation that's going on.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.860]   But the other part is, the other thing
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.700]   is that a lot of this infrastructure is
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.420]   as creaky as anything.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.540]   Feeds are messy things.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.540]   Most of them are invalid.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.980]   And you have to have a lot of--
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.140]   if you look at the universal feed passer, which
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.660]   is the best feed passer that I know about,
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:10.700]   it has something like 3,500 test cases
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.620]   that most of them are bad feeds and have a deal with them.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.260]   And they grew from finding bad feeds.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.940]   Can't feel where it's spent a big chunk of time
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.060]   getting that right and a lot of this stuff into that.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.620]   So the assumption that feeds are these beautiful things
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.500]   that work is actually--
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.260]   there's most of them are broken and there's
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.780]   a lot of fudging that sticks them together.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.620]   It's really a shame.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.900]   I mean, Google was doing the crawling.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.180]   Google had the code.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.380]   Wasn't much to maintain it.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.180]   I first thought, oh, this is a great opportunity
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.380]   for companies like Feedly.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.460]   Black Pixel, which owns Net Newswire, says, hey, good news.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.500]   We're working on new versions for the Mac, the iPhone,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.100]   and the iPad.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.500]   That was a great news reader on the Mac side.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.820]   So an opportunity for them, but really not really
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.100]   the ideal long-term solution.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.020]   Well, the challenge is--
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.180]   who's using this?
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.940]   The reason this is shut down is because those of us
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.820]   who are the text heavy web.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.780]   I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.300]   I have to think it has more to do with Google pushing Google
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:16.740]   plus than it does with the lack of use of the Google reader.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.540]   Same reason they took that share.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.820]   They haven't had that many users,
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.780]   but it's had lots of usage, if you see what I mean.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.260]   Right.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.780]   The people who use it use it intensively.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.540]   But it is those of us who read long-form text.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.500]   And that is, we're a small minority of the web these days.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.900]   So the question is, do we preserve
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.420]   this sort of long-form text parallel infrastructure,
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:45.180]   or do we try and merge it with the Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest,
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:50.140]   flow of millions of updates that are built on similar ideas,
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:54.180]   but with a very different sort of cadence of update?
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.100]   Dave Weiner himself said when you hear about this, well,
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.700]   you know, the inbox model is kind of out of date.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.820]   The news river model makes more sense.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.340]   That Twitter--
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.540]   Totally grew.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.500]   I've had really configured to be a river for a while.
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.340]   I mean, you can turn off the unread counts,
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.740]   and that makes it much less difficult.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.500]   And then you can decide which--
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.220]   you know, you can pick-- what it is,
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.660]   it's a sort of series of rivers.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.060]   You can put them in folders, and then you
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.540]   can get a river for each folder.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.540]   And that's the piece that I find used when I end up
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.300]   with one main one that I look at most of the time,
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.620]   and have some other ones that I'll check now and then.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.100]   And if you look, Facebook has just made--
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.940]   their redesign thing is kind of that.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.020]   They've got tabs that you switch between
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.140]   to see different rivers in there.
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.740]   And obviously, the various Twitter clients
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.580]   that give you columns that are now mostly owned by Twitter
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.060]   have that sort of worldview as well.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:57.580]   So there is some--
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.620]   I agree that the river is right when
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.740]   we are converging on that view.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.140]   But there is value in having these rarely updated ones
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.500]   that you look at as well.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:15.580]   Dave says in a conversation with Max Levchin on Twitter,
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:18.460]   he says, so it looks like there are three possible outcomes.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.740]   It's Dave, one of the instrumental guys in RSS.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.300]   He says, Google Reader's demise--
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.540]   one, Google Reader's demise is also the end of RSS.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.940]   He says, which seems to me is Google's desired outcome
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.660]   based on other things they've done.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.540]   Two, as market develops--
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.020]   or A-market develops, but we're unable to get the new features
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.860]   into it that simplify the subscription process
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.580]   so it has a chance, like Twitter.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.420]   Or three, a new dominant reader comes about.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.220]   And if they're good, then maybe something good happens.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.060]   He says, I don't think there's as slight as possibility
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.740]   of that number three happening.
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.860]   People in tech are too insular.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.460]   They don't study prior art or even study their competition
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.460]   enough to know where the problems are, much less
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.740]   where the potential solutions are.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.140]   I think more likely a mix between one and two
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.860]   continued decline for RSS and more and more reliance
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:09.060]   on big companies that couldn't care less, like Twitter.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.740]   That's depressing.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:14.020]   Yeah, that's a depressing outcome.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.020]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.300]   Dave Weiner's brought me on Twitter,
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.340]   so I can't read what he's tweeting,
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.300]   but I can still read this plot.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.700]   Good old Dave.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.100]   There is a difference of--
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.340]   I still see retweet sometimes.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:30.140]   But there is a difference between the centralization
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.900]   and the centralizing.
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.740]   And he's right.
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.300]   The stuff he built was decentralized.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.180]   It meant lots of us could build on it.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.380]   Again, Anita and I were reminiscing about this,
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.380]   but we were able to build these kind of things
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.460]   that had an interoperable layer.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:46.100]   And it was a lot beautiful interoperable,
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:46.780]   but it worked.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.740]   We could make it-- we could glue it together.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.820]   And the difficulty is that lots of the things that were built
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.980]   since were effectively blogging within one company.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:59.060]   So if you looked at-- even Delicious was like, oh,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.460]   it's a link blog except that the tags bridge across Delicious.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:01.980]   Isn't that nice?
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.300]   We've got a link there.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.420]   Tumblr is exactly that.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.660]   Tumblr is a blog with an update system
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.340]   that feeds inside itself so that you can repost things
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.820]   and they stay within Tumblr.
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:19.700]   And obviously, Twitter and Medium and the other things
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:23.420]   that are like this have those same characteristics, which
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:26.460]   is very easy for them to interrupt with themselves.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.940]   And it gets harder and harder to interrupt with each other.
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.860]   And one of the nice things about 10 years ago in blogging
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.460]   was that we had multiple mature clients that actually behave
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:39.540]   fairly well with each other, publishing things
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.620]   and reading things.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:45.100]   And that is the piece that's sort of being damaged
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.620]   by decentralization stuff.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:53.020]   And maybe this is a chance for us to try and rebuild that.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.500]   But I spent chunk of time trying to do this
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.700]   without consocial trying to make these feeds interoperate.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:58.860]   And it's hard.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.300]   It's hard to get companies to realize
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.500]   it's in their interest to do this, especially
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.980]   when they've got a large user base.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:12.420]   And they've got-- they like the ability to shut people down.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.100]   Facebook did it again this week.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:16.420]   Somebody got started building a successful messaging thing.
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.980]   And they said, oh, we shouldn't.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.140]   You down play.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.620]   They like that ability.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:25.940]   And to some extent, you need to be just shutting out spammers.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.780]   We did have a spam problem with blogs.
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.740]   There was a time when Blogger itself
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.900]   was a giant spam factory because it was very easy to set up
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.460]   scripts to generate blogs and post-post there
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.140]   and feed them into the rest of the infrastructure.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.780]   And it took a while for Google to realize that and clean that out.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:48.100]   So there are problems with this and how you plug this together.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.180]   It is hard to maintain who gets to talk to whom it is.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.460]   But we've come up with the following model.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.220]   And the subscription model actually does make some sense.
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:02.740]   And we've seen that idea spreading out into other places.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:05.260]   The challenge is, as I think as Dave was saying in that post
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.700]   you quoted, making that work in a way
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.220]   that bridges between the systems is the valuable piece
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:15.540]   and the piece that we need to spend some time doing an intro
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.540]   to the people.
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.540]   But you choose how you want to see it.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.140]   He also points out, he says, I never use Google Reader.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.540]   I didn't trust Google.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:26.540]   And he says, make sure if you're going to support something
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.540]   like this that it has a business model, you're paying for it
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:33.540]   so that there's some incentive for them to keep running it.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.540]   I mean, there's always a chance that a company who makes a thing
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.540]   you use is going to shut it down, right?
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.540]   I mean, whether it's free or not.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.540]   But I see Dave's point about the idea
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.540]   of publishing these feeds that are standard.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.540]   And you know, the blogs aren't going away.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.540]   You can export your OPML and take it elsewhere.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.260]   But when you're publishing within Twitter,
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.180]   within Facebook, within Google+, the whole publishing
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.740]   and sharing mechanism is all within that one product.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.540]   And what happens when they're shut down?
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.220]   There is an OPML to export.
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.220]   There's not-- right.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.860]   I mean, we see it happening, right?
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.020]   The Twitter API is shutting down.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.940]   In fact, they just tweeted that they're
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.540]   going to do a blackout test in five minutes.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.540]   So my Twitter client is not working in five minutes.
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.540]   What?
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.740]   Yeah, the blackout test for the API 1.0, right?
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.900]   Because they're rolling out API 1.1.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.540]   So they're doing a blackout test to see how the clients respond
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.540]   to this--
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.540]   To see who's still using 1.0.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.620]   And Kevin, yours is using 1.0.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.780]   You know that?
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.940]   Yeah, I'm an echofon.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:34.060]   So an echofon has been new by Twitter.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.900]   And so they haven't on the Mac.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.860]   They've still got an Android one.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.700]   And so they haven't moved it to 1.1.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.020]   So it will start for 10 at me in five minutes.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:47.060]   So I've got to go and watch it go and go inside myself
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.740]   and then try it again.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.980]   The other thing that's really reciprocating with this
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.780]   is all the feeds.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.500]   There are--
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.900]   Yeah, there are some feeds are gone.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.860]   For Twitter, those have been nuked.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.380]   The Adam feeds are gone.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.740]   They've all disappeared.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.660]   Because nobody cares.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.100]   Nobody really even thinks about this except we geeks.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:07.580]   That was the thing.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.500]   So I finally got my Twitter archive.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.380]   Let's you download the whole thing.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.300]   I was obviously late in the queue,
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.060]   because I had too many or something.
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:17.300]   And I downloaded it.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.740]   And then I was reading-- I thought, oh, what
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:22.300]   was I talking about in December?
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.060]   And I was talking about plugging Twitter into Technorati
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.620]   and how it looked like a blog and there was RSS feeds.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.500]   And I could probably blame it.
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.500]   And it was like, oh, yeah.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.380]   I don't remember when there was infrastructure for this.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.780]   But so that-- yeah, the other thing that strikes me
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.140]   is that at least being able to download that I can now
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.900]   upload that entire thing somewhere else.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.500]   And at least preserve that piece.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.540]   That is good.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:45.980]   But it loses the things I retweeted.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.140]   And it loses a lot of the connections between tweets
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:49.820]   that were there.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.540]   Because those-- if you download-- they sort of
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.060]   violate their own user interface guidelines.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.300]   If you embed a tweet in your page,
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.740]   you're supposed to use their magic JavaScript that will then
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:02.220]   show the thread of conversations.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.060]   But they don't do that with the archive one.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.820]   You have to click through to Twitter for that to show up.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.860]   And so that relies on the Twitter backend preserving that,
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:11.860]   too.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.340]   They actually give you a dump of what the current API looks
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:18.660]   like in JSON.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.820]   That's what the file looks like.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.900]   So the export is pretty good.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.860]   I don't know if you spent time on this playing with them, Gina.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:29.740]   But--
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.140]   Yeah, I have played with it.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.420]   I mean, the thing about the export is that you do it once.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.100]   And then that's it.
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.980]   But your tweet stream is kind of a living thing, right?
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.580]   You have to do it every single time.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.500]   It changes, right?
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.660]   And then what you said, it doesn't get related tweets
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:41.580]   or tweets that you retweet.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.340]   I mean, this is--
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.980]   obviously, I've done a lot of thinking about this.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.900]   But think up.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.740]   Because think up kind of gets everything.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.980]   All your links, all your friends, everything.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.860]   But Twitter--
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.460]   When you set up think up the first time,
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.500]   you could say, here's my archive.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.860]   And it could slurp that whole file in.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.260]   That would save you a lot of--
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.860]   We have one of our contributors is writing that code right now.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.540]   So yeah, you can pre-populate it.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.300]   But you're right.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.100]   When you don't get the related tweets, right?
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:09.060]   Like your mentions when you retweet something.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.700]   But Twitter isn't a tough spot, right?
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.740]   Like, what if you retweet something and then that gets deleted?
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.020]   Or someone mentions you or applies to you,
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.740]   but then they delete it.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:21.260]   It's for them to provide that data in the archive
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.820]   that can never be deleted, right?
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.020]   So they're only giving you your data back.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.820]   But the reality is that within a social context,
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.460]   your data is kind of inextricably connected
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.500]   to other people's data.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.220]   Because it's messages back and forth to one another.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.420]   So the difference between Gmail, Leo suddenly
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.220]   replied to Gmail.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.500]   He understands that he can't take that back or delete it,
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:40.660]   right?
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.980]   Because he has now put it in my inbox.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.820]   And I have a copy.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.900]   And I am entitled to that copy because it's a reply to me.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.860]   But that is not the case on Twitter.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:52.260]   So when the politician accidentally tweets a picture
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.260]   of his junk, he should be able to delete that.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.980]   And clients are all supposed to respect the fact
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.420]   that it has been deleted and deleted on their side as well.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.820]   The cash copy should be deleted.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:02.140]   That's part of Twitter's terms of service.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.140]   Interesting.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.820]   Which is--
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:09.020]   Does that mean think up has to delete it?
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.180]   Yeah, think up deletes.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.180]   Think up looks for deletes.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.580]   And it's terribly inefficient.
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.420]   But yeah, we check for deletes because it's just part of--
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.700]   You have to pull for deletes?
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.340]   You can't-- it doesn't push you deletes.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:18.820]   Yes.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:19.740]   It does not push deletes.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.940]   We have to pull for--
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.540]   It's terribly inefficient.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.380]   That's bizarre.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:27.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:28.180]   Well, OK.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.460]   If you're not depressed enough now,
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.780]   let's talk about Google pulling ad blocking apps
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:38.860]   from the Play Store because it violates developer agreement.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:40.900]   So adblock plus, adblocker, addaway,
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.420]   and adfree no longer downloaded from the Play Store.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.980]   I guess that's not surprising since Google's business is,
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.820]   in fact, ads.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.580]   Ads.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.740]   I mean, this seems pretty straightforward to me.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.820]   We talked about this on all about Android last night.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.380]   I mean, there's a section in the Google Play user developer
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.020]   agreement that you agree not to upload apps that are going
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.260]   to interfere with third party services, right?
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.940]   And that's what ad blocking apps do.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.900]   I saw a lot of people really upset about this,
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:06.940]   feeling like Google was lowering the hammer,
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.140]   and they were being controlling, and they have the right
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.300]   to run whatever they want on their phones.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.420]   And that may be the case.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.900]   But there's lots of ways you can get an APK onto your phone.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.700]   It doesn't have to happen through the Play Store.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.580]   I truly didn't have a problem with it.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.540]   I thought it made sense.
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.620]   And you agree to those terms when you upload an app
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:26.820]   to the Play Store.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.900]   I don't know if you listened to security now before this show,
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:34.620]   but Steve kind of blew us all away with a piece written
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:39.020]   by an anonymous hacker and posted on Bitbucket.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.300]   The guy is, I'm sure, going to try to preserve his anonymity.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.980]   Because what he did is he wrote a distributed port scanner
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.820]   that scanned every internet address,
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:53.500]   looking for a variety of things, but most importantly,
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.140]   looking for open telnet ports.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:00.060]   Once he found them, he tried logging in using generic root
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:04.220]   logins like Root Root or Blank Blank or Admin Root,
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.460]   that kind of thing.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:11.820]   And he was able to create a botnet of 420,000 clients
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:15.500]   all over the world that he totally owned.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:19.420]   Some of these are appliances, things like Hewlett-Packard
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.900]   printers sitting on the open internet.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.180]   And once he created that botnet, he continued the scans.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.980]   He was able to scan pretty much the entire internet.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:32.740]   And what's just shocking is the number of computers, many
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:36.740]   of them running Linux, openly accepting telnet requests
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.620]   without secure telnet passwords completely
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:45.340]   available for use by bad guys in all sorts of de-dossing
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:47.900]   and so forth.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.820]   Just kind of an amazing story.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:52.300]   We'll put the link in the show notes.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.900]   You could search for the internet census 2012.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.140]   Bitbucket.org.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.340]   Well, the interesting thing is the image he built of the--
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.340]   which addresses are actually in use.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:12.900]   Which has these big black areas in there, which are IP address--
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.580]   slash 8s that companies got a long time ago
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:18.340]   and are not actually using, including Apple and Ford
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.100]   and Merck and a whole bunch of others.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.940]   So the top left corner of the graph
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.540]   is all these black unused IP addresses that--
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.180]   now arguably they're using them to root internally.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:33.660]   And maybe they have got that many computers.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:37.180]   But I suspect it's slightly unlikely for some of them.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.900]   And it might be nice if they could release some of those.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:44.500]   Let's not, because if we moved IPv6, all of this goes away.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.220]   But that's the real fix.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:50.580]   But that was the thing that the chart was that was interesting
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:51.900]   for me was him showing that.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.380]   All the unused IP addresses.
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.820]   The IP address space exhaust.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.180]   But yes, but most of these aren't publicly advertised.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.140]   So they've been used inside firewalls
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.700]   where you could use more easily set up IPv6
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.460]   or you could do a giant gnat.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.660]   Not that one's fun too.
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:10.060]   This is an animated GIF that shows ping requests
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.180]   as they go across the world and that even
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.700]   has the Terminator line.
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.300]   So you could see day night and so forth.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.020]   That's a fun one.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.180]   But that's not really--
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:21.180]   The square one.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:23.980]   The square one, that's it.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.020]   You have to sort of look at it and probably
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.300]   we'll just say it on the screen.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.340]   But if you look at the link, each of the boxes
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.380]   is a class A address, a slash A address.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.540]   So many of them are dark.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.780]   Now the two in the top right are the reserved ones.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:44.740]   One's for multicast and one's for the local reading one.
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:48.140]   And then the ones that have lit up
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.540]   are where there are actually active things
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.220]   that they found by crawling.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:53.140]   And if you go--
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.100]   There's another one that--
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.380]   Some of these dark ones--
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.180]   I mean, some of the dark ones are just--
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.540]   they're not accepting ICMP ping requests.
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:08.620]   But those big black blocks are obviously
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.660]   whole ranges that are out of use.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:15.580]   So the top left corner, if you actually
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:19.940]   look at the allocation map, there's an XKCD cartoon of it.
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:21.740]   But you can actually see the names of-- not in this one,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:23.900]   but in the other somewhere else on the page.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.620]   You can see the names of the companies that own entire
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.460]   slash A addresses, including Apple.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.420]   And it is a list of companies that
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:34.060]   were big a long time ago, because when they were allocated--
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.060]   Right.
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:35.900]   Right, right.
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:37.620]   --for has an entire slash A, which
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.620]   is unless they're actually putting one per car,
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.100]   that seems excessive.
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:50.580]   So you're not too worried about the threat of massive DDoS
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.100]   attacks and--
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.540]   Well, there's the XKCD.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.980]   There's the XKCD.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:58.580]   That's actually-- all the bits that are actually green there
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.340]   have now been allocated.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.940]   But if you look at the top left-hand corner,
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:04.780]   there's a whole bunch of companies that have HP and deck
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:10.740]   and IBM and MIT and Apple and Fella, Zeros.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.940]   That's awesome.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.700]   On the net at the time, and grabbed it
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.460]   and tried chunk of address space.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.420]   Also, the amount we got for multicast is slightly excessive.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:20.820]   And nobody uses that anymore, do they?
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.340]   Well, it's hard to.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.700]   Nobody roots it very well.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.500]   Was it M-bone?
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.260]   Was it the M-bone and stuff like that?
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.220]   It was M-bone.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.020]   But David Cheriton grabbed a huge chunk of that
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:32.580]   with some idea about using it for file distribution.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.940]   That's so funny.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.980]   It's mostly empty, which is a shame.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:38.020]   It could be used for a bit more.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.740]   But--
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.180]   So yeah, there's a--
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.300]   anyway, what was I getting at with that?
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.340]   So the point about the botnets is
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:49.180]   that they managed to build this botnet that would do this
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.620]   and do this benign thing.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.220]   But it makes it pretty clear how easy it is
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.620]   to construct botnets.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.100]   If these guys can do--
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.580]   These guys, it was one-time.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.700]   He can do this and publish this and say, this is how I didn't.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.260]   And this is what's going on.
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.300]   It is pretty clear that other people are doing this
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.900]   and they're not being quite so subtle about it.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.500]   Fascinating.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.060]   I don't know what to say about it.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.260]   We're going to take a break.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.980]   When we come back, we will get your--
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:18.380]   you got a new thing, a new number, new something?
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.540]   I'll give you a moment to come up with Kevin Marks.
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.140]   Gene is tip.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.180]   I'll have a tool.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:25.060]   But first, a reminder that if you're not backing up,
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.540]   now's the time to do it with carbonite.com.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.020]   Carbonite online backup is everything
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.060]   you need from a great backup service.
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.260]   It's automatic so you don't have to remember it.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.140]   It's continuous, so when you change a file,
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.700]   it's automatically backed up.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.580]   And it's in the cloud.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.540]   So even if the worst happens, fire, flood, tornado,
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.420]   somebody steals all your stuff, you still
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.300]   got a copy of all that precious data.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:50.780]   And all of this $59 a year per computer, less than $5 a month.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.500]   And by the way, it includes cloud storage.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.740]   So you can log on to your carbonite account on any computer
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.020]   or use their free apps.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:56.780]   And there's your stuff.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:57.980]   You can download it, use it.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.580]   It's really a nice tool.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.660]   I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.340]   Carbonite.com from financials to family photos.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:09.460]   Carbonite keeps what's important to you safe.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:12.340]   And that's a real piece of mind for $59 a year.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.140]   If you use our offer code TWIG, you
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.260]   could try it free for two weeks.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.540]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:21.060]   And you'll get 14 months when you buy an extra two free months.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.900]   Carbonite.com.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:23.940]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.020]   If you're not backing up, get going.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:29.100]   Back it up to get it back with carbonite.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:32.540]   Gina Trappane, your tool of the week.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.780]   So basically, my tip of the week, I pretty much never
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.180]   print out email.
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:38.540]   No one prints stuff out anymore.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.860]   But I do once a year when I do my taxes.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.780]   Because all year long, I file expenses
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.700]   into a certain Gmail label.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.180]   Proceeds for expenses that I stuff that I buy online.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:48.700]   So I was doing them.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.060]   I couldn't put it together in my taxes.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.780]   And I had this problem where I had to print out
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:55.100]   all the messages within a particular Gmail label,
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.180]   the label for my itemized deductions.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:05.060]   And I found this Chrome app called Gmail Print All.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.740]   So if you're in this situation where you just
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.700]   need to print out an entire label or just archive it
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.860]   to one single giant PDF file, you can do this.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.180]   Gmail Print All for Chrome, you launch the app,
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.460]   you give it access to your Gmail.
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.580]   I basically just gave it access to do my print job.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:19.940]   And then I revoked access.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.820]   And it will just take all the messages
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.500]   within a particular label and either print them out
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.420]   or output them to PDF.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:28.660]   Like I said, probably announce something you have to do very
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.620]   often, but it saved me a ton of time when I was getting my stuff
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.820]   ready for my accountant this year.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.020]   So maybe it'll help you out, too.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.300]   Now I hope you printed a PDF and you sent your accountant
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.020]   to the PDF.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.220]   You gave him a stack of paper?
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:42.180]   No, I didn't even say-- well, I have
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.940]   to go through this stack of paper, make a spreadsheet,
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:45.580]   and then I just send him the final number.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:46.660]   He doesn't want the receipts.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.700]   He just wants the totals.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.900]   But I liked it because I'm crazy.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:49.940]   I like to keep a hard copy.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.900]   But yeah, I do have a PDF just in my hard drive
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.260]   that I back up to my regular backup sources as well.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.100]   Right.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:57.660]   Do you use Google--
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.340]   Or redundancy.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.100]   Do you use Google Print ever?
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:01.540]   I haven't.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.380]   Cloud Print, you mean--
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.020]   Cloud Print.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.420]   I love it.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.460]   Yeah, I have it.
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:04.900]   Do you?
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:05.180]   Really?
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.380]   Yeah, well, it turned out I didn't know this.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.020]   But I have an Epson Worksforce printer that's
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.740]   Cloud Print Aware.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.580]   So I turn it on.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:12.220]   And it's just kind of cool that you
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.980]   can print from anywhere to--
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:14.500]   To the office.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:15.820]   To my home.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:16.740]   Oh, and so--
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:17.740]   I go home and then I get to--
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:18.180]   I go home and then I get to the office.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:19.300]   Well, I can do it at the office, too.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.420]   We have one at the office, too.
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:23.900]   You can also do stuff where, as long as you're logged in
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:29.340]   to Chrome, even if you don't have to have a special printer,
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.820]   as long as Chrome's open on the computer
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:33.820]   and the computer's connected to the printer,
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.780]   you can print to that printer.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.620]   Oh, you mean if you have another computer connected
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.020]   to a printer and you're logged--
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:40.500]   Oh.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:43.100]   At home, I have my desktop PC.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.580]   And that has a printer attached to it.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.060]   From anywhere, as long as I'm printing via Chrome,
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:52.140]   I can print to that printer at home.
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:54.300]   And no special software.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.220]   The computer has to be sort of awake and Chrome
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:56.940]   has to be launched on.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.440]   Right.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.100]   So it has to be powered on.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.180]   Not only does Chrome have to be opened,
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.580]   but it has to be signed in to whatever Google account I'm using.
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.340]   Just set up Google.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.500]   Grab print if you have a printer that supports that.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.460]   That's really nice.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:11.540]   Or print to any FedEx office.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:12.500]   Which is kind of weird.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.740]   Yeah, it's in right here in the cloud print settings.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.340]   Print to FedEx office.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.980]   So I have that printer at work.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:19.340]   I have my printer at home.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:21.500]   Or I can print to a FedEx office.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.380]   See, I need a printer in my accountant's office.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:25.780]   So I can just send my phone and my huge giant video.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.660]   And you have to send his office.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:28.060]   And you sort through my receipts.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:28.540]   Thanks.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:29.540]   Exactly.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.460]   It's pretty-- cloud print is pretty amazing.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:31.980]   I really like it.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.740]   I can try to send this up with my mom's house
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.460]   when I was over there.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.300]   But she keeps unplugging to print from pretty in the comments.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.060]   I didn't really.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:38.580]   OK.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.260]   That's one thing.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:42.540]   You have to have a network-enabled printer that's plugged in.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.460]   Not in a cupboard.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.980]   She only gets the sandwich.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:46.740]   She needs to print things.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.820]   Which I'm thinking, oh, I can send her little printed things.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:50.900]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.180]   You can send her mail, snail mail.
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.780]   But it's really coming out of her printer.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.580]   And I think, you know, I was surprised.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:00.340]   I didn't know my-- I have a workforce pro.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.500]   I didn't know it was Google Cloud Print.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.580]   I just thought-- and the way you find out
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.780]   is you actually find out what the IP address of your network
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:07.660]   printer is, and you surf to it.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:09.820]   And if you have settings, it'll turn it.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:12.780]   You can turn on Cloud Print, which is kind of cool.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.500]   So worth checking out.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.140]   Did you come up with an alternative number?
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.740]   Kevin, I've stalled.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.060]   All I can have.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.100]   Well, my number was what I said earlier, which is 83% of
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:25.260]   frowns now support SVG, which is more than 80% of the
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.380]   score flash.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.860]   I think that's pretty significant.
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:31.300]   And the take-home from that is make sure that if you build
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.660]   something that lets you upload images, it lets you upload
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:38.940]   SVG too, because that is going to be more useful.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.620]   So if you're not sure SVG is, SVG is a vector format for
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.180]   images.
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.780]   So you can do something as a series of lines, and then you
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:49.900]   can make it as big or small as you like, and it'll still look
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.900]   good, and you don't have to have lots of versions.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.340]   And the reason this is getting more and more useful is that
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.980]   we now have screens that vary a number of pixels by several
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:00.420]   orders of magnitude.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.500]   And so web designers are going, oh, god, I've got to put
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.460]   different size images in for all these retina users.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.140]   And there's people who've got really big Chromebooks with
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:09.780]   lots of pixels.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.980]   So that's--
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.140]   Not that, not that, Chad, what I've got.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.580]   That's something later coming up.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.380]   There you go.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.260]   So all the current versions of IE Firefox Chrome Safari Opera,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.540]   iOS Safari Opera, Mini Android, and Blackberry browsers all
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.780]   support SVG, which is great.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:30.300]   So it's time has come, which means that if you're--
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.900]   and these are none of them that support Flash has been going
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.260]   down, whether it's SV is going up, and I think they've just
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.540]   about crossed, which means that if you're thinking about, oh,
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.020]   I should generate something in a vector format, Flash is
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:42.980]   no longer the way to go.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:45.260]   Is there a tool that you recommend for creating a
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:48.420]   scalable vector graphics SVG?
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.420]   The Google drawing thing that's in docs will actually do it
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.260]   fairly easily.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.780]   If you watch this one, a cloud-based one, it'll save as SVG.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.900]   Illustrator saves as SVG if you're already using Illustrator.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:01.260]   And there's what's it called?
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.540]   Ink Space.
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:03.100]   Inkscape.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:03.540]   Inkscape.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:04.380]   Inkscape.
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:04.820]   That's it.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.580]   I was just saying, "Inglot."
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:06.900]   Inkscape, which is a--
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:09.820]   It's an open source illustrator, basically.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.180]   It's an open source illustrator, but it has--
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.940]   it uses X-Windows, so it's a bit weird.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.860]   But the other thing is you can generate it programmatically.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:21.020]   If you're running something that generates code, running it
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.580]   in code, running it's generate SVG is actually a pretty
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.580]   smart idea, because they tend to be a lot.
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.900]   That would be more like a Flash animation or something
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:30.300]   like that.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:30.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:36.580]   Another tip there is if you go to Wikipedia, the Wikipedia
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.260]   image cache thing, they're starting to gather useful art in
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.940]   SVG, like company logos and things.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.780]   Ah.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:46.100]   They're getting people to either upload them or make them
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.900]   and put them there.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.140]   So there are resources for this, too.
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.700]   So that was my--
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.860]   We have an Illustrator version of our logo.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.500]   We should probably make an SVG version.
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.660]   Yeah, you should make an SVG one.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.140]   I think they're available.
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:56.140]   Available.
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:57.140]   I think they're available.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:02.820]   Because it will actually-- the big point of this is it
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.660]   works on all the phones.
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.020]   It works on all the phones, all the tablets.
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.420]   And it's very lightweight.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.140]   And it's very-- yeah.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:09.580]   Yes.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.980]   I had an Apple one.
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.420]   Well, I've loaded it to my keyboard.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.380]   It shouldn't actually work now.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.700]   So we've got the original Apple logo on Wikipedia.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:23.020]   Hang on.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.580]   I'll stick that somewhere in the chat table.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:29.140]   It's tiny.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:30.140]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:30.740]   It's a tiny part.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.500]   But it's scalable.
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.180]   So it can look--
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:32.700]   It's scalable.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.140]   So it's draw a half the size.
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.300]   And the shape was the same.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.140]   Look at that.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:36.700]   Beautiful.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.700]   Of course, you can't use that anymore because it's the
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:39.700]   old rainbow logo.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   Right.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:44.340]   But that was nicer than the current logo.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:45.980]   But the point is you can do quite
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.860]   complicated vector things.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.020]   And you can zoom them arbitrarily.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.100]   And they'll work everywhere.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:54.020]   And they're smaller than a gift for that size.
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:57.340]   No, they can be smaller than a ping for when you start doing
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.260]   retinoscopy things.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:01.580]   So that's my nerdy tip.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:05.940]   The other tip I had, which was a link, is I went to Google
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.940]   DevFest, which was a developer conference they
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.140]   ran last week.
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:15.020]   And there was a great talk by Kit Hodsden.
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:19.780]   And it's at ki.t/devfest, which was her--
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:24.380]   automate all the things to talk, which is basically very
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:27.140]   much a sort of life hack for a nurse thing about how you
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:33.220]   should be using the command line and cron jobs and all
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:36.900]   these sort of tools and tricks.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.260]   This is the original life hack.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.580]   It was the philosophy.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.340]   Yeah, use cron jobs.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.540]   Come on.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:45.300]   Come be lazy.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.780]   But it was very nerdy.
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:47.980]   But I really enjoyed the talk.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.780]   And she had a bunch of ideas that I hadn't heard that.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.620]   I like that quote, though.
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:51.620]   You hear back?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.100]   The line quote.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:53.980]   And line quote.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.020]   Progress isn't made by early risers.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.100]   It's made by lazy men trying to find easier ways
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.340]   to do something.
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:01.620]   I'd agree with that.
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.980]   And there's a huge list of links and resources there.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:06.500]   So I'm sure there'll be a video of the talk up.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.220]   But it was one of those talks where I was like, that's
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.380]   really cool.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.380]   And it reminded me of that.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.580]   I would agree, too.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.300]   I would agree.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.780]   Everything from command launchers like Alfred and
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:23.980]   launchy to command line scripts from Bash, Flickr uploader,
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:29.100]   Trovebox, alias.s.ace, alias.sh, great site.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.900]   I love collecting these things.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:31.860]   These are great.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.060]   I love them.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.260]   Gina's right in there with the to do that.
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.660]   Yeah, this is what made me do life hack,
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.020]   where I was like, the little life hack talk was really about
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:41.220]   this.
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.820]   It was about using dash scripts and keeping everything in
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.500]   plain text and using Quicksilver.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.180]   And yeah, I mean, to do text was really kind of worn out of
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.940]   this kind of ethos.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.940]   I wish.
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:52.740]   I love this stuff.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.940]   They always said this about George Moro, who wrote the
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:55.540]   Moro computer.
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:56.900]   He wouldn't buy off the shelf software.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.380]   He just write everything himself.
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:02.220]   I wish I had the time just to automate everything and live
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.220]   in the terminal.
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:07.220]   I probably use E-Max and code and Lisp.
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:09.220]   I'd wear a beret.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.220]   I'd wear a beret.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.220]   Wear a beret.
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.220]   He'd dream tea.
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.220]   Drink tea.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:18.220]   And be very cranky if anybody bothered me.
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.220]   Gina Trapani, you can only make me smile.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.220]   Gina Trapani is in Brooklyn.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.220]   It's OK.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:25.220]   She joined us.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:28.220]   She is the founding editor of Life Hacker.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:31.220]   So there, the creator of to do.text.
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:35.820]   She is also the author of Think Up, although many now work on
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.820]   it.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.820]   Think Up App at ThinkUp.com.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   Yes.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.820]   Great show today.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.220]   We miss Jeff, but great show.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.220]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.220]   Always fun.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:45.620]   Boy, it couldn't have been a better time to get Kevin
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:48.220]   Marks on because I forgot all about Technorati.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:51.220]   You did all this reader RSS stuff.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.220]   You're the prototype for all of this stuff.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.220]   And the trenches.
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.220]   Man, the trenches.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.220]   So nice to have you.
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.220]   Spend a chunk of time trying to understand this stuff a long
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:00.220]   time ago.
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:02.220]   Really quick.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.220]   And I'm so glad I keep launched before the show rather than
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.220]   after the show.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:07.220]   Someone on Twitter had said, hey, you guys didn't talk about
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:09.220]   the implications of Keep on Google Glass and that which I
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.220]   thought was very--
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.220]   Oh.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:14.220]   Of course, Glass would be an input device, wouldn't it, for
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:15.220]   Keep?
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.220]   OK, Glass, keep this.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.220]   Keep this.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.220]   Keep this.
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.220]   That's all you have to say.
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:21.220]   Keep this.
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.220]   Glass, keep this.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:23.220]   Keep this.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.220]   Mm-hmm.
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.220]   Mm-hmm.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.220]   Now I want it.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:29.220]   What's going to arrive first?
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:32.220]   Your Pixel or your Explorer edition glasses?
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.220]   Ooh, I want both.
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:36.220]   So nothing-- no words gone out about the Explorer edition,
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.220]   right?
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.220]   That's just since--
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.220]   I haven't heard a thing.
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:40.220]   Yep.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.220]   Yep.
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:42.220]   All right, guys.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:43.220]   Thank you.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.220]   Kevin Marks anywhere you want to plug--
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.220]   tellmovision.tv.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:48.220]   You're looking for a producer if you want to help Kevin and
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:50.220]   Heather and everybody get that show back.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.220]   Deborah, get that show back on track.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.220]   That'll be fun.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:47:00.220]   Tellmovision.tv.
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:03.220]   Also, want to plug Salesforce Chatter for Android and iOS,
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:04.220]   which was updated this week.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.220]   And so if you're a Salesforce user, you should check that out
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:10.220]   because it added the-- the classic chatter is still there,
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:13.220]   but it's also got the ability to upload different kinds of
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.220]   records and create them and view them in it.
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:17.220]   So it's actually quite a significant improvement.
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.220]   Fantastic.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:21.220]   That's salesforce.com.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.220]   Right on.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.220]   Kevin, you bring the dirty birds' chirping to the show, as well.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:28.220]   Yeah, tweet tweets.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.220]   Those are--
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.220]   Tweet tweets.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   Those are pat--
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.220]   Those tweets are patented now.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.220]   You can't--
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:34.220]   We're going to get a takedown for sure.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:35.220]   Kevin Marks in his garden.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:38.220]   And by the way, he lives in an orange grove, apparently.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.220]   Those look--
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.220]   Yeah, it's a beautiful orange, jade.
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:44.220]   It's kind of a full orange grove, yeah.
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:45.220]   That's where--
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:47.220]   You know, that's how my parents got me to move to California.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.220]   They said, "We'll be able to walk out on our back porch and
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220]   pick an orange and juice it for breakfast."
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.220]   Yeah, that, seriously.
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:55.220]   It's so California.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.220]   [laughter]
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.220]   That blew my mind.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:58.220]   I moved here from Brooklyn.
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:01.220]   I was like, "You mean you can just pick an avocado off of
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.220]   a truff-a-tru, that's insanity."
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.220]   Amazing.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.220]   There's avocados on the ground and oranges.
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:09.220]   It is the rocket's land.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:10.220]   Definitely got oranges.
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.220]   It is.
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.220]   Thank you, guys.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.220]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.220]   We do twig at 1 p.m.
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.220]   Pacific 4 p.m.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.220]   Eastern time.
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:20.220]   That would be 2,000 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:21.220]   Watch Live.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:25.220]   Love it if you can chat and be part of the show.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:29.220]   But if you can't, we make on-demand versions available after the fact.
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:33.220]   Twig.tv/twig and wherever you find fine internet broadcasts,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:38.220]   aggregated and served up via RSS.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.220]   There's an orange.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:40.220]   Look, he picked one.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.220]   Is that an annoying orange?
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:45.220]   [laughter]
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:49.220]   Only if you're in the snow and on the east coast right now.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:52.220]   Jim, you went back east just the time for a snowstorm.
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.220]   Oh, man.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.220]   I was like, "Oh, I got a pack of winter coat."
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.220]   Guys kind of just rambled in my house before I left.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.220]   It was like 80 degrees this evening, the other day.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:01.220]   Yeah, nope, nope.
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.220]   Yeah, not here.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.220]   Time to travel.
[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:08.220]   I guess that's all there is to say.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.220]   But we'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.220]   Bring your oranges.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:21.220]   [music]
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.640]   (soft music)
