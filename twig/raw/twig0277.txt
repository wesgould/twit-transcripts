[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.320]   Down vest and he's got a Nexus 6 in his hot little hands
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.360]   Hey Jeff
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.520]   Hey there. Good to see you. Great to have you wait Jeff's going to a show. So we're gonna
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.800]   Make this make this show on not short, but on time today

[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.000]   But uh, no somewhere else but I remember yeah
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.160]   Somewhere in a flyover state, I believe
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.800]   Love to all fly over safety all fly over
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.160]   Germany's a flyover state to Jeff also joining us from giga home. He's in Canada Matthew Ingram
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.920]   Good to have you welcome you are wearing a San Francisco t-shirt. So that's good
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.100]   What's that we just blew apparently the default transition is an explosion
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:11.040]   Well, you know what it's appropriate because we've been talking about deconstructing the media but in the before the
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.840]   Show began and I'm sure we'll talk a little bit about that this show normally is about well
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.240]   Actually nominally is about Google and the cloud, but it's normally about whatever we want to talk about and since
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.280]   We have great journalists here. It's always the case that we kind of talk about journalism a little bit actually
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   Let's kick things off with contributor
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   Which is an interesting plan that Google has for removing ads from some blogs for a fee and
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.000]   I I have to feel like this is an experiment
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.280]   What is going on Jeff? I don't so the idea is
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.760]   Between one and three dollars a month and certain sites onion the onion mashable
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.920]   In an imager wiki how I don't know where they why they picked these
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.000]   Will we'll get the chance to remove ads put them a pixel pattern in a place? Yeah
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah, I talked to a Google person about this
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   before a launch and
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.140]   She said they chose
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.720]   sites that don't get a huge amount of traffic because they wanted to sort of experiment and iterate and I said well
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.920]   Why would you pick mashable then it gets like 50 million unique visitors a month or something?
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.720]   But I guess they wanted to pick one big one and then a bunch of smaller ones actually imager gets quite a lot of traffic too
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.520]   but
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.640]   It feels to me like just another one of those kind of experiments that they're trying to sort of you know to help publishers out a bit
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   And I'm assuming they realize that for lots of smaller publishers
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   Adsense basically is chicken feed and so I assume they're trying to think of some new ways for
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   To help them out it. I don't feel like I think it's it's a noble gesture and it's kind of a tip jar
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.060]   Sort of model. I just I don't really see a whole lot of people
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.960]   Doing it. I I think it's a stop. I think that you know you've seen Google and
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.720]   You know god bless them trying to do things but but I think the things they've tried to do are are trivial
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.760]   They've tried to do micro papers before I don't believe in micro papers
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   They tried to help people rethink the story that didn't work very well
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.160]   And now they're doing this this is not gonna be a salvation
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.440]   Google should bring it's best bring best strategy its best technologist this effort if they care about news
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   I was at newsgeist
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I didn't mention a week ago
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.520]   And we have session on what what should Google do what could Google do for news
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.360]   And there are bigger strategic things they could enable embeddable articles they could
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   Hard to pavement streams. There's all kinds of other things they could do. This is cute
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.680]   But a distraction not really worth the effort. I don't think
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.400]   One if you combine this with the google music key the move to
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.200]   Allow people to pay for youtube music videos and remove the ads
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.640]   Is that a completely unrelated thing? No, it's no way to get strategy, but I don't
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.520]   I think it might be a response though to people who say
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.760]   And and a lot of people say this including google competitors
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.320]   Um, well google just is using you know, you're the product
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.440]   um, and so
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.200]   Is it could this be google's way of saying well, what if we try try it so that you're not the product
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.360]   I think readers put up or shut up
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.200]   If you keep complaining that okay you you could you could want to be the product you don't want to see anymore
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.760]   That's you. What do you think?
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.160]   I think it is a bit of I mean, maybe
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.200]   SOP is a little it's a little harsh, but I do think you know, it's another one of those kind of little
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.800]   Experiments they try like the the survey wall where you know, you instead of having a paywall
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.600]   You could ask people to answer a few questions that apparently lots of sites are using it
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.800]   um
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   Whether they're
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.720]   Generating a lot of revenue or not. I I don't know I doubt it, but I still
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.400]   In a way, it's worthwhile. I mean, I don't see why
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.120]   I kind of like the fact that they're
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.720]   At least experimenting with this stuff. This feels very much like what
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.040]   Readability tried to do when they although they went about it in a completely different way, but they tried to do kind of
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.800]   micro
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.640]   Tip jar style payments didn't work google at least has the skill that it could theoretically do
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   That it's to me. I don't know whether it's up. No, this is not even if this works
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.840]   Beyond everyone's wildest imagination is successful. It is no salvation
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.720]   Um, I look back to say that what google should be doing. I think is bringing
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.400]   Uh, if they care about news, they can say listen. We don't care about news. Don't give a damn
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.080]   What happens happens?
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.800]   But but that's not what they you know, they they hold news guys there in trouble with publishers and jury which we'll talk about later
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.120]   They do care to some extent and I think they got to bring their best brains here and and minor ways to help them use google
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.680]   Functionality better or to create
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.280]   Um things like this. I just don't think of the our brain full google horsepower to this question
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.600]   Well, and if i'm a one of these sites what I might do is just say well
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.120]   I could also just crowdfund go to patreon or somewhere
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.200]   Yeah, and control my destiny get rid of google ads if that's what my readers want. I could do that
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   And you make more money when you google at google ad you don't make much in ad sense
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.880]   No
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.280]   And you're not going to make much on contributor, but at the same time I do sort of feel like
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.000]   You know, they take they get a lot of crap for stuff. They do and at least they're trying
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   the
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.360]   Trying to find new ways to help publishers who don't want to
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.200]   You know just do crowdfunding or don't want can't run their own paywall because they don't have the
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   You know, they don't have the manpower of the resources
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.480]   Um, but it's probably not I agree with jeff
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.320]   It's not going to amount to much at the end of the day is youtube music key some that seems to be something a little bit
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.680]   First of all, they're putting more horses behind it
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   Um, this is an experiment. This is this is the real deal. Although it isn't beta if you have but if you have google play music already
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.400]   Uh, you'll have music key. Oh, there's the dream of many sites that there's going to be a mondo paywall
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.920]   And then everybody shares revenue from that and in some countries the dream is it'll be a tax fee like bbc
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.720]   But the problem is music is a unique property
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.760]   Uh and information is not yeah, right?
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.280]   Yeah, that's why I don't think
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.480]   I mean, I think there's probably more youtube
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   creators who will be able to make you know a significant or
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:59.480]   Dominal amount from this more so than websites that publish news content. Is that the next step for us, Susan?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.560]   Wojcie the extend the
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.600]   Model to youtube content itself
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.960]   Besides music. I don't see why not
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.240]   Yeah, she's kind of indicated. She might she's thinking about it right other alternative ways to monetize
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   Well, it's all a way to compete with that place. Yeah, exactly
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.240]   I have to say I continually when I don't consume a lot of content on youtube but my kids do and their friends do and
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.680]   Friends kids do and every time I run into somebody they tell me about some youtube
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.600]   Star who I have literally never heard of who has
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.920]   50 million subscribers, right and they you know unbox
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.800]   makeup or something or they they talk about kids toys or they and it's you've never heard of them
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.240]   And they have more subscribers than half of the tv network
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.320]   channels that you have heard of it's a mind boggling sort of
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:00.280]   Every time it it strikes me when I have these conversations. I think this is it's pretty amazing in a way that some
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.000]   Woman who we don't even know her name
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.040]   Lives in somewhere in florida and makes
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.600]   15 million dollars a year
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.480]   Talking about kids toys on youtube. Yeah, michael fan who is the makeup the youtube star does makeup
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.320]   Tips, but I think a lot of her money she makes selling subscriptions to a monthly makeup sampler
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.120]   Mailer, so this is a pro. I'm not sure you know I
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:32.680]   Nobody reveals how much they make on youtube exactly so you never you're always speculating on right, uh, but it seems like incredible
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.840]   Her model is actually kind of sensible
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.720]   Which is you get some money from youtube but you also view it as a promotional vehicle for other enterprises
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.440]   It seems like the people were making money with the exception of pewdiepie and a few of the really big stars
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.520]   Most of their significant portion that money comes from other sources
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.080]   that youtube fosters
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.400]   But if you look at and so good example of what you're talking about i'm trying to remember the
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.200]   the girl's name
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.480]   Zoe
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.080]   something and she's
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.560]   A youtube star and is now I guess writing a book or publishing a book
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.360]   That book is going to be a number one bestseller
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.200]   Like literally as soon as she said yeah that she was writing book
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.640]   Right because she already has this built-in community of millions of desperate fans
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.680]   Right, you know so that book is going to fly off the shelves or whatever virtual shows
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.600]   I feel like um one of the things
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.800]   Susan wojcie is going to have to fight and one of the things youtube is going to have to fight
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.080]   Is the realization by the vast majority of youtubers that they are not going to make much money
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.720]   Uh, and that uh, they are going to need to figure out something else if you know
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.360]   There's this dream of being michael jordan
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.040]   Um, but but most of them don't get to be play the nba
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.720]   And uh, it's I think even a smaller percentage that get to make a lot of money on youtube
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Um, and youtube makes a lot of money on the long tail
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.200]   Of people who are not making money, but youtube is and I feel like it's a point
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.320]   There's going to be a come to jesus moment for youtube where they're going to have to
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.680]   Provide some way for these people to make money or lose them
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.280]   Well, they're investing in I went to the opening of their studio in new york
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.840]   They're investing in a tremendous amount and trying to get people to make content
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.760]   They've got to do a better job. Probably what they have to do is reduce google's share
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.600]   To increase the size of the network and of course, it's not the only revenue stream for a lot of these people as you just said
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.320]   They you know the musicians have tours, but then
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.800]   Jack connie wrote a great piece on medium of pumble moose at
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.320]   Natalie dawn and patreon fame. I put it on the rundown at the very bottom under numbers
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.800]   But you're welcome to take it and talked about the tour that he and nadley just had and what they lost in the end
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.520]   And it's oh that's we had pumple moose in here. I think the world of them jack
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.440]   Who who learned a lot by becoming a youtube star
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:57.080]   Um, and they made money. They were they did chevy ads and stuff, but uh, he founded patreon for that very reason
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.640]   Um, so they did a 28 day tour and I remember they were when jack and uh
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.560]   Natalie Natalie were here. They talked about this and they said in fact I said come back promote the tour 24 shows three 23 cities
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.080]   Uh, they sold a hundred thousand dollars in tickets
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   um
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.800]   I think they made about that revenue was 140 something and they lost
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.200]   But they lost money 17 million or 17 000
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:30.120]   They they lost money in the tour. They did. Yeah, they could have gone out as a duo
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   Um, but they that was what they wanted to do. They want you know any and he says i'm not complaining
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.080]   I'm very lucky we get make a living from music that he says right out what they pay themselves and stipends from what they do the rest
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.160]   They invest back. It's very detailed breakdown. This is really really
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.280]   I wish everybody would do this because I think it would then be what we don't have is this information
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.960]   Uh about youtube. I wish people would do the same thing for youtube
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   Maybe youtube prevents them from doing that. I don't know and to be fair what what they said was they saw this as an investment
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.480]   You know, they knew they weren't gonna make money. Right. They they knew they were gonna make money
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.040]   But this was a way of getting their themselves and their music and their name and so on
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.680]   To more people in their places. This is circle
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.400]   Isn't it because because we always say well, they don't make money on selling albums anymore
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.560]   But they make money on selling tickets. So now they go out and they make money on selling tickets and
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   They move money on that to try to make money on selling albums and they'll make it up with volume
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.360]   You know, it's it's a vicious to be fair every rock band in history lost money in it on a tour or two
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.160]   Um because they this stuff is very easy to lose money on if you if you don't yeah, you're not extraordinarily careful
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.320]   hugely expensive. Yeah
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.440]   uh, and
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.360]   And actually bob left sets whose hilarious to read at
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.600]   All the time of the left this letter is so great. Yeah wrote a letter about pomple moves and about this piece
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.040]   And I thought he was overly harsh because I don't think they were writing it to say
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   Oh poor us. We're not making money in fact. They they distinctly didn't say that right but his point was
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.920]   uh, basically
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.560]   You know, you're on your own you don't
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.840]   If you decide to do these tours
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.520]   You then you know, you have to either do them in a way that makes money or accept the fact that they're not going to make money
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.280]   It's not it's you can't blame anyone else for the fact that people don't come to your shows or don't
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.600]   Buy your stuff lately. I've been binge reading rock and roll biographies and graham nash
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.520]   writes about
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.360]   uh, crossby stills and nash tour
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.520]   That I think david crossby called the tour from hell. I can't remember what he called it
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   But they were all the tour they were all they lost a ton of money
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.400]   And the record putting a record company into this mix is it going to make things better for pomple moves
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.320]   It's just going to make one more one more company sucking profits out of it
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   Um, this is it's hard to do it always has been hard to do
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.040]   um
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.480]   And it's in fact that that they came that close to breaking even I thought was a success like that
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.400]   They did a pretty good job, you know for people who have never put together a nationwide tour before that's a good point
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.200]   They did it all on their own. Mm-hmm pretty amazing
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.480]   But it shows you I thought he uh, he made a point partway down
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:21.560]   That you know, which I thought was the sort of optimistic way of looking at what we're talking about them. The industry has expanded
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.440]   in such a massive way there you know, there's there's a whole middle
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.000]   Category now of groups that can maybe not
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.600]   Become super famous or super rich but can actually make a living doing the things they want to do and connecting with their fans
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.960]   Without a label that's so sure they're not going to be
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.720]   Britney Spears, but they're but they can at least do it that literally wasn't possible before
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.920]   Yeah, there's a whole chain of value and creativity. I think I mentioned on the show before I've been involved in this war economic forum
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.200]   Project on on post copyright
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.000]   uh, and and in that chain of value we need more ways to
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.640]   Recognize the creation of value like creating audiences and remixing and adding in and more ways to extract value like getting data about your audience
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.200]   And being able to sell tickets and things
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.240]   Um, it's going to have to be a new mix we figure out and again, I want to make a point
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.280]   To talk about it when it comes to a creative unique
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:28.840]   entertaining entity like a singer or a movie or a novel is
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.360]   A very different from the model of an information based
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   Uh industry like like news, but we've conflated the jukes. We think they're all storytellers and they all
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.840]   You know have attention and they all have time, but they're they're incredibly different model
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.040]   They need to be incredibly different business models and on both sides
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.360]   They're disrupted and they need to reinvent themselves. Although I think there is some overlap
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.840]   I mean someone like andrew solven for example in the daily dish to me
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.280]   I wrote a whole column comparing him to a mandapama
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   Because to me the sort of model that they're both pursuing is is fundamentally identical. I'm
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.920]   I'm a musician. I'm a columnist style blogger writer
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:16.280]   But I have a community of fans who who adore me or hate me or some combination they're of and and are
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:22.920]   fascinated with me and want to come to things that I'm involved with or want to buy things that are related to me that
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   You know one is
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.160]   talking about politics and one is
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:34.840]   Music but but the sort of approach to that to the community and how you derive value from that that personal relationship is very similar
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.160]   You actually just wrote an article you know, but he's a nessent and entertainer
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.880]   and um
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.960]   It doesn't hold to me to go to straight news to find out what the grand jury no
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.400]   I wasn't for a sudden is not so no control alone
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.360]   Right, but it to me it it it reinforces the need for
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:01.880]   a sort of not pure personality but a personal voice in a personal perspective
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.680]   Yes, if you can really do it and do it well
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:13.800]   But to have the 87th take on the same news we already know and to say my value is to add a little personality to that
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.680]   That goes thin real real fast. Do I say that in a place where we're not doing reporting right now?
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.800]   We're just yeah, by the way, that's exactly what dude. You have so thanks
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.480]   But you are well
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:34.440]   But the thing I like about Andrews model and and
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.520]   Amanda Palmer's model is it is just them and their fans
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:46.440]   So that that was why Andrew wanted to do the sort of direct crowdfunding or paywall or whatever you want to call it
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.760]   He wanted it to just be him
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.680]   And his audience or readers or community. That's all that matters. No one else is involved in that relationship
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:02.360]   So there's no intermediary. There's no, you know, and there weren't even any advertisers to begin with just him and and his community
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.640]   Yeah, and if he serves them he wins and if he doesn't he's doing well
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.480]   Yeah, he's making a million dollars. Okay, that's well
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.320]   Yeah, that's pretty good
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:17.400]   I mean, he's got a team, you know, it's not just him, but I still think that's that's a substantial amount of money
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:24.360]   Why is and is is this so okay? So how does uh, what does this mean for uh?
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.640]   Others is this model he had a
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.800]   Andrew Sullivan had quite a following to begin with he did he did that seems to be a big part of this right?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.040]   It does. Yeah, although one of the guys that I'm interested in is uh,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.840]   Ben Thompson who I wrote about recently. Yeah, but super smart guy
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:49.960]   Um his blog is great. That's by the way, you know, and I've been that's you I'm glad you brought him up because here's a guy who didn't have
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.200]   a following exactly but because he's so smart
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.280]   Uh people like us we've had him on twit many times
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.560]   Uh people like you a lot of people talk about him
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.480]   Because he's so smart. So it's possible. Yeah not to start without a following, but you have to be exceptional if you're gonna do that
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.560]   Well, I think what you do
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.760]   Is he still in up in and what I would say is a blockbuster economy
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.120]   You can support a certain number of stars you and resell of an
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.400]   Uh, Thompson fine, but there's only so much it's it's harder and harder and harder
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.720]   In an abundant world to get up to that top level where you can make it work
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.840]   Now it's always it's been true. How many musicians have there been and how many have been supported? How many so always been that way? That's right?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.880]   Yeah
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.520]   I think we have a better where this is better than the blockbuster. I think you can have
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.320]   more smaller successes
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.480]   And the pie up bigger, right? And I think Ben is a great example of that Ben is a perfect example of
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.840]   Kevin kelly's thousand true fans when I spoke to him recently he had
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   Just crossed that threshold so is revenue comes not from advertising but from selling a newsletter zero advertising
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.920]   Yeah, so just the newsletter just access to his forums
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:13.560]   Um, I think there's advertising on the podcast or there will be but he gives away a huge amount of time
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:21.320]   On his site is free right and so he's that right he's making on a on his sort of run rate right now
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.200]   He is making a living for himself
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.440]   From a thousand true fans. So that's the potential
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.560]   So $10 a month a hundred dollars a year to subscribe to his daily newsletter
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.800]   So it's very affordable. I'll compare that to Jessica lessons the information which is four hundred dollars a year four hundred bucks
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.240]   Right and and so is he making a killing no?
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.840]   Is he hugely wealthy? No, but he's making a guy
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.720]   He's making a living and he is one guy. There's no one else. Yeah, so
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.520]   What has enabled him to do that?
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.880]   Is the web and social media and all the tools?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.560]   You know cloud tools and all the things that have allowed startups to
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.960]   To grow and and prosper with lower costs just barriers to entry are a lot lower
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.520]   everyone is not going to be able to do that but your ability to do that is is
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.000]   Far greater than it used to be it's kind is it kind of a meritocracy?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.480]   Yeah, I think so
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.240]   I think so. I mean Ben Thompson before he started writing his blog
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:30.360]   Maybe a few people knew him because he was a p.m. At apple or google or whatever, but he was virtually unknown
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.000]   and then he started writing smart
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.920]   analysis of
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.720]   Tech topics and there's always going to be a hunger for that
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.680]   um, he's made it harder for the next person to try and do the same thing
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.520]   Because now he's kind yeah, I don't know if that's true. I
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.320]   I think that
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:57.400]   To me it's there's a real close parallel to the music industry where the era of the platinum artist making hundreds of millions of dollars is over
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.640]   Or i maybe not but
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.440]   It's it's less important and what what that does mean is that many more artists
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:11.400]   Even pomple most can make a living doing what they're doing. Mm-hmm. And I think that's preferable
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:17.240]   Uh to me that's preferable to the other way of doing things but
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.760]   Regardless of whether it's preferable or not. It's kind of where we're headed
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.120]   I think the only real concern was that no one would make a living
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:31.240]   Mm-hmm. I know when I when I first wrote about uh, I don't know if it was banner
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.720]   But I mentioned the thousand true fans idea and I got an email
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:43.000]   Uh from someone a musician who had been inspired by kevin kelly's post which was years ago now
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.560]   Um, and he said that he was
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.280]   Effectively doing that the only thing he pointed out was that it's a lot of work
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.400]   It's it's a lot more work than just getting signed by a label and they send you checks and you have a handler who?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.680]   Takes you around places and whatever like you have to do get that to y'all is tiny
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:09.960]   Right exactly. I hear point a minute ago is there are more people who can be the independent and straight by living with really hard work
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.160]   Then there were people who could make a living in music before how hard do you think taylor swift works these days
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:21.320]   She works pretty hard. I think she works pretty hard. Yeah, she has all the benefits of a major label
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.560]   Managers
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:30.120]   Social media managers no doubt but to be really a success these days. I don't care who you are. I think you need to work really hard
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.080]   But I would agree that that
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.800]   You know that we've still got the big heads. We've still got taylor swift. We've still got you know big artists
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.000]   They seem to be going with a million dollar. Yeah, no, but there's more room in between exactly, you know
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.920]   In between them and the sort of starving artists at the bottom
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.800]   You don't have to get the label the record label deal
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.000]   You know, listen reading, um, really enjoyed
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   Keith richards book life
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.680]   And and he says we were all struggling, you know in england to get that record deal
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.720]   That was all we live for every moment. That's what we live for because that's the only path to success
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.440]   Now there are many paths to success. That's good, right?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.240]   Definitely in fact you could argue a man of pomber by telling her record label
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.920]   He got lost and doing what she wanted to is far better off
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.800]   Well, the dress that dolls were kind of an arty an arty group, right?
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.880]   I mean, they weren't they weren't ever going to be plotting them
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.600]   No, no
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.480]   No, and she has a book out now about justice model about about about giving people the opportunity to give
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   But I have to say there is no one path and I love that and everybody's right in the book
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.760]   Well, this is how I did and the truth is what's great is
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.680]   There are as many paths now as there are people and that's how it's supposed to be
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.640]   That's how it should be it means there's opportunity. It doesn't mean you don't get you don't have to work hard
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.400]   Amen
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.800]   Also the generosity of jack conty and amanda pomber in sharing how they do it and sharing what they
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.240]   Ethos isn't it I think and that's what bothers me a little bit about youtube is it's such a black box
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.600]   I'm glad to see jack conty giving you know giving us the info
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.160]   And that's what we do here at twit and I think that's the ethos and it's important because
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.680]   It's not look twit is no model for anybody except me
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.880]   But I think it's good for people to see the inside guts of it so that they can think about their model
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   But there are lessons there there are even if you don't
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.640]   What does hello jason calicontus?
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:30.120]   There are lessons and models and what you do and and people can can steal the best of it for this right for them
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:36.280]   Yeah, and there are good. I mean amanda pomer has talked about some of the difficult parts of her model
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.120]   You know, she she got a lot of criticism for her tour
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.240]   Inviting people up to play and not paying them that turned into a big deal
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.560]   She talked about that quite openly
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.920]   She talked about where the money went she you know, I think if you once you
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.880]   Kind of make that leap to crowdfunding or having your fans support you
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.440]   it's incumbent on you to
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.840]   To talk to them
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.440]   and and sort of
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.720]   You know be open about transparencies discuss those things. Yeah, transparency
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.600]   I would argue that now everybody is dependent on their community
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:19.080]   That that's pretty much the way it's always been but we just didn't know it and you cannot hide and transparency is good
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.160]   Um, why I just read an article. Um, I guess it was on slate about poor jennifer lorence
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.640]   who is her
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:34.440]   Career is mirroring catness's career in the hunter games. It's kind of the involuntary, you know, I didn't
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.760]   She didn't know what she signed up for she said I knew that the paparazzi be annoying. I didn't know they'd be terrifying
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.560]   And uh, and you know, and then some people make it she's she's making it because
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:54.440]   She is able to somehow survive all the attention of scrutiny the terrifying events and be an interesting human
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.280]   Maybe she's not authentic. She feels very authentic
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.680]   Um, and uh, and that's going to be going forward. I don't care if you're
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.080]   In the old, you know blockbuster movie model or in your in the modern
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.000]   Community funded, you know independent artist model that's gonna be going forward. I think a requirement
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.400]   That's why taylor's with us to work her butt off
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:21.480]   Because she's posting on instagram and tweeting and she's out there and then I think old invisible
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.720]   Stars are not gonna make it anymore. They're not gonna play and I think jeff and i definitely agree
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.040]   I think we agree that
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   media companies of all kinds
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.880]   have to
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.400]   in in fact
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.640]   Journalists, I think have to be much more
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.040]   Aware of the relationship that they have yes with the readers
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:46.920]   Precise if if they have one and if they don't have one they should get one get one soon. That's super important. That is the lesson, isn't it?
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.720]   Well, that's that matthew your book should be there any and my book should be there any day
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.200]   And that's exactly what i'm going is it's about relationship based model. Yeah, right?
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.520]   I think it is how there is a is there's a one common thread in all these different models. It's that
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.480]   And and I know you know this sort of ties into what we were talking about with
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.080]   Facebook and how media companies and individuals even are
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   Are kind of relying on these platforms to do a lot of the work for them and to sort of reach a community
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:21.480]   And i've had people say well what so what should you do if you're a media company and
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   Facebook basically controls how people see your content and you have no
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.760]   Say over how that happens or even any understanding of how it happens and my only response has been
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.440]   You have to be able to give your readers and your community something that facebook cannot
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:43.880]   Facebook can give them a link facebook can give them lots of other stuff but facebook can't give them what you can give them
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.280]   Which is a personal connection with them
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.840]   and and other ways of kind of
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:55.320]   Of pursuing that relationship apart from just clicking on things on the internet facebook is just one instance though of
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.120]   A whole lot of copyright has broken apart patons were breaking
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.200]   The things that we used in the past traditionally to protect the creator and to guarantee them a revenue stream
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.240]   Those things don't work anymore and and modern things like facebook are they're ultimately going to break
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.960]   So it all comes down to building a community
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.720]   At your in relationship with and that will transcend these other broken models like copyright and facebook
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:26.120]   And I think the you know when I work for a newspaper the model was if you were a person like me
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.800]   was get
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.240]   X or Y job with X or Y publication
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:37.800]   And then you're you're sad. Yeah, you know, you have a platform. You have a distribution channel that you control
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.560]   You just get to say whatever you want the end then you just cash your checks and go home
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.120]   And that just doesn't work anymore
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:53.000]   I I find this exciting. It's always disruption. You know with this kind of disruption is always tough on people
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.720]   But I just I think that that ultimately this is I hope this is leading to what we thought the internet would be all about which is
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.480]   democratizing media and giving everybody
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.880]   Yeah, that's what I celebrate. Yes, you know, listen definitely with the first newspapers
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.920]   Came in 1605. Sorry breaking game guy time guys 150 years
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.000]   of the gutenberg press
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.320]   And it the first ones all fail
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.760]   They didn't have a business model. They didn't know what they were doing. It was hard
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.080]   Newspapers fell by the wayside one after another after another and then figure it out
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.000]   And then in long-term esteem price which helped a lot
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.080]   But it took time to get the models it took time to figure it out. We're nowhere near. Yeah, we should know no no
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.600]   I mean the consumer web, you know, is is barely what 20 years old?
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.200]   So you expected it'll change again
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.920]   I think it is still change. It's gonna constantly change
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.760]   I mean, is it fair to say that building community is a will be always a key
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.120]   Authenticity I think it will be because I mean Amanda talks about this all the time
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.680]   She was a busker before she started right, you know being a professional musician
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.880]   Busking has been around, you know, probably since streets were invented and so
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:14.200]   You know, that's the original model you play and people throw things in your case
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.800]   It's you just have now you the street is
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:24.680]   Infinitely long and you can theoretically reach lots of people. There's also lots of other people doing the same thing
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.560]   Yeah, she was what she was a bride
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.520]   Boston she'd stand on a box
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.360]   She was a robot bride and would bend down and yeah
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.400]   I mean she's her TED talk is a great introduction to that and I would like to see her do her stuff
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:47.320]   She's done and and one thing about Amanda like not everyone can do what she does she goes
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.440]   She takes her connection to her fans to to lengths that I'm not sure
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.560]   Homes and sleeps in their beds
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.800]   She has parties where like some of the things she did for her kickstarter for the record where she offered private
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:07.880]   Listing parties and performance parties and afterwards she would take all their clothes off and people could paint her
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.840]   Yeah, with paint well, not everyone is going to be comfortable taking their relationship to that extreme
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.360]   Right, that's what she wants to do. That's the other part of it. You have to be true to yourself
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.920]   Yeah, um, that's authenticity. I guess I have also tried that by the way that but nobody wanted to paint you
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.240]   No one was
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:34.360]   I've met this that very interesting if you're just tuning in jina has the day off
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.840]   She's getting ready for Thanksgiving. I hope you all are well
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.000]   You've already had your Thanksgiving Matthew last month
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.080]   Um, hope you're all playing the real Canadian
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.240]   Thanksgiving

[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.000]   Okay

[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.160]   Yeah, I'll have a turkey dog

[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.720]   information about the latest nexus phone because
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.040]   Whenever we get these two together, we're going to talk about stuff like this, but I you know, I think
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:21.800]   If we do add value, it's not regurgitating the latest news stories, but it's uh doing the deep thought stuff where we kind of
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.240]   Think about what it means and uh what it means for us and
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.360]   You know for all of us and uh, and I think that that stuff's important and then to that the extent that we do that
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   I think we create original content. So please forgive us
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.600]   I want to talk about shoes

[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.920]   um, I do when you choose the size
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.000]   Subtract one full size from your shoe size to order
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.200]   So if you wear a size 10 buy the size 9 because jack erwin doesn't skimp
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.920]   They don't skimp on the size
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.440]   I wear normally I wear a 9 I got 8 and a half
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.520]   They're beautiful. Look at these. These are the ones I can't wait to wear
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.800]   uh to the holiday parties these are wing tips

[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   And and we're talking prices that are
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:46.840]   One quarter to one third as much as the high quality fine men's stores that you'd go to
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:52.760]   You go to barnies you're going to spend a lot more than if you go to jack erwin.com of course many of us can't even get to barnies
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.120]   Buying shoes should be fun. The experience should be memorable
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   The quality should be right

[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.920]   We thank them for their support of twig
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.960]   We uh, we're happy to say that uh apple has buried the hatchet
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.640]   apple had purchased along with uh erickson
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.760]   sony
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.440]   Uh couple at microsoft had purchased the nortail patons
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.400]   apple put 2.6 billion dollars
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:23.160]   Into those patons their uh, their consortium outbid google and paid four and a half billion a few years ago
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.640]   For the patons and then
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.840]   The partners microsoft and apple formed a company called rock star up your way in canada
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.640]   Actually, I think they're on the west coast
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.960]   Uh and all they were what we call euphemistically a non practicing entity
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.800]   And not that means a patent troll my friends in the october last year rockstar suit google
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.240]   handset manufacturers like htc and sam sangh
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:56.120]   Android handset saying uh that they had infringed seven nortail patons actually in the case of a google all related to search engine technology
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.520]   google and rock star have settled
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.960]   And I have a feeling that
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:08.200]   Rockstar has also settled with the hand sape makers including sam sangh. This is apple finally saying okay
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.080]   Enough of the thermonuclear war
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.240]   Um, it's done and I think this is very very good new sisco is side of term sheet with rock star
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.800]   Um, it looks like we looks like it's we don't know what the settlement was though, right?
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.720]   for uh
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.560]   Not for google for sisco
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.360]   We think it was fairly hefty because they said they they're they're taking a 188 million dollar charge
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.520]   But I don't know if there is any
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.080]   Money changing hands for these other ones
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   I think it's often thought that just apple lost it's either lost its stomach for the lawsuits or maybe more likely realized it was hurting apple
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.880]   Uh, the lawsuits were revealing stuff about apple that they didn't want to have revealed
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:57.560]   Um, and and they weren't winning outright and even in sam sangh case they didn't get the money they wanted
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.320]   So I think that's what it's partly happening is that these companies are seeing that
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.520]   This is bad for business all of this patent trolling
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.040]   I'm glad to see
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.360]   Somebody making some money up nor tell networks
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:17.320]   Is it a canadian company is that why the rock stars and can't yeah. Yeah, yeah, nor tell
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.000]   Nor tell was huge. Oh, I used to have a nor tell phone
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.760]   Yeah, it was a gigantic part of the canadian
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.480]   Econ oh really? I mean
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.360]   And it flamed out in spectacular fashion
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.760]   Followed the canadian over the long term now blackberry
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.160]   Ron nor tell yeah
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:47.000]   But nor till definitely had like nor till labs did some of the early groundbreaking work on
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.760]   Networks and then telecom sorts of stuff
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.640]   It's not that it's not that those patents weren't real
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.160]   No, no, they were definitely real. Yeah, it's just that uh, I believe apple and microsoft
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.320]   Uh, we're using a man at competitive like they were trying to put other companies in a business
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.640]   Not the same. I'm just the same thing in the other direction by the way, right? Everybody does it
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.800]   Everybody's thermal nuclear war. That's just stop. No
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.600]   It's not good for us end users
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.240]   Because so much money is poured into this litigation instead of into innovation
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.200]   And there's lots of you know, you can
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.160]   it's hard to sort of
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.240]   Argue based on what hasn't been created, but you can certainly imagine lots of interesting
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.040]   Things someone won't be huge ton of allegedly related patents, right?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.640]   Oh, I think there's startups that die stillborn all the time
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.400]   Because people realize that they would be sued out of existence and they just say you know what?
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.720]   We're not gonna do we're not going there
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.160]   And for a long time when I was writing about tech companies and stocks and and as investments
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:57.080]   Um advisors were telling companies look you have to get you have to have something proprietary
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.520]   That is patentable has been patented or you have to buy something
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.240]   Just so that you can wave it around defensively, you know, yeah, defensively exactly. Yeah
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.960]   Um, who was it what was I article as I reading about apple with?
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.720]   uh
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.640]   Lawyers would come to you know the engineers and say okay. What have you done today?
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:22.840]   And then the engineer would say well, I did this. Oh, that's patentable. What else and then we just they would be filing patents on everything. Yeah. Yeah
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.480]   Well, that's patentable
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:33.960]   It's because and I hope that this happens too is it's because of these process spattens and these software patents that don't have anything to do with physical
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.400]   Machines, yeah, they're in abomination. Yeah
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.040]   Google has turned on the dot google tld
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.120]   Um currently it redirects to the google registry
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:54.680]   Google also owns dot ads dot dad dot fly dot how dot new dot move
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   dot

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.800]   Okay, no, just type translate in front of it. Oh, yeah, yeah trans

[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.280]   And now we're in general availability
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.640]   It's just a giant ican money graph
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   It's not google. It's ican that makes the money on this, huh? Yeah. Yeah, here's some dot soy's
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   Interesting
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.840]   Oh, these are other registrars you can go to uh
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.680]   What is I seem to remember that the
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.560]   Some of these uh, these are not actually tlds that
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:50.840]   I don't know how this works, but that they don't they don't necessarily work at all dns
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   Is
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.160]   Really that's what they did. Well, they should they ought to because otherwise that breaks the web, right?
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.360]   But uh, I think my line. I don't know. I don't know how it goes
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:09.320]   Dot google is uh is a brand tld remember ican that was the ican thing where if you have you know a couple hundred thousand
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.560]   Dollars lying around you can get your own domain
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.600]   So I could have got a twit is dot apple dot lego dot for rea rea. Yeah
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.960]   um, apple bbc intel
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.080]   FedEx and heins
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.560]   Among the brands dot google has gone live
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:37.320]   Who wants to type something dot google? I know well, no, but no better. They own it. Somebody else maybe that's the idea
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.800]   Or dot heins or dot dad
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.200]   57 dot heins
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:49.480]   Do you remember dot moby? Yeah, whatever happened to that. Yeah, we had a big discussion at the globe the newspaper
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:56.520]   I worked for to should we register a dot mo will be the address? Well, no because no one uses them right and in fact
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:02.200]   Exists you don't really want a mobile only site. You want a site that's uh mobile friendly, but yeah, right?
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.000]   You can't you can't keep track of the web
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.440]   You just can't it's most too fast
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.120]   So the gop and bright bard have tricked google
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.760]   Tell me about this jeffrey
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:21.720]   Oh, just my minor thing that they it's what we what we used to call that when you um google bombing pile all kinds of google bombing
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.600]   Right, right?
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.840]   Right. So bright bard was just happy that google that if you search for um, what do I have for you?
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.920]   That's a king of the usa
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.520]   Yeah, usa
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.520]   king of united states you'll get
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:37.160]   Well
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.040]   To be honest to be fair we did this to uh
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.280]   The left did the yeah king of the united states ask google who is king of the united states and they will inform you
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:52.680]   This is funny because this is actually a knowledge graph that refers back to the search engine land article about
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.720]   How to google bomb the google bomb
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:04.040]   Well google bomb. Yeah, so it's just so it was minor. That's bizarre all hail king barack obama emperor of the united states
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.320]   Says bright bard and they said it enough. I guess
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.200]   That google said okay
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   but for some reason
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:18.520]   When I get this story from a media i it's got a picture of daren wilson next to it
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.600]   So i'm now really confused
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:28.360]   What's going on that it's confusing the photo algorithm does screw up. It screws up a lot. Yeah, they're just pulling a random photo random photo
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:32.920]   All right, so google bombing still exists. Yeah, that's all
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.120]   What are you gonna do?
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.400]   That's hey, that's interesting the second i just learned something the second link on my when I did that search
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.960]   Was prince henry of prussia
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:52.280]   Uh who apparently was at one point suggested as candidate for king of the us. Oh, well. Yeah, so there's a little history for you there
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.080]   google
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.480]   Fiber if you're lucky enough to have it
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:03.240]   In austin in austin you dogs you
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.560]   Will be $70 a month for the gigabit service, but they're
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.520]   The basic service lio. This is the amazing part to me there it will there be five megabit per second
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.000]   Five one basic service for free
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.280]   Free wow you'll pay it's kind of build fee and then you'll be on the internet for free
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.560]   That's aimed straight at dsl providers because five one is kind of a typical dsl speed
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:29.800]   Yeah, for which they charge 20 to 40 dollars a month. So free
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.920]   It says there's a construction fee of 300
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.360]   Yes, but you know amortize that over a couple of years and then it's free from then on
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.760]   It goes to google's business model the more you use the internet the more google nips will stop
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:48.360]   Now $70 will get you a terabyte of cloud storage
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.040]   One gigabit service $130 a month
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.880]   You will get tv channels as well and a dvr that will grow up to eight shows at once
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.040]   I imagine it's a cloud dvr
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.400]   Gosh, do you so can it's it started in kansas city
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.040]   Lot of fanfare provo uta
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.880]   Austin they're planning to go to phoenix, arizona and nashville, tennessee
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.560]   Do you think this is now a business for google that maybe they're gonna roll this out everywhere?
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.160]   I know at first it was just to to rattle the cages of the
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.640]   Isp's
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.960]   Run like a business feels like this is growing. I don't see why they wouldn't roll it out
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.200]   I mean it would make me happy
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.360]   If it's getting more people online and right?
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:38.040]   It's a capital intensive for the bill, but the lord knows they've got the capital
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.880]   It's a way to put it to work and they get they get a higher dividend than anybody else because you're using the internet right?
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.160]   Right that's they have a business model around this that makes sense
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.240]   uh compared to t-mobile
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.200]   Who knows that the more you z internet the more they don't like that
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.720]   They have been reducing if you if you went over your cat
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:06.680]   They would they've been reducing you to 128 kilobits or even 64 kilobits
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:13.800]   Unless you ran a speed test and i would say oh speed test quick turn it up kidding you're kidding me. No. No, that's true
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.280]   It's not legal anymore. They uh they're now gonna have to tell you
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:23.560]   the federal communications commission investigated and they uh made
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:28.440]   They made the t-mobile the t-mobiles agreed that they will actually send text messages to customers
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:34.200]   That will tell them exactly what's happening and that their speed is you know has been reduced because they exceeded caps
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:42.920]   So they wouldn't tell people well the worst no not only would they not tell them, but they would lie uh they would they would turn it up on the speed test
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.000]   That's mind boggling
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   That sounds like a good company
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.840]   Fine to do the right thing and make a whole big marketing push about how worthy uncarrier. That's a very carrier
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:59.800]   Well, and they are also they exempt some streaming music services from download caps from data limits
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:05.080]   Uh, that's that's that fast lane prioritization. We've been talking about neutral
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   One of them by the way google music and the other xbox music
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:17.240]   See this is one where you go and soundcloud too as well. Uh, this is where you go god. Well, that's great
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   But it's not really great because if you're not google or xbox or soundcloud
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   There's crew it's anti-competitive
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.800]   actually they now do 27 streaming services, so
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.400]   Maybe the goal is to sell more t mobile
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:40.120]   Uh, you know accounts than to actually make money off of these guys pandaora wraps at the iHeart radio iTunes
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.480]   Samsung has something called milk i've never heard of
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.200]   Very poor name by the way
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.320]   I don't get the milk services
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.680]   slackers Spotify groveshark arty o
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:59.160]   Uh, there are now 14 new services including xbox as we mentioned google play soundcloud
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:05.400]   radio tunes digitally imported fit radio fresca radio jazz radio live 365
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.240]   Mad genius radio radio pop radio dot com rock radio and seven
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.400]   I think you could probably say that this is no longer. It's pretty clear. This isn't a way to make
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.280]   You know to do fast lane prioritization, but really it's just to make t mobile more desirable
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.720]   Right. Yes, if you if you let everybody in on this then you're not really choosing winners and losers
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.680]   And atnt it is the same thing by the way
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.880]   Um
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.400]   But yeah, so from now on if you're see i i'm a t-mobile customer and you know what they say and I asked them again and again
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.000]   Unlimited yeah, it's unlimited truly unlimited. Yes truly unlimited
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.480]   Well, it is except that after a certain point they throttle you to 64 kilobits right right that's not limiting it
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.200]   Uh, it sort of feels like it is like it feels like you don't want to use it
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:58.280]   When I've had a habit a couple of times have you and it is I mean, it's practically unusable
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.200]   Yeah, it's like jay
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:06.280]   Like maybe technically it falls into the category of while we're still giving you data, but it's like you're not
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.680]   right
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.680]   What was the limit that you crossed?
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.760]   Because i'm on the i'm on the 30 dollar plan. Oh, you have that to low low
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:20.360]   Which is five five gigs of data a month, okay, and then once you pass that then you get throttled down, okay, and uh
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:26.280]   Yeah, five she was right in that area where you probably hover around five, but sometimes yeah exactly
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.160]   I'd say it hasn't you know, i've had that that plan for a while now
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.040]   I'm probably a little more than a year and I think it's happened to me twice
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.600]   So but you this is why i told them
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:40.760]   Yeah, I mean they tell you right out that you know, it's unlimited
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.880]   But after you pass five gigs, you're gonna be throttled slower speeds
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.200]   So I mean for the 70 I think it's 70 dollars a month and they say no, no, it's unlimited
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:53.000]   So i'm not gonna get throttled. I've never even throttled so I don't know about you. Well, uh, I bet I will
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   I bet there I bet unlimited
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.720]   There was actually a court case in in canada rogers communications who I use or robers as I like to call them
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.760]   Um, they actually went to courts and got a decision that said
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.920]   They could call something unlimited even if it wasn't practically unlimited
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.320]   Rogers is the worst that's great. Yeah
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.480]   Is at a team's grandfather unlimited truly unlimited?
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.600]   No, I don't think anybody's truly unlimited
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.640]   I think i'm limited unless you go over five gigs
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:33.160]   And I want to talk about euro techno panic. That's the the new like zung ziz scranks
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.000]   A new band it's a new band euro techno pan
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.880]   Jeff jeff jeff jeffress
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:46.520]   Spoke about the y'all techno panic at zite. We'll talk about it in just a second first a word for personal
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.680]   capital
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:54.840]   Personal capital is designed to make it easier for you to save for your future whether it's retirement buy in a house
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   Just saving up for a rainy day. The problem of course is it's hard to know what your money's doing
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.440]   First of all, they're all on different accounts on different websites with different
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.040]   passwords
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.480]   And and sometimes hard to tell whether you're paying how much you're paying and fees they hide all that stuff
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.040]   If you're having somebody management, how much are you paying them?
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:20.600]   You're probably paying too much personal capital makes it easy by getting all your account information in one place in a single page
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:26.040]   So you can see where your accounts are where your assets and liabilities are you can use it for budgeting
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.120]   But you can also use it for planning your investments
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.760]   They'll even tell you and by the way, this is on android. This is on ios is on your desktop
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.320]   They have an android wear app, which is so cool. So you get notifications on your watch
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   And then they'll let you know if your 401k is overpaying and fees or it needs to be rebalanced or you know how to optimize
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.640]   You can get tailored advice in optimizing your investment
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.400]   Best of all, all of this is free. It takes up a few minutes to set up and it will pay you big dividends personal capital
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.960]   We love it. It's free. I've been using it for a couple of years and it's so cool
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:01.320]   And it's a smart way to grow your money and you know, it's what's really nice is to get your android wear watch say
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   Oh, you made $800 today what
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.640]   What yes, you did not so nice when it says oh you lost $800
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.440]   today
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:19.000]   Uh, Jeff are you okay? Jeff? I know I lost my camera. I gotta call you right back. Okay. His camera fell off his uh, he's set up
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.840]   Okay
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:28.680]   And we're just about to read his uh
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.400]   His uh, techno euro techno panic
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:38.840]   The translated version says instead of fighting google shoulder stand. I'm not
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.280]   Shoulder stand is not a terrific shoulder stand
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:51.640]   Yes stand on the shoulders of giants. I guess so the story starts with the uh, uh, uh, uh, kind of I don't think a serious
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.920]   Plan but uh, europe
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   the european parliament
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.880]   Somebody there suggested it turns out that somebody
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.560]   Might be a lawyer for some of the big german publishers
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.640]   Uh, like what is it? Shpangar?
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.760]   Spreggar, action spreggar
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.640]   Uh, it's proposed that google should be broken up into smaller companies
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:21.880]   I have to be fair. I have to build power to do that. They can't do that, but I have to be fair
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.960]   I often said I wish google weren't in the content business with youtube
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.080]   I wish google were in the flight business with ita
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:35.000]   It kind of muddles the muddies the waters if they're a search engine that they also own some of the results
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.600]   That they will turn up. I understand the concern about that
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:46.120]   I get that much but but it's also it is an absurd thing and it's purely political. Yeah, and even the new head of the
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.640]   uh, um digital for the EU said this ain't happening. He said that would be an action for a planned economy not a market economy
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.800]   And he's been trying to hit the drum
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.360]   drumbeats against google, but it's gotten absurd in europe and I wrote a
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:07.560]   3000 word essay warnings folks a 3000 word essay on my students should submit and such and
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.560]   um, the backstory here is that I went to the frankfurter auga mine at zieton which has been the leader of
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:20.200]   Technopanic they wouldn't run it, but my good friends at dite which is a far better newspaper anyway
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.440]   Uh, it's online. Uh did run it in german and in english both links are on the run now. Um, um,
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.200]   So it's just kind of my what I said was that I think that europe is becoming a hostile environment for technology
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.400]   You add up all the things we've talked about on this show in germany plus
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.840]   The spanish link tax plus the right to be forgotten plus the EU on um
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.800]   You know these these efforts to force the EU into a breaking up google
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:53.080]   Who the hell would go invest in europe? So I go on about that. Um, I go on about, um,
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.840]   Technopanic we've heard that school before but then at the end I do criticize google for saying I don't think they've done enough
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:06.440]   Uh, they need to even though they they legally do what's right about taxes. They got us all that they haven't been open enough about the nsa
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.560]   Um, even if I believe them that they're not
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:16.680]   Cooperative they still need to be more open. Uh, they should be investing more in technology companies in europe to create a technology environment there
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:25.160]   They should be doing as we discussed earlier real things to try to fix and help the news business not necessarily incumbents, but but but news as society
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.880]   Uh, and I and I what I hope for is a return to kind of the wonder of the old days of of world's fairs and such
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:38.120]   Um, but uh, I just I just see that you know, it's all added up in europe and it's a pretty frightening picture
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.720]   Really get right down to it. And so this is for deproboring all in one place
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.240]   It's uh, you really have nothing to do after dinner tomorrow. Thanks to be
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.680]   You want to get maps? This is the way fix your mic. I think we're using your laptop mic
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   Pope frances agrees with you. Did you know that he addressed the euro european parliament?
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.440]   Or the i'm sorry the council of europe in Strasbourg and he called europe an old infertile granny
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.960]   Wow
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   ow
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.240]   Oh, pope frances said europe should stop treating people as cogs in the machine
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.520]   europe is aging and weary in many quarters
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:24.600]   The pope said we encounter a general impression of weariness and aging of a europe which is now a grandmother
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.640]   No longer fertile and vibrant as a result
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.320]   The great ideas which once inspired europe seemed to have lost their attraction
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.680]   Only to be replaced by the bureaucratic technicalities of insta of its institutions
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:42.760]   Wow says the head of the most bureaucratic and oldest institution in europe the pope
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.040]   You've got a big ally here jeff
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:52.280]   Geez got a problem when the pope is criticizing play that if the pope calls you a granny
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.120]   In furtile granny and infertile granny
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.680]   I'm liking this pope. I gotta tell you he's not like any pope. I can remember
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   No, he's a new world
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080]   he's in some
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:12.680]   Men and women are risk being reduced to mere cogs in a machine that treats them as items of consumption to be exploited
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.920]   With the result that as is so tragically apparent whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.560]   It is discarded with few qualms
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.440]   As in the case of the terminally ill
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:31.000]   The elderly who are abandoned are uncared for oh here. We go. Here's the pope. I know in love and children who are killed in the war
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.280]   Had to throw that one in there we go had to throw that one in
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.560]   um wow, okay
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.760]   So so you're in good. You're in good. You're a good uh good partnership company. Yeah good company
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.640]   Google
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.640]   Saint Jarvis
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.160]   I wonder he's coming to the us. I wonder what he's gonna say to us
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.680]   and you
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.000]   Europe may be an infertile granny, but you
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.160]   you're like
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   Granny and hot pants
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.720]   Uh
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720]   Say it. I don't know why he had a jewish accent
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.200]   Yeah
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.160]   You
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.160]   Like billy joe
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.680]   Or billy
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.600]   Crystal oh lord and then another thing and another thing
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:25.000]   Google has been pushed to extend the right to be forgotten requests to google.com
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:33.080]   This is this is truly truly appalling. So this is europe saying censor the entirety of the internet including ours
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.320]   If that precedent is set by the way
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:43.960]   What's to say that it ran and china and popes and lots of others don't say you're going to censor the net to my lowest common denominator of freedom
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.800]   This is why this right to be forgotten is so fakta so
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.040]   Part of my lap is so wrong. It's just so wrong and europe is so wrong to think that it should rule the net
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.640]   But but they've seen the problem that you can have the right to be forgotten
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:08.040]   But if it's just forgotten and you know dot br then you just go to dot com and there you are
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:16.440]   As I as I often say about this europe of anywhere on earth should be cautious about the idea of erasing history
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.040]   And telling people what they're not allowed to know for god's sakes
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:25.240]   And now to spread this beyond the borders of europe to tell the rest of the world what we're not allowed to know
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.880]   All I have to say is f u e u
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:33.960]   Got that on t-shirt, but it's good. I like it f u e u
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:39.240]   There's a show title. I think you got a show. Thank you for doing that. It'll save me a lot of time at the end of the show
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:44.680]   It's a little too rippled for the for a trip, but that's all I don't know. I think we could do it
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   I'll think about it. I
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.240]   Mean that's the biggest issue though with the whole right to be forgotten. It sounds like a great idea
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.800]   um, but then who decides?
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.920]   Who has the right to be forgotten and who doesn't right who decides what things deserve to be forgotten?
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.400]   Then you have some sort of
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   antiquated court system deciding
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.800]   This needs to be forgotten, but this doesn't need to be forgotten. It's it's first
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:14.440]   Matthew it's it's they pushed it over to google and now they don't like how google's doing it
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.920]   So they're telling people you have to forget more you're forgetting more places forget forget forget
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.640]   And I have a feeling I don't know this, but I have a feeling that google
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.440]   kind of deliberately
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.440]   You know made it seem more dramatic when it first started forgetting. No, I think a cynical Matthew
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.000]   I don't think they tried to come up with a decision is terrible
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.120]   It is doesn't want to do this. They're gonna do it to the minimum. They have to do it. Of course they are
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.320]   What are they gonna do go at it and be uh aggressive?
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.880]   They you know bring together a
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.440]   Panel of experts to to advise them
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.960]   Uh, they they treated it more far more seriously than I would have treated it. I would have done the absolute minimum
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.080]   I would have tore Peter in every way. They're trying not to and again
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:03.160]   I was just critical of google in all kinds of ways, but I'm not critical among this. I think that's wrong
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:11.720]   Well, I'm sorry. We have a Canadian on for our next story because Canada has a twitter account and it's not sorry
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.040]   Okay
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:21.080]   That's the greatest tweet. I've seen it ages at Canada is a verified account on twitter. So I guess it's actually Canada
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.120]   And
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.960]   This is the tweet at Canada
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.240]   By the way, they know what they're doing. They they started it with a dot
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.400]   Does not apologize for this new twitter account hashtag. Sorry, not sorry
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.640]   Retweeted 3,438 times
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.720]   Favoriteed
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.760]   2,331 times actually make it 2,332 because I'm I'm favorin in this too. What is that all about Matthew and
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.000]   You know it it came as a surprise to me. I saw it
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.440]   Earlier today and I thought I didn't know that I didn't know Canada was on twitter
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.720]   Someone told me they
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.840]   They were sub-tweeting the verge. I gotta check that out
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.400]   Sub-tweeting the verge
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.720]   Yeah, that that sorry not here's the pin here's the pin to eat at the top of their profile. Canada is now on twitter a
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.960]   Yeah, I wish they hadn't gotten with that one. Why why are they perpetuating Canadian stereotypes?
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.800]   Well, especially ones that aren't true like right a lot of Canadians say that no, but it's very popular. Yeah
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.720]   I guess it's self-deprecating, right
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:37.560]   What's great. Yeah, which is great and apparently they want this Simpsons a picture to be the of
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:47.480]   Yeah, a Simpsons kid in a Mountie outfit. This is why I wanted to move to Canada
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.000]   I love a nation that is a fit that has an official sense of humor. Yeah
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.960]   So they've only got a handful of tweets here the first one was
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.120]   At Canada will aim to capture the interest of audiences beyond our borders hashtag digital diplomacy
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:08.840]   Then at Canada will act as a shop window for everything that makes Canada the best country in the world hashtag
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.680]   digital diplomacy and then Canada's is not apologize
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.560]   for this new twitter account
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.920]   and then
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.600]   There's they're saying Ralph wigam should be the profile picture
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.480]   And then
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   Canada's now on twitter a
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.880]   This is just weird. That's great. I love it. You wouldn't I don't know who you think is doing this
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:38.200]   I don't know. I'm I'm trying to find that out right now. It's not is it the prime minister
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:45.400]   Right now. Sorry Matthew couldn't help by the way if you want there of course you couldn't have at Canada with that without
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.040]   at all Canada
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.120]   Which is the French version of it? It's exactly the same
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.360]   There we go. So the verge did something about it and said Canada has just joined twitter
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.200]   And whoever's running it could have said sorry for being late
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.880]   But didn't and so that's that's why at Canada said but the whole thing is kind of humorous
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.360]   By the way, is this the equivalent of a is boy?
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.760]   Oh, Canada a matin also twitter boy
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.600]   That's the a way
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.080]   Why it taking a lot of letters and just making it. Hey, why?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:34.200]   I love it. I love it. I wonder if we'll do have you ever watched at Sweden?
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:40.040]   No, so at at Sweden they periodically it's the official country account periodically
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.640]   They hand it over to just some random Swede who then
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:50.440]   As some are hysterical. This is it a new Swede every week
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.520]   and she as tanya is taking over the
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.840]   Swedish
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   National twitter account right now
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.040]   It's a great idea, but it has backfired
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:10.120]   Sometimes well it's her tag is on being Russian and Sweden sex psychology dancing clothes she wears in student orchestras
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.400]   This you know, I can't imagine even Canada going this
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.440]   No, I mean either. That's a great idea though
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.600]   Wow, that's very egalitarian of Sweden they gave it to someone this was
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:32.920]   Jeez a couple of years ago now who started saying anti-Semitic things. Oh dear. So that was uncomfortable. That didn't work out. Well. Yeah, yeah
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.080]   Do is there a twitter.com/usa
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.200]   And am I gonna get trouble if we go to it? There it is
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.280]   Is there? Yeah, but it's that's not a verified account
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.200]   So it's not really USA
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.160]   Who doesn't love pie?
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.920]   I guess anybody could just set one up. I don't think there's any there's no what are you gonna do?
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.560]   Reserve the country names
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.920]   But I don't know who did it like I don't know if it's a minute to do something. Yeah
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.680]   Somebody I will look into it
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.200]   Somebody did it
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.680]   Well, would you would you would you get on this?
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.120]   In Harper's office. Canada has a twitter account and Matthew Ingram is on it
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:27.880]   Uh, let's let's see is there anything else you guys want to talk about before we go to our
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   picks of the week
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.680]   Samsung galaxy has five only sold 12 million
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.480]   Units kind of a flop for Samsung Samsung's really actually struggling a little bit
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.800]   They do seem to be in the android market
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.440]   All powerful they're gonna take over the phone market and again
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.080]   This is this is well
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.720]   This is part of the story to even google is that is that that kind of power doesn't last forever?
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.360]   Well and ranking and money. I thought Samsung was making billions
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.920]   What happened to that what happened to that?
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:00.520]   And uh jeff and I both have as does Jason howl now we've all got our
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.000]   Nexus you've had at the longest though jeff in fact we did a weird unboxing
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.280]   Last week right after twig because it arrived the two minutes after the show ends
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.120]   I the doorbell rings and there's my nexus. Yeah, I came back on on the on the chat before leo had run off
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.000]   And I and I couldn't get the phone call to work. So I was using my old phone to show opening the new bot phone
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   Well, what do you think should I get one?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.840]   My hat was my my wonderful wonderful car holder thing
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.040]   Uh was too small. Yeah
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.840]   This is the plus size
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   Uh, so I went and got to do one of those
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.120]   Uh, yeah, it's big battery life is fine. I think it's better engineer
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.400]   I mean things like bluetooth it didn't work so well my one plus one are working beautifully
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.800]   So
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.200]   Cameras very good. I think yeah good. Yeah
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.720]   lollipop is uh working well
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.320]   I'll show you
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.560]   Some pictures for I haven't taken a lot of pictures. I've only had it for a few days
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.840]   Uh, it is a what is it 13 megapixels?
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.640]   so yeah, um, let me uh
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.520]   So is it was my criticism with the next four was the camera was just
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.400]   Yeah, well, this is well if that's what you're comparing it to it's much better than that
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:22.440]   The question is how it compares to let's see all photos how it compares to the galaxy note for which is an excellent
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.800]   Uh camera or the droid turbo. It's better than the um
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.760]   Here's a here's a daylight picture. I think the colors are very accurate. The detail is excellent
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.840]   um, I think it's a good camera the camera app is
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:42.760]   Uh, well, here's one thing that it is pure lollipop pure google and it is there many of the mo dox features are not on there
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:49.160]   So, um, that's I mean if you like the the mo dox always listening on all that you can't read change the phrase
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.720]   It has to be okay followed by google
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.360]   Um, oh even when I did that it went off
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.240]   I don't I just kevin toful
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.200]   Our mobile guy was saying he just bought the mo dox
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.640]   and he
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.080]   Because he's gotten so addicted to the mo dole of stuff. Well, I have to the assist stuff
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:15.880]   He uses it all the time, especially in the car or you know, but this is a much better screen a bigger screen
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.920]   Um, here's a comparison of the of the two of the three actually the original mo dox on the left
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.440]   The 2014 mo dox in the middle and you can see how much bigger
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:31.800]   The nexus six is it's it's uh significantly bigger and also lacks some of the beauty of the mo dox design
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.880]   But it's a better battery life. It's 2560 by 1440 screen. So the screen is amazingly
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:44.680]   Uh crisp. I like the real estate. You like the real estate jeff. I mean you're not usually using such a giant phone
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:51.960]   Um, I like it one plus one was it was it's wider than one plus one and takes that little bit of use
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.200]   But my old old eyes, uh, no, I I like it
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.840]   I'm I'm still using my nexus seven when you compare the size of the two pretty close
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.280]   Different no, it's that's big. Yeah, let's see. There we go. Here's a low light photo
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.880]   This will give you as an example. This is in a darkened restaurant. I think it's very good. Yeah, that's pretty good
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.680]   I think it's very good. Mm-hmm. Uh, this is michael's up birthday party in a mexican restaurant
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.440]   Can you put it in your pocket jeff? Yeah, I can
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.280]   Yes, I can't hang out a little more than than a regular phone would but it's as tall as the one plus one was
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.040]   I wish the battery life were as good as the one plus one. That's my only uh, really, but I have have you had a problem yet?
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.680]   Yeah, it doesn't go all day, but I
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:43.000]   I wanted to go from when I unplug and actually by the way having wireless charging is very nice
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.320]   But I wanted to go from when I unplug
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.000]   at um
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.560]   At 7 a.m. To when I go back to bed at 10 or 11 and it doesn't do that. In fact, this is a particularly bad
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.200]   day here, uh
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.720]   I unplugged about 830 and uh, it's supposed to go to midnight
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:06.440]   Um, I guess maybe I'll get I'll get a full day out of it. Yeah, really? I've I never got a full day
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.960]   Yeah, I don't find that yeah, that's that's never gonna pass dinner
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:14.520]   If this went as long as one plus one and if it had I know it gets a pure google experience
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.240]   So it's not gonna have the motostuff, but I love that motostuff
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:25.080]   You know the flipping your wrist to watch the camera and knowing when you're driving knowing when you're sleeping
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.800]   um
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.600]   I can't say he uses he uses the voice
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.680]   Activation all the time. Yeah, and I changed mine to help me obi one Kenobi which
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.920]   meant that it didn't go off by accident. This one goes off right more by accident
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.440]   Yeah, someone sitting next to you can say okay google and well you do okay now one thing lollipop does let you do is
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.480]   Train for your voice. Oh it does okay. Yeah, that's new
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.400]   Um Jason you just got it. So you can't really just got it
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:59.080]   But yeah, I got the uh the white variant which could be why I ordered day one and only just got it this morning. Yeah, um
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.400]   Pretty sure it was the white 64 gig. So this is a 32 gig
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.800]   And uh, it has more free space after the operating system than any other
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.600]   32 gig phone i've used including the moto x's
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:17.320]   So I have had no trouble with lack of space on this at all then there's no card slot no card slot no removal battery
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:24.360]   You know this is kind of I I liken it to the it's the iphone of android phones
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.280]   It's it's kind of pure and beautiful and simple
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:35.800]   Doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it feels elegant and nice in the hand I think and uh, um
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.920]   You know, it's kind of a pure android experience like the iphone might be a pure i always experience not that there's a choice
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   um, I actually um
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.960]   I like the I feel like this is kind of elegant
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.200]   Do like I look at this. I like it. Yeah
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.400]   Yeah
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:57.160]   So with 32 gigs, I think I had 27 free I had a lot
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:04.920]   Which was nice because that means um, you know, I I put audio a lot of audio books on here and some music
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.280]   And I take a lot of pictures. So
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.240]   Anyway, yeah, so we all have our x is six. What do you use right now? A nexus five matthew
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.760]   I've got it to four believe it or not. Yeah, so you're do
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:23.320]   Yeah, I'm definitely do. Yeah, I'm trying to decide the other one to consider is then is truly the galaxy note four
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.480]   Really? Yeah, that's because she says roval with battery and has SD card
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.440]   Really a good arguably the best android camera
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:37.080]   Uh, and um, and they didn't craft it up as much as they have in the past. However, it is not a pure google experience by any
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.040]   Yeah, that's why I went with the nexus. I wanted pure google. I didn't want a lot of crap
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.840]   You should get this. Yeah, or or if you're thinking about the moto x
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.800]   They're actually uh, they announced that they're gonna have a sale on cyber monday through mo roll aside
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:57.720]   Yeah, uh, 140 dollars off an unlocked moto x which brings it like 350 or something like that
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.840]   Which is 350
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.800]   Awesome for that door one penny if you go to verizon and get it subsidized so it's free on verizon
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.680]   basically
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.120]   Are
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.240]   Our picks of the week coming up
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.080]   And just a bit by the way, I fix it gave that a very high repair ability score
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.520]   They said if you can pry it apart the nexus six you need a spudger, but once you get into it
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.240]   It's very something like 18 screws or something
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.600]   21 screws
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.480]   However
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.480]   You know I'd take that over glue any day
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.640]   I really
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.560]   Everybody says you if you want better life get the zoni z3 the experience e3
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.720]   Because it's got a remarkable battery life and it's a 1080p screen. That's part of the reason. Yeah
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:49.480]   I did not like the z2 that much. I'm pretty great things about the z3. I know I might have to get one
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:53.480]   I'd have to get one just to just to test it
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.640]   But that moto x at 350 bucks. That's a good deal
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.560]   Mm-hmm
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:05.000]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books.com of course you hear that conversation that we just had in
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.520]   Microcosm
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:11.320]   Of the full show every Tuesday with Jason howl jina trapani ron richards at
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.640]   5 p.m pacific apm eastern time the fabulous all about and red that's what they talk about the whole yeah for two hours
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:24.280]   And it's still not it's still not long enough actually more like an hour and a half, but yes, you could talk forever
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.320]   Because I am and right is exciting
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.960]   Yeah, it is yeah
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.400]   Fresh books accounting is exciting. This is a cloud accounting solution
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:38.600]   That's from canada. I discovered this amber macarthur told me about it when I was working for rogers
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:44.280]   I was going up there once a month for five days to do a call for help and I had to invoice them
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.160]   in Canadian dollars
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.000]   And I was using microsoft words
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.280]   So kind of I wouldn't invoice them for months at a time and then I'd send them all the invoices at once and they didn't like that very much
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.760]   amber said leo try
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.280]   fresh books
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.120]   Fresh books is the easiest way to invoice clients to organize expenses
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.800]   Can I have to do that too to track your time online?
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:11.960]   And with fresh books award-winning mobile apps you could do it all from anywhere on your android or iOS device
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:16.200]   Fresh books users get paid faster on on average
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.600]   Fresh books customers double their revenue in the first 24 months
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.680]   They're paid an average of five days faster. You might say why is that well
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.440]   I think partly it's because it's easier to invoice to invoice on time and partly because every invoice
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:36.520]   The email invoices have a pay me button that makes it really easy for your clients to pay
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:41.320]   Plus automated late payment reminders eliminate those awkward emails and phone calls, which I like
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.360]   Fresh books integrates with your apps to google apps paypal stripe mail chimp fund box

[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.720]   I am a user and i'm also mike mikdermett the founders an old friend. Oh, I didn't know that super
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.680]   Are they in toronto? Where are they they are? Yeah? Yeah
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:14.360]   He was one of the co-founders of mesh the conference that that i'm involved with up here. I was so happy
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:20.760]   Yeah, I was just really happy when I discovered that was 2005 2006 had been around for a while
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.760]   he he ran it out of his parents basement for about five or six years wow and
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:33.400]   He actually started it. He's an ultimate frisbee player
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.600]   And he started it because he was running ultimate
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.160]   tournaments and he needed a way to
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:45.400]   Invoice and all the ways that he could use were broken. So he just right came up with his own
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.040]   It was actually good because uh the that's the other reason I really liked it. Um
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.520]   I could bill uh rogers and canadian dollars. I know we're still doing that
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.200]   Back up. I could build rogers in the canadian dollars and then my other clients in us dollars
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.440]   They do it multiple currencies makes a big difference
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.720]   It really was a life saver for me
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.040]   Well, good. I didn't know he was a friend of yours. Let me know let me know and i'll email mike him
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.280]   Is he still running it?
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.400]   Yeah
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.640]   It's a big business down like a five million customers
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.280]   It is a big business. It's really great
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.400]   But because they're canadian they're still nice
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.880]   Very nice. Hey, look at him. Is mike in that picture
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.280]   Is mike in that picture?
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.760]   Maybe that's the team the support team though. I be the support team
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.680]   Yeah, I don't think he's not as not
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.800]   You have a great
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.360]   Great space though that i've got it off. Yeah, not in his mom's garage anymore. That's for sure. No
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.480]   Ah
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.360]   Pretty million dollars or something. Yeah. Yeah, it's a it's a it's a really neat story
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.280]   I
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.320]   On golden avenue in toronto ontario canada
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.040]   Jeff Jarvis oh wait a normally
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:58.280]   Yeah, because you got to get out of here. You got a show to go to
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.200]   Google has rented america's biggest billboard for
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.160]   Months in time square and the resolution is
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.120]   2368 by 10,048
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:13.640]   And they put the beat together not the same well. Yeah, it does seem low doesn't it?
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640]   Yeah
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.680]   It's not quite it's a little bit bigger than my phone but not much
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:26.760]   But remember retina depends on how far away you are unless you're standing right next to the billboard you cannot see the pixels
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.640]   So you can also
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.600]   Make your little own android and appear on it. Oh, that's neat
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:38.440]   Which would be fun. I like that's one thing that's kind of fun in times where a lot of those billboards are interactive in some way
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.080]   Yeah, that's nice. That's on the Marriott marquee there
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.280]   So I apologize. I'm gonna run off. Thank you, Jeff
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.600]   Giving to the americans always good to see you Matthew. I apologize for running
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:56.360]   It's snowing you okay. Enjoy your show. Yeah, have a great time jeff jarvis professor of journalism at the city university of new york
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.240]   author of
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.400]   What would google do public parts in his newest?
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.760]   Geeks beware geeks bearing gifts
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:08.200]   Reimagining news just kind of what we were talking about the beginning of the show
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.720]   Really a must read if you're interested in the future of journalism. Thank you very much, jeff
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.200]   Thanks much. Take care
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:19.800]   Matthew, what have you been using anything you want to tell us about lately that you like
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:25.640]   Well, i've actually been using google's inbox for a little while me too
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.200]   Yeah, but
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.760]   Well, I have to say i'm I like it
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.280]   I like it a lot more on mobile than i do on the desktop desktop and maybe that's deliberate
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.160]   I mean, maybe that's kind of what they were going for. It's uh, it's really easy to
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.320]   To swipe through things and and mark a whole bunch of things as done
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.960]   With the check mark, which I really like so
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.600]   No, I don't scroll through
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:59.640]   35 kind of email newslettery things. I just archive them all instantly and I like the ability to pin things and to to set time
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.840]   Um, you know say remind me tomorrow about this thing because I know i'm going to need to know about it
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.280]   But it doesn't have to clutter up your inbox. I think it's
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.120]   I have some issues with the UI. I don't really like
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.080]   the colors and the sort of
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:21.320]   Some of that stuff, but I the functionally I really like it. I feel like it's early early early days on this
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:26.200]   It's the first app that's ever got me to inbox zero ever ever ever
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:33.320]   So for that i'm very grateful see i'm kind of OCD about that. I'm I reach inbox zero all the time
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:39.240]   Not every day, but I I have to uh, actually was talking with krek newmark about this believe it or not
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:45.080]   When I was in san francisco, we had coffee and in he admitted that he was sort of OCD about email as well
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:51.960]   And I I have friends who are the opposite like they have 25 000 that's me messages in their inbox that was me
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:57.080]   And so I I can't even conceive of that it could probably have anything more than
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.720]   A page I start to get anxious
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:03.320]   So inbox is a great way of dealing with it makes it a lot easier
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.440]   I like these previews. You can see them on the screen if you're watching the video that if it's a youtube video
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:13.800]   You can actually play it in the mail. Yeah, um if you want to track a package. You just tap the link
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.640]   If you want to view the map you just tap the link. I find this very
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:23.240]   Yeah, elegant and simple well done. It's a there's a lot missing. I would love to see there's no signatures
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.360]   it's kind of a little bit of a missing piece, but
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.920]   um, you know, there's I would love to see
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.600]   encryption
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:35.320]   Or some sign up some form of signing because I really like to sign you know you do a digital signing in my email
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.080]   So people know it came from me
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:42.520]   A few things like that, but boy, I tell you I think they got the right thing you you can um, you can delay an email
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:48.760]   Till another time, but you can also delay an email to another place. Did you know that is that something they added?
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:56.680]   I didn't know that yeah, so look so here. I'll show you um here's a email from john c de vorak saying I should sue
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.680]   the washington times for their new uh news
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.960]   Podcast because it's tw t
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.640]   Um, so I can snooze this so I click the little
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:14.200]   Clock and I can you know, there's some pre-baked things later today tomorrow next week someday
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:20.040]   That's a getting things done a thing where you just put it off kind of interesting, but you can also pick a pick a place
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.560]   Pick a place so for instance, I could say you know i'm gonna handle that when I get home
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.240]   Right and I could put my home address in there and all this email would disappear
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:33.000]   Until my phone sensed that I was home and then I would say okay, and it would show up again in the inbox. That's very useful. Yeah
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.360]   I feel like uh, I would like to see faster iteration on this
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:44.520]   But I you get the feeling this is a fairly serious enterprise for google so I i'm sure we will see improvements
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.160]   And it's a cool feature. Yeah
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.400]   Isn't that neat? It's kind of like reminders
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.640]   That's another day do go ahead
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:56.040]   Yeah, I was gonna say they do the the sort of sorting is quite good. Yes
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:02.600]   So, you know all travel related stuff is in one that's pretty smart like the the three tabs and gmail
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.880]   I didn't find was granular enough and they've done a good job of kind of categorizing things
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:13.480]   And you can add your own so um I have for instance email from twit as its own mailbox
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.280]   So I can you know go through those very quickly
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.040]   Archiving them instantly. Yeah. Yeah throw them away right away. Yeah
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.880]   um
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.000]   Yeah, I highly recommend it and I think that's getting easier to get
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.280]   Uh, uh invited to it a lot of uh us
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.000]   Inbox users have received new emails
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.520]   New invites I should say um so yeah, I know this I didn't actually get invites
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.200]   for
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:43.480]   I guess maybe they have a time limit where you have to use it a certain amount before you get invites
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:50.200]   Because I I once I got it. I said oh, hey, I let me know if you want me to invite you, but I didn't get invites for about a
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.400]   We have to make sure you're serious. Yeah, exactly
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:00.120]   Had to use it, but I like it. Yeah, very happy with it. Um, I have to say I've gone back
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:06.680]   Uh to using agent and we've mentioned this before and I'm sure you have on all about android
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.080]   But I was saying I don't have the modo x
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.120]   Uh features on my nexus six, but you know
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.680]   Agent adds most of those features and does not seem to hurt the battery life too badly. I
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.680]   I
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.480]   Didn't agent so agent is really great
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.080]   Um
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.960]   On modo x, you know, you know, it's situational awareness
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.760]   So it knows when you're you set your sleep times for instance and it will it will make sure it doesn't disturb you
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.280]   That's the simplest one
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:37.400]   Um, this does something that actually google now does which is records your parking spots based on
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.560]   Um, bluetooth and motion or bluetooth or motion
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.800]   But if you're in a meeting as I am right now and so it'll take your calendar
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.000]   This is what the modo x does it'll refuse calls
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.160]   It'll send a text you have your choices. You can say who can ring you who can vibrate you or you can say if you wish
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.400]   I'll send a text saying i'm in a meeting right now
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.280]   Actually, I say i'm on the air right now, but if it's urgent text me urge the word urgent
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.480]   And then age at the next time you call will let you through
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.240]   Um, it also knows when you're driving and we'll read you texts. This is most of the
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.040]   capability of uh modo x is uh, what do they call call us
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.040]   situational awareness is what I call
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.040]   Um, and I so I like that a lot and agent is built in no
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.000]   No, that's the thing is it is built in the modo x
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.360]   But this will give you a lot of those features and I it also has a nice widget
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.320]   Which I use where if i'm in a meeting I could tap the widget
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:36.680]   Uh, you know if it doesn't know that i'm a meeting a tap the widget and it puts it me in meeting mode message agent
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.240]   We'll continue to run until you manually stop it meeting agent agents. That's agent. It's a free program
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.480]   Somebody told me about I know Jason knows it love it
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:48.120]   It's one of my favorite abs is here for sure and it makes the nexus six a better. I think
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.760]   There's still things missing. I still can't do this
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:57.480]   Um, it I think that's kind of the baseline of stuff from the modo x. I really want
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.400]   Um
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.080]   So highly recommend it
