[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.480]   You know why I say that at the beginning of every darn show so you don't send me an email saying you didn't talk about Google
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.680]   Sometimes we talk about Google. We talk about whatever Jeff Jarvis wants to talk about
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.280]   He's from the City University New York professor of journalism buzz machine.com when you get hosts
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.560]   Like Jeff Edstacey Higginbotham from the IOT podcast on a show
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.480]   You you just let them talk about whatever they're in the mood to talk about it's like it's like the president going off-script
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.900]   That's what this show is. I can't believe you just compared your
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.680]   Self to the president whoa what just happened?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   No, no, no, we're not gonna talk about that although
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100]   Are you burned out yet Jeff?
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.220]   Oh in some ways yeah, but in other ways I was talking about a great conversation and triangulation on Friday with a guy
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.220]   I'm sure you hate he loves you
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.380]   Andrew keen oh
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.420]   Andrews
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.820]   I'll sense it myself. No, I've said to the Andrews face. He's my favorite a-hole
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.900]   He's but he's because he plays that he tries to be he's a baraka tour. He tries so hard
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.020]   It's literally smart. He's funny. He wrote the
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.860]   Cult of the amateur about 10 years ago now, which said the internet
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.460]   It's oh, you know
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.220]   It's you're making a mistake by being so democratic and I to some degree I have to feel like
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.380]   He could take a victory lap now because while you and I and every everybody else are saying you're so wrong
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380]   Yeah, this is the new one how to fix the future
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.180]   So you're so wrong Andrew, you know the the gatekeepers have fallen democracy will rule on the internet. It's gonna be great
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.900]   He was kind of right
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.660]   But now he's got a very optimistic upbeat book. I think I don't have you read it yet or well
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.100]   I haven't I've gone through it so it but but yeah, he'd gone through all the pessimism he had so he had to switch
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.140]   You know, yeah, well he said and I think this is actually very true
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   that
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.820]   There you know, he likened it to the industrial revolution
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.100]   He said when you have these big technological revolutions, there's kind of there are three camps
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.660]   There's the camp that you know, the Luddite camp that says no never
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.220]   Destroy the the looms, you know, we're gonna stick with candles and kerosene
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.620]   Then there's the technologist camp which I think I have for a time to time fallen into which says yeah
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.820]   There's gonna be disruption, but in the end it's it's gonna all be better for everybody because technology will solve all these problems
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.660]   And
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.260]   Then he says you can't fall into either one of those traps
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.820]   You've got to be in the maybe not the yes or the no, but the maybe camp where you acknowledge
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.020]   And I think this is actually of always the reasonable middle you acknowledge
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.660]   Technology's brought us amazing things
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.060]   It's also brought problems and you address the problems in as as difficult as intractable as challenging as they are
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.140]   Yes, you work on them and you solve them and I think that's that's your point of view, right?
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.260]   No, absolutely does then there are problems there are things we've got to do it
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.700]   Just I'm not ready to give up on technology and say oh throw it all out
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.260]   Because that's where I fear we're heading
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.100]   The you know people want to regulate it. They're they're afraid of it
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.740]   And I don't think we're presenting an accurate vision of it. It's the same problem
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.580]   We talked about last week you look at your twitter feed and your facebook feed
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.700]   And it's not filled with Nazis, but if you listen to media you would think the entire internet is nothing but Nazis
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.740]   The problem is one Nazi can just ruin your whole day
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.540]   Well, but that's a media way to look at it
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.260]   That's like you say a Nazi got into the New York Times
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.780]   As opposed to saying oh, there's one nutty Nazi on Times Square Times Square, right?
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.420]   I don't know
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.780]   Stacy's pretty bullish too, right? The problem with us Stacy as technologists is we have to enjoy
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.500]   We we are very aware of the changes
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.940]   Well, not only that um, I think we benefit we put the effort in to benefit from that and celebrate and it's
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.740]   I feel like my parents and I have lots of friends who are totally normal and they help me like
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.500]   They help me guide my enthusiasms to maybe the more mainstream place. So
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.180]   I'm i'm still bullish and I don't think I mean jeff we are having a backlash right now, but
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.100]   It's not like technology is going to go away. It's not like we're all going to suddenly give up facebook or our phones
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.780]   Oh, no, we are we're all moving to viro the new social platform
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.220]   Indeed before before everybody takes it out. So before we get there just so so stacey
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.460]   I just read a book called I think it's the end of liberalism
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.580]   And he basically is trying to get us back and all beyond wish
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.460]   Um, there is there is that that push
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.820]   Yeah, and and i'm sure that like
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.660]   One or two people might go for that, but it's not gonna. I'm worried about it. It doesn't matter. It's not gonna happen
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.060]   I agree. There's no way it can happen. You're both right. You can argue. Let's go back to kerosene lanterns
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.460]   And and leeches and bloodletting
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.860]   But it's not gonna happen
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.780]   So you have to deal with it. I mean technology is a kind of inexorable force
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.340]   Unless you go. I mean, I guess you could create you could you could do what they do in some
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.820]   Uh sharia countries you could you could turn your back on progressive
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.620]   at progressivism and technology, but it's oh, I think it's always temporary
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.660]   That's not so I just another new book. I just thought
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.700]   You like I mean, I mean
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.940]   Doing a lot of research what you want to if you can see this. I saw you showed us you showed us the pile
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.780]   Yeah, the pile of books. I guess that's what makes you a professor
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.540]   The pile that's one of four. He's got CNN on in the background too. Oh, no, no, no, no
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.020]   Um, nichol Wallace msmbc. Oh, that's right. You let you tell me to watch nichol. Yeah
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.340]   Um, then you'll build a coming of post industrial society in the 70s, right?
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.260]   And so we've been we've been we've been scratching our heads about this for quite a while
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.060]   before the net
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.260]   Oh god forever. This is the human condition
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.420]   And I think we'll actually have some interesting things happening as china kind of rises in power in
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.060]   Not in the us versus china, but collectivism versus individualism
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.820]   So I think that'll be that'll be fun
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.220]   Does it trouble you though that uh just this week they announced that they're gonna eliminate term limits for presidency
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.300]   She and they're gonna go
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.540]   That looks like a slide back into
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.900]   authoritarianism my wife was having a fifth of them
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.380]   She didn't see any coverage of it, especially at first there's a little bit more but there was very little coverage up
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.300]   It's like oh, yeah, of course you're doing that
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.540]   it's mal
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.020]   I mean collectivism actually andrew talks a lot about this in his book
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020]   uh
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.260]   It I think it's becoming more and more clear that
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.180]   China has the will to do what we seem in the western democracies to be losing the will to do
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   Which is really invest heavily and things like uh artificial intelligence technologies
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.060]   They're you know, they're they're way out investing in the united states in that um and uh
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.380]   Because they're authoritarian somewhat. I think they're authority. I'm gonna say authoritarian because they're authoritarian. Yeah, you know, there's no
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.620]   There's no debate over whether
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:28.500]   Self-driving cars will either gain mass approval or not there if president. She decides. Yeah. No, I think that's a good thing tomorrow
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.700]   We have self-driving cars
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.380]   So there's certainly and it's always been the case that authoritarianism has certain advantages over uh the
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.100]   the roiling
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.940]   Of politics into the western democracies, but it's a new redoive
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.060]   Start to fight in between amongst themselves. I wonder if we're gonna lose even more momentum
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.860]   Well, that that was the argument of this end of liberalism book is that it liberalism's called to limit
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.100]   That it encouraged freedoms so well that it's broken itself. I don't agree of course at all. That's not I could
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.820]   So let me read john do we john do we quotes carlyle
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.780]   Uh carlyle was don't admire democracy, but in a lucid moment. He said invent the pre-impress and democracy is inevitable
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:17.940]   Do he says add to this invent the railways the telephone mass manufacturing and concentration of population urban centers
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:25.780]   And some form of democratic government is humanly speaking inevitable. I kind of agree. I kind of invent the internet. Yeah, and the
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.780]   The globally connected world. Yeah, what's inevitable?
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.900]   I also comes out of reasons. I'm not a fan of sanctions. I know sanctions are one of the few ways
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:42.580]   Nations can punish other nations, but I look at north korea is isolating north korea the best way to encourage democracy in north korea
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.660]   I would I would argue exactly the opposite
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.700]   Um invite uh north, you know, I think the people are sending usb
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.140]   Drives usb keys into north korea with a western programming are probably doing more to bring down
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.260]   Kim jong yield Kim jong on then uh, then our sanctions are frankly
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.980]   And sanctions just published i don't know how we got into this sanctions just punished people
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.340]   They don't publish but they don't publish kim a punish kim
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.220]   Because he's gonna he has access to all the resources of the country. He doesn't have to worry about it
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:19.860]   Um, they punish the normal people so I don't know that's that's that's another topic for him
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.260]   What about viro though really so above euro. Sorry
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.260]   No, I i'm like i'm like, how did we get into this that I am woefully under un unprepared for
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260]   Oh, you have a you have brains you can you can talk about this
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.980]   So viro is all the rage all of a sudden what happened
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.940]   It just it hit critical mass, right?
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   What was I in german when this happened? I I feel like it happened. Yes, i missed it
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.060]   Yeah, exactly
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.740]   And then on the rundown today there's a movement to get everybody to uninstall viro already
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.380]   Yeah, I didn't even install it and they're already telling me not installed so it's a new social network created
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.860]   By an israeli. I believe who
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:05.940]   Some people say has a checkered past not not in a criminal way, but just uh, you know having a failed startup and not paying
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:11.300]   The employees or something like that. It's also evidently very hard to kill your account
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.420]   Yeah, i'm sure there's these other plates. Yeah
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.100]   Um due to
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.220]   And and and one of the reasons that it's coming to the news is because all of a sudden this is really interesting
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.580]   It's that hockey stick
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.180]   It's been putting along for six months or so and then suddenly something happened and it turned the hockey stick and
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.300]   Exponential growth bringing their servers down
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.860]   Um, and uh, you know, they apologize. We're experiencing higher than normal load. We're working in reserman normal service
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.140]   I kind of I so I downloaded it reading about it and I I kind of like it. It's very media focused right
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.220]   So when you press the ad button and by the way, it's only uh, ios
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:55.060]   In android it is no desktop version when you press the ad button you can create a post but it focuses on content
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   So camera link music movie tv book or place
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.060]   There's nowhere to just say type of a text message
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.340]   Uh, and when you when you pick book
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.780]   It actually goes through the top books on ibooks
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.420]   But you can also do a search. So what was the name of your book? Uh jeff so I can
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.380]   No, it's not gonna be in there
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.580]   Oh, I mean, oh let's let's do enter king. Okay, how to fix the future how to fix
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.900]   The i'll just start the search there see if it pops up with androids uh how to fix a broken heart
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.380]   Actually, that might be more useful how to fix the future. Let's try that
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.900]   Yeah, there it is androkene so you press that it puts a big
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.100]   Picture of the book on there
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.420]   Uh, you have choices of buttons reading want to read recommend don't recommend
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.940]   So let me do recommend now you can put some text in
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.980]   just
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.660]   talked
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.700]   to
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.700]   andro
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.940]   On twig I guess i'll say
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.220]   Oh, no, it was triangulation right triangulation
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.940]   This is twig
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.300]   Triangulation and i'll just leave it at that you can't as far as i tell edit it now. This is also interesting
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.460]   You when you follow people or you people follow you you can categorize them
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.260]   So you can um you can
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.460]   Oops, let's do it again. You can choose this pretty complicated
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.420]   Well, no once you do it, maybe maybe we need complication to get quality once you do it
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:31.540]   It's pretty quick so you choose close friends or you can extend it to close friends and friends close friends friends and acquaintances public
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:38.100]   So that's that's a clearer you I yeah very straightforward. Yep. It shows you below who that will be
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.780]   So i'm gonna share it with everybody who follows me is public, right?
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.260]   Uh, you can also this is interesting. There's a facebook and twitter button
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.140]   So if you want to add your facebook and twitter but post uh
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.060]   links
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.660]   Then it would be a central place for you to post to all three networks
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:03.380]   And then you post it and so as a result of that focus on content. I'm sorry about the glare. I gotta keep it notches so stupid
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.860]   Sorry
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:13.540]   Um, you get a lot of the the stuff that's in here is a lot of photographers a lot of book and tv show recommendations
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.780]   It I think it's kind of pretty courage is something different. Yeah
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.460]   I don't know. I kind of like this now
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.620]   There may be uh, you know larger issues that aren't apparent from just looking at
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.420]   I mean the first issue of course is the issue any new social networks suffers from which is
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.620]   none of your friends are on it so
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.220]   But then the but then the on the other side
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.100]   Nobody's but no nazis
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.580]   So that's good yet
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.700]   And then uh, and there's a way by the way you can have comments
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.540]   So it's it's got a little google plus it's got threaded comments as well. Like let me find one with a lot of comments
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   So I can show you
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.940]   Um, so this is a little bit google plusy right a comment section
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.860]   The only thing I don't know about is the guy the company
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.380]   This the policy the service policy all of that stuff
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:15.460]   Well, it sounds like it's that the daily beast did some reporting on the guy the ceo
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.580]   Not
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   Yeah, not great
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.580]   You could
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.100]   Let me pull it up
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.060]   See this is the problem. I mean you're that's the the yeah
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:35.300]   Cori to a 2016 report from roiters details of how migrant construction workers were abandoned in desert camps without paying basic resources
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.020]   It's like from a company called saudi oger
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.380]   Uh in a statement. He said he wasn't involved in the company effort 2013
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.100]   All right
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.820]   So who knows
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.820]   I think his moto pointed out that hold on. Let me just double check
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:58.260]   There's also, uh, if you read the terms people are saying oh, they're overreaching terms
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.260]   But I don't think they're so much different than the terms of instagram and face say that you own your stuff
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.820]   Uh, you can't directly delete an account. You have to request deletion
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.980]   Here's gizmodos. We regret to inform you that viro is bad
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.620]   so there
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.340]   Their update is that the daily beast
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:22.100]   Uh, the ceo said the viro folks said that the daily beast was inaccurate
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.500]   However, the only source to say that the ceo
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:32.020]   Had left that saudi over firm in december 2013 was
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:38.580]   The ceo's own wicket pedia page which had been edited anonymously to include this information as of yesterday
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.580]   It was his family's uh construction company
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.660]   He was the deputy chief executive officer and vice chairman
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.020]   Uh, yes, saudi oger
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.580]   Was the source of most of his family? It's a terrible name. I'll be oger
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:00.180]   Might be I don't know probably means something different gift. Jeff oger. Oh, jur. Yeah, it's hard
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.700]   Um, 31,000 complaints of nonpayment for wages filed against the company
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.300]   Soudy government stepped in to provide food and basic living supplies. I have to point out that this happens all the time in do buy as well
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.140]   I mean, this is kind of a
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.700]   So I don't know does it know? Well, that's an interesting question
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.500]   Uh, should you not use a social network because the guy who started it has a bad track record
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:26.340]   Um, it depends on how bad it is. Is it
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:33.460]   Abandoning people immigrants in the middle of the desert to start to death bad? Is it broad com sceo sex dungeon bad? Right? Is it
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:41.060]   Okay, I mean jeff won't even buy a basketball from dex sporting goods where he wouldn't until now so
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.100]   Oh, well, I mean
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:51.300]   It's our society. Let's you make these calls yourself. You can say, huh, you know, I'd prefer not to do business with
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.060]   What if this okay? This is interesting. So what if the software is really good?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.980]   Right, um
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.860]   There is a company in town that makes amazing frozen foods
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.460]   Ersen Italian foods and they had a history of fines with osha
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.100]   And their workers losing limbs and their manufacturing plants. Okay, but that's so I said no
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.580]   Yeah, don't buy from that company because that's what you don't want, but this was the food was delicious
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:25.780]   Yeah, but I don't want to buy food from a company that limbs are being lost in so that's but this is that was this guy's company
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.700]   before
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.820]   Nobody's asserting that viro doesn't pay its employees or or is leaving people into the star of in the desert
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:39.700]   And maybe and there is some question mark whether this what what harari harry had to do with it. I don't know
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.900]   Um, I the CEO of this company should he start another food company. I would not support it
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:54.100]   Okay, that makes sense because I think I think a district a casual disregard for human life is you know
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.980]   Okay, well, but the problem is it's everybody has so so alie velshi today
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.660]   Had a really good discussion with scott galloway and and stuff any rule author of the floor
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:12.740]   uh, yes, uh about uh the dicks move and um dicks we should say for those who are not paying attention
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.460]   Dicks sporting goods, which through a subsidiary or a resident
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:23.700]   Store called field and stream was selling caravas to I think yeah assault rifles kabellis kabellis
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.260]   Caravas is a razor restaurant. Yes, you get pasta there. You get bullets at there. Yes, sorry. So dicks
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.740]   Which continues to sell firearms because it's a sporting goods store
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:40.900]   Uh has decided not to sell uh ar-15s or assault weapons of a kind
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.580]   And uh as a result raise the age of 21
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   On any gun sales to sell no high volume
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.220]   magazines and this is actually the part of a really kind of to me surprising
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.980]   National move against the nra I finding this very interesting because did you watch the the the
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:04.420]   Presidential meeting that was on an hour ago. No, I'm busy. I'm working. Oh, it was I
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.700]   So it was phenomenal
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.260]   It was it was one of those things where he did the public thing with members of congress from both parties
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.940]   Yeah, it has a chat. Yeah, and so what you see
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.100]   Hope hicks or somebody has decided this is this is the best way to showcase the press
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.100]   Well, she's gone now so that'll change she's gone
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.980]   Show. Yeah, she just she just
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.180]   Got a watch more tv because she admitted she was she lied
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:36.420]   White white lies white lies white lies white lies purple lies blue lies lies
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.820]   um
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.820]   so
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:48.740]   Anyway, let's just do Dick's sporting goods because I don't need it. We don't need to get this stack goes all the way down
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.540]   Turtles all the way down
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:57.940]   Turtles on the show turtles turtles and what there is there is this move a foot which is very interesting given how we've you know went through
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.420]   so many
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   horrific
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.020]   Mass murders that all of a sudden this is the one and maybe it's the kids at part one
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.500]   It probably is right but people have just said we're gonna we're you know, we've had enough
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220]   because it's
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:20.100]   Go ahead. I was gonna say it's the largest and then also there was a really interesting graphic showing how when columbine happened
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.580]   Columbine happened
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.900]   The age of people who were affected by that are now of an age where
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:33.300]   So they call it the columbine generation. So if you google that I mean
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:40.100]   There's also a huge political I think there's both an effort to find things we can agree on
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.260]   in 83, I think percent of the us
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.500]   Supports some basic forms of you know banning assault rifles
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:54.580]   Raising limits like there there are some basic rules about gun control that most americans support
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.860]   So and then you've got these charismatic kids who
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.220]   My god, the media is listening to them. They're putting them everywhere in I think that's got to be it right
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:09.620]   It is and let us let us say again. This is the generation supposedly ruined by the internet apathetic
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:17.460]   Unable to put a sentence together and instead they lived in media and they know how to be on media and they're being just absolutely brilliant. I think
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.180]   That's a very good point jeff
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:27.060]   The internet beat them who they are, you know, and in some to some extent their parents did too their schools did too
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.380]   but it didn't ruin them and
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:38.100]   And it taught them how to be able to talk this way in some measure they've been using social media just brilliantly
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:46.020]   I didn't realize this but dicks had removed uh, salt style rifles from their dicks sporting stores after the sandy hook massacre
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:52.340]   But now they've also removed them from the sale at the 35 field and stream stores. This is from dicks statement
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   Okay, let's get it. I was a little confused because I was trying to remember
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:03.060]   The last time I've been in a dicks and did I see well we have a big one here and it's the it's these sporting goods store in town
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.020]   It's funny because jeff tweeted this came up because jeff tweeted
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:12.660]   I would like to buy a basketball from dicks, but I don't need one and then i don't play basketball the mega moroni
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:18.260]   Immediately did she went and bought one. She said I do need one man just to give the full credit here
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.820]   So then someone named uh brooks grigson
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.260]   Said why don't you buy the basketball since you're such a clots and you don't play basketball on your own buy it and give it to a school
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.900]   That needs it. Good. I said brilliant idea
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.540]   So I I tweeted why I wish donors choose would let you do that and sure enough donors choose comes back
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.140]   And if you search on on this and you can look at my twitter feed and it's in there
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.060]   You can
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:48.020]   There are schools that ask for things to be bought at at dicks and by the way dicks doesn't
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.740]   One for one match. Oh, that's neat. So I you get two schools
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:58.500]   I bought you know who wanted basketballs and stuff and I donated some and and dicks
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.780]   Probably make a profit on this, but it supports
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.540]   What they did it supports the schools at the same time. So thank you brooks grigson
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.660]   Megan was telling me that boycots according to
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.740]   uh freconomics don't succeed nearly as well as
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.540]   The opposite what you're doing, which is supporting a company by patronizing it
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.420]   Yeah, let's look at what sticks sports, uh
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.900]   Dicks a big healthy healthy. You're gonna look at their Oh, yes. They are. Oh, yeah
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.620]   Do they actually own cabela's?
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.780]   I thought I saw that but I could be wrong. It was something was going past by my real quickly
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.740]   So there are 22 cents a day. So it did this did not
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.780]   That's not a huge knock them down at all. Yeah
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.060]   Well, there will be a backlash right they'll also be
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.500]   This is actually an interesting well. This is where you get the georgia and and delta
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.780]   Right, um where delta having pulled and all all these companies did was pulled their group discount plan from nra members
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.340]   It's not a big deal, but the symbolic and the parkland teens got it to happen
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.940]   and
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.260]   So when delta his background did that the lieutenant governor of georgia
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.420]   Pushed through and I think a senate indeed didn't pass
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:19.460]   A fuel tax benefit that was gonna benefit delta in georgia. So they got politically punished
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.940]   for not
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.380]   Siding with the nra. This is from the side of the house that should be in favor of leaving business alone
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.780]   But to bring this back to tech
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.420]   There's a well, but no, but I think there's very much a tech angle on this
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:39.700]   I think you said one thing which is that these kids in parkland grew up as a generation of
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:46.660]   You know a digital native generation and they were able to take advantage of these technologies including mainstream media
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:53.620]   To get the word out that things like donors choose make it possible for you and others to participate in this and frankly
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.220]   I think companies
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.780]   like dicks and uh all the other companies
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:04.820]   May have been less quick to act if it didn't if it weren't for twitter and social media. Oh, yes
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:12.100]   A to feel the pressure but B to get the word out that they they did it. He just made yeah, you get the credit. I think yeah
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:18.340]   Um, so I so earlier I was saying that alley velshy was on his show with scott kelaway. That's what led us back to this
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:23.060]   Oh, yes, and you know, he said he said it was wife. So is who amazon or or
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.700]   What was it? Um, the amazon is still on bright bar and amazon this and amazon that he said well
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.460]   What if you and amazon? I guess um still has it steel with the nra so i'll stop amazon
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:42.020]   What are you gonna do is it his wife? Well, you're a walmart and the wife said well walmart sells guns. Yeah, so you know you you know
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.020]   One is pure
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.940]   And and and running the world on single issues isn't gonna work very well
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.020]   We've got to be smarter than that
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:56.020]   But you do have a power on these and these teenagers from parkland prove the power that you have
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.060]   It's not we don't give up on democracy dammit
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.340]   The internet's enabling it dammit and it's not full of nazis dammit right on
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.460]   who right on
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:13.460]   Meanwhile you could go out and spend $259 if $249 on a crappy camera from google
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.500]   What is it? Hey?
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.060]   So it's getting smashed in the reviews, but I
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.780]   Okay, here's here's what I think it's not totally ready for mainstream
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:30.420]   But I actually surprisingly thought farhan manju had a good point about adding intelligence to cameras
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.260]   and letting
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.500]   Cameras start making these judgments
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.580]   What's the clip does it's the it's a camera that
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:45.940]   You put somewhere and you let it take pictures you then put those pictures on your phone and it's it's choosing right?
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.100]   It chooses it. I mean there is a button where you can press it
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:57.700]   But it chooses it it basically is like hey, this looks like a good moment to photograph and then takes a picture what I think is
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:04.660]   Art is always defined by technology. It starts out defined by our technology, right?
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.860]   So we had these wonderful portraits of people sitting very still in formal, you know, because that's
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.340]   Yeah
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.460]   And looking at some of the pictures people have posted especially of their kids. I'm like
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:24.500]   Yeah, this is not a traditional photograph that I would ever compose, but some of the moments are worth keeping and I think
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.540]   We should really good point of mind
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.500]   Farhan took it to disneyland
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.300]   And didn't take any photos
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.420]   For over two days, but had the clips do the work and he says here's a clip of my son driving car
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.260]   He wouldn't have taken but clip stood now. I have to point out the quality potato quality
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.260]   It's terrible, but yes
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:50.180]   And so that's disappointing because you might get great pictures or great. It looks like these are like little animated gifts, but
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.140]   You're if the quality is terrible, which it is kind of disappointing
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.820]   Some of them, but like look at these kids dancing. I mean
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.660]   The quality like the framing and composition
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.940]   Google can fix that that's that's a software update
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.140]   Better camera in here too. Obviously. I mean this they they make a really excellent camera for their pixels
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.540]   So there's no reason they couldn't have a better camera in here, but it's kind of like you're finding memories
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:24.260]   Also perspectives Stacy we were the very first google glass came out and people had they were swinging their kids around and you can see the face
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.860]   As if you were doing it it changed perspective you weren't having to hold the camera
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.780]   Yeah, I think you're right
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.100]   So I I don't know. I mean, yes, I'm ready for purchase though
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:40.900]   Yeah, I wouldn't go or google leo you bought one right? No, I was gonna win an after reading all these negative reviews
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.660]   I thought I don't first of all the reviews are done. I think that I don't need to I don't need to add on to that
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.180]   It's it's if there were a better camera and I would I would come back
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.220]   I think it's a first attempt at something that will be interesting
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.860]   But at this point I don't I don't want to spend money on that because it doesn't look like something
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.420]   Anybody needs any more information about do you do you feel like you'd like to know what I think about this?
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   No, no, I
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.140]   Let's talk about a wasting money. I think we know enough. I wasted a thousand dollars this morning
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.180]   Buying a windows on arm the first windows on arm
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.740]   Device from hp. Oh, wow
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.940]   That you know that is going to be a question it was certainly questionable price the hp nv2
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.900]   But I think that that's an example of something where we really have to
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.420]   We have to take a look at it because this is a this is a genre of computing that is new
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   This is a LTE enabled
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.060]   Qualcomm 835 based
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:42.820]   Portable from hp at which at 600 bucks would be very interesting, but unfortunately they're charging a thousand dollars for it
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.540]   But they say 22 hours
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.620]   Uh on a battery charge, which would be quite interesting
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.820]   God it's been so long since we've been I feel like we've been talking about this. It's like
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:01.300]   I know wow finally. Okay. Yeah. Well, and it may not be finally just like the clips that I bought the clips when you know
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.140]   I did I tried to buy it when I first got the invite to try to buy it and they said, oh, no
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.580]   You can't get it yet and thank god because I would have one right now if I had been able to
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.820]   I was you could just give it to me. I was a parent. I'm kind of interested
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:22.020]   Yeah, I always thought I'd be interested in it. Yeah, well, we have you know far had also mentioned one of our sponsors lighthouse in his article
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:28.980]   Uh, and I and that's I think and you're the one who told me about lighthouse and I think that's very a similar idea a camera
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:35.060]   That only takes pictures when something of interest happens and then sends you a notification in this case
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.500]   It's a home security device, but I think that's also very interesting
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.540]   I like the idea of ai in these cameras as long as you can trust your you know your privacy
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:51.140]   Well, there's the privacy and so there this is what far had was getting at is there's the privacy aspect with the vendors
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.820]   but there's also
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:32:00.180]   the privacy aspect now that these cameras have the ability to alert a human the ability the cameras have the ability to make
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.860]   Human judgments and then alert people right and beforehand
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:12.740]   People just didn't have the scale of you know computers can scale out crazily. Yeah, so that it's a little disturbing
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.420]   I'll be honest. I'm like you could have if you had a jerk boss, you know
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.820]   And let's say I work, you know in a building not at my house
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.020]   You know, tell me every time stacey comes in late
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.540]   Pat or tell me every time stacey comes in past 8 o'clock
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:33.220]   I am that jerk boss because we had cameras in our old studio that had microphones on them. They were dropcams
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.260]   We'll remember that was a problem
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:42.980]   John's saying no, we didn't but initially when we first set them up. We were recording audio until we got some strong
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.180]   advice from ployees
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   California I'd pick oh
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:56.580]   Yeah, because did you see there was one thing to pick up what's going on in the public space our studio another thing entirely to pick up conversations
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.540]   Yeah, that's that's creepy
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.980]   Um, did you see the information just published this story?
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:09.060]   And so I put it on the rundown because I thought it was interesting that google's and talks with construction companies to build apartments
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.620]   For its staff
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   Let's talk about surveillance and employees or employers crossing the line. Let's talk about this. Well, these would be
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.700]   on campus
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.740]   Yeah
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.260]   Nearly 10,000 apartments. Well, this is just a natural evolution
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.100]   I mean really these companies microsoft started this with their campus in redman
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.660]   They would hire guys at a kids at a college
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:40.980]   And they would make it look like a college campus and give you all sorts of incentive never to leave including dry cleaning food
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.940]   Baby sitting whatever you needed and now this is just the logical next step and might as well put some buildings
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:53.140]   Apartments in there so you really don't have to ever go go home for somebody who who commutes basically an hour of 45 each way minimum
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.580]   I'd love that. Yeah, I'd love it fox con does this
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.380]   If you work at the fox yeah, it's a city. Yeah
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.940]   Yeah, but that's that's part of china and they're out there to authoritarian
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.980]   Well, I mean here's an interesting side note
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.300]   Katera the company there at google's talking to about doing this has a significant investment from fox con
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:20.260]   Done it's prefab it's prefab housing that makes sense if you're in the fabrication business
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.900]   I can see if you're young you don't have a family
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.340]   Yeah, this would be fantastic and this is
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:33.460]   But it is like who have a starting job. It's it's prohibitive. You can't live if anywhere near there remember the tenon seerney ford song, right?
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.460]   Yeah
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.740]   Oh my god
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:47.620]   Because in in you know if you were coal miner you lived in housing subsidized by the company you had to buy
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.940]   You didn't get paid you got chits that were only good at the company store
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:56.260]   Uh, they would lend you so he owed his soul because they would give you food
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.740]   But now I have to continue to work here forever because I have to pay them back
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   I'll
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.700]   That is that is similar in the sense of what happens if you're living in this google apartment space
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.740]   And then you decide you want to leave google or you're fired like what kind of right now you have
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.180]   30 my job and my apartment
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.740]   Yeah, see that would be terrible
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.900]   But nobody was happening at my house. Nobody your age
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:30.100]   Nobody that age thinks omele is my job. They don't think that oh my god
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:35.220]   I think they all think that oh do they uh, they're like they're one of the most economically insecure
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:43.460]   Generations. Yeah, you're right and they they don't they don't have any illusions of businesses being loyal to them. All right. No, you're absolutely right
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:51.220]   Hmm. This is so in a way. This is the uh, the the company store back again
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.820]   A very interesting I just was like oh look hello dystopia
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.940]   Amazon buys our sponsor the ring video
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:08.980]   At least that's the up it might be more more. We don't know because nobody's yeah
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.260]   I was just a little bit
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.780]   Oh
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:21.060]   I don't know they raised 200 and 10 million dollars over the last six years. So okay
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.740]   and I love there's gotta be people posted immediately on twitter the
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.180]   the video of jamie jamie
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.980]   The founder pitching
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.660]   Was it is it zowinski pitching his video doorbell to the shark tank people who turned him down
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:43.540]   Turn him down. Yeah, they turned him down with reason that doorbell the doorbought doorbell was a piece of crap
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.860]   Yeah, but they could have had a chunk of ring
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:52.500]   And no one takes the shark tank deals my friends who are on shark tank are like don't do it. It's terrible terms
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.340]   It's a terrible deal. Yeah
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.700]   so but I know I show it to my students how to pitch
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.580]   Oh
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:09.540]   Amazon's second biggest acquisition ever according to recode between 1.2 and 1.8 billion
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.580]   Yeah, because zappos was 1.2
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:18.500]   So that's if that's true and it could be in ihs was saying
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.620]   Whole Foods is 13.7. Yeah, it was billion. It was the biggest by far
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.500]   So this would be number two only second only to the whole foods acquisition
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:34.420]   So it's funny because Amazon actually create that we talked about this story. They they talk to august
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.540]   I think you like the august right you weren't here that week when we talked about um august doorbell
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.020]   I don't like the doorbell. Oh you not doorbell locks
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.580]   The locks are fine. Yeah, they talked to august
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.460]   uh and then uh walked away from that deal and created amazon key
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.700]   Right, which was the uh thing that nobody should ever do
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.100]   Which allows the amazon delivery person to walk into your house put the
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.260]   Package in your house and leave and there's a camera and then there's a lock associated
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.100]   Uh, so they developed that and that was a so long ago. That was a few months ago
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.100]   And now they bought ring
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.340]   But ring doesn't make door locks, but they do make
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:15.460]   Cameras they make doorbells. They make security lights with cameras
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.740]   And one day if they get over their ADT lawsuit, they may sell a security system. That's right
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.980]   They had a home security system that ADT stopped
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.780]   Stymied with a lawsuit
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.820]   Uh interesting
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.700]   Uh clearly this has to do with well, I don't know what this has to do with
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:42.500]   Clearly, I don't know what i'm talking about. If you haven't explained it to you. I can even tie it back to google if please
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:49.140]   Please okay, I wrote about this actually last night and I took my normally I do not cover news
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:54.660]   But this was big enough and I was like, yeah, I know what this is about so what's happening is
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:39:00.500]   Security home security has been like the killer app for the internet of things
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.180]   We all thought it was gonna be home automation, but it's not definitely home security
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.900]   So that's smart doorbells is one of those right?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.780]   Yeah smart doorbells smart cameras all of that are the big winners. So what's happened is
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.700]   the
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.700]   the market it's it's
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.660]   Basically for the last year or so it's been a bloodbath
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.980]   You're either going to win big or you're going to die or you're going to get acquired
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.420]   So everybody's trying to get acquired ring was out raising money
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:33.380]   Amazon saw what they could do after with the lex after having a lexin all the success in the smart home
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.340]   They're like, well, shoot this space is probably pretty good for us
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.660]   We should get in on that
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.940]   and so
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.020]   The blink by gets them the technology the video processing technology
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:51.540]   At low powers. It's really important for them ring is going to get the market share ihs says they're about 1.2
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.660]   Million ring doorbells out there. It's by far the largest
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:00.340]   Video doorbell company with 45 percent of the market. I'd like to take full responsibility for this. Yes. You should you should yes
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:06.340]   I should also note ring is actually a sponsor of my show. There you go. So we both can take responsibility
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.540]   So well, no, I'm just noting because i'm talking about it
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.340]   All those
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.340]   Ethics I won't take responsibility for it, but you should Leo your audience is much bigger
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.500]   I think we pushed a lot of doorbells out the door
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.260]   There you go
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.260]   Um, and they've been on for two years. Yeah, yeah
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:31.140]   So so yeah, so ring basically now has the technology for a credible video system
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:38.420]   And it has the market power and reach in ring for a long time was not
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.940]   Uh
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.260]   It's it's doorbells. They don't make a lot of money on them if they make anything
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.020]   So
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:56.260]   That that's the other thing. I think getting a new video processor like the blink video processor in there and having amazon's cloud kind of
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.140]   Capabilities should help it cut down on its
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.020]   Material that would make a lot of sense actually that there's a synergy there that amazon could bring to the table
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.460]   Right that would be very interesting and after all echo
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.660]   And ring have been worked together for some time. So
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:16.500]   Um, yeah, that may okay. That all makes sense. I don't make oh they are saying that ring and adt settled
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.020]   Apparently
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.180]   One person one source says for 25 million, which is twice what ring were offered
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.060]   This is some of the bezos money. I would guess because after all if you're going to acquire a company you don't want them
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.180]   I hobbled by lawsuits. So yeah, what I settled
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:38.980]   And see yes, I heard they were very close to settling but again, and I heard that from multiple sources. Well adt
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.700]   Accomplish what it wanted to
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.780]   Which was keep them out of the christmas. Yeah with the holiday buying season. So
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.140]   uh, yeah
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.540]   Jason calicanis says the biggest loser in amazon ring deal is alarm company adt
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.340]   so there I think the biggest loser is going to be all of the
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.740]   It's actually probably going to be us or anybody who buys into
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:08.020]   Who wanted multiple ecosystems because what we're seeing is a google ecosystem
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:15.700]   Amazon yep, amazon ecosystem. Maybe an apple. That makes me very sad. Well apple pioneered the whole idea and apple
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.580]   Of ecosystem plays. Oh
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.140]   Is like smart homes not of smart homes. No, but an ecosystem plays apple more than any company
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.500]   one of the reasons apple is so valuable is because they were able to
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.340]   Create an ecosystem and they've been
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.460]   I mean really nasty about keeping others out of that ecosystem. They they want to own it 100%
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:44.420]   and uh, in fact, you know, it tunes for windows is about the only chink in that armor out there and uh,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.700]   So
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:50.500]   You got to look at that and say well that worked pretty well and i'm sure that that's exactly what amazon and google are looking at
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.780]   It's bad for consumers consumers like you as stacey want every one on a heterogeneous system
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:02.900]   I think in the end I think it'll be better for the industry if there's heterogeneous systems just because
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.380]   Well, there could be any more companies. Yeah, more companies will develop for it, etc, etc
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.740]   But also
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.460]   Look at now what happens if you're skybell or if you're another canary or
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.580]   Are your nest cameras going to continue to work on your you know amazon?
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:25.060]   Or whatever your ring stuff continue to work on like the upcoming google screen efforts
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:32.660]   No home screen depth. What's unknown? I mean amazon bought audible as well and has not changed anything about audible as far as i can tell
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:40.020]   So what's unknown is how much amazon will change rings? Yeah, business. They say right now. So the sources in
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:47.940]   Sorry, so the sources in the industry say that ring is going to run it like zappos or audible right zappos is a really good example
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.540]   Yeah, but I would say audible zappos is quite independent
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:59.140]   Um, I think that audible got a lot of marketing advantages obviously from amazon
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.980]   Right there. Yes marketing and billing it's much. It's it's so seamless now
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.540]   That i'm doing both audible is not a hardware maker. So that's easy
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.820]   Uh, yes, uh, so if you sell shoes
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.380]   Uh that's different if you make doorbells, that's different. Um, yeah, right
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.980]   Yes zappos can even do it's crazy. What is it the hella helio?
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.540]   Talker see what is that what do they call that?
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:30.980]   Their banishment style. Oh, yeah, um, uh, um
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.220]   whatever that is
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.540]   Not at all like amazon
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.860]   Management's a gold chat room. I'll just google it
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.940]   Helio talker see
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:52.340]   Uh, you'd think google chat room has no comment. They're googling it too. They just faster googlers than we are. That's all
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   That's what that's we that's um
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.100]   Human google i've seen that word once hollocracy
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.660]   Hollocracy or holocracy
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.300]   Holli h o l a
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.220]   Yeah, hollocracy. Yeah, hollocracy. What sounds right? Yeah
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.620]   Katie Couric is no longer at yahoo and now we know why
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.020]   She says
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:17.860]   They treated they hired all these famous big names and they treated us like we were in the witness protection program
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:26.020]   It is funny. Uh, this was a joint interview with kara swisher recode and katie kirk's own podcast
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.180]   Uh, she said i don't think that you know she said
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.660]   During her tenure yahoo kirk sought to do the high quality journalism
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:41.140]   Rather than the low rent stories yahoo was best known for at the time which she likened to the boy who lived on ramen noodles for 13 years
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:48.340]   You won't believe what happened next she said marissa mire was open to these aspirations, but didn't follow through
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.140]   I don't think she ever understood the commitment that would take kirk said I think she had a lot of other things on her plate
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.700]   In fairness, I wouldn't say it was an unhappy marriage, but it was certainly was not fulfilling for me
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.420]   I had all this great content. I was getting big interviews and it was sort of like a tree falling in the forest
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:07.060]   They didn't put it on the front page or they didn't know how to even now. Yep. They don't have very good distribution
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.220]   They really don't know how to market things properly. They didn't know how to tie a quality and make it scalable
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.660]   And coffee with katie before she went there and she really was gonna try to rethink
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.780]   video news and was open to all that and she had a very smart staff and um
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:28.180]   Yeah, nothing really much came of it. She is a wordsmith. Listen to this quote. She's good. She's really good
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:34.740]   These tech companies are not media companies. They do not care about stories about content about true connection
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:42.020]   I think they care about widgets and gadgets and delivery systems, but they aren't super interested in the vegetable soup that's running through the pipes
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:49.860]   I think the secret sauce is people who are technologically savvy, but also respect and care about storytelling
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.980]   The company that combines those two things is going to win the day. I haven't really found it yet katie
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.740]   I've got a thousand dollar check in my pocket that says you belong a twit
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:06.900]   Should we try to get katie on the show? Yeah, you could you know her? I'll ask her. Yeah, I'll ask
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.940]   She has her own podcast
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.580]   But somebody else I was gonna ask and I forgot to tell you what I was asking so i forgot to have them solve do that too
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:19.460]   She by the way, she hates the name oath. She told tim arne strong the company should be called rise
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.500]   Riz as both a optimistic brand and a play on the word rizin for rizin
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:31.060]   But I think the new name was already locked in katie says I think they paid a lot of money to come up with oath
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.980]   whatever
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.980]   whatever
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.540]   Let's take a break
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.460]   Go for it. I I now know what you look like you look like
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.100]   Stacey like you're in the show the leftovers. Did you ever see that? Yes, that's it. That's it. Yes
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.060]   Oh
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:52.980]   Because i'm wearing my big big shirt my big white shirt apparently your white calf tan actually you look it actually is very
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.260]   You look great. It's very flattering. It's very I mean normally you don't work you don't wear white on tv
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.580]   But you you look like an angel. I'll be honest with you
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:06.180]   There's a glow
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:11.940]   And I look like the devil it is i'm wearing my i'm wearing my uh, my
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.140]   Bush jacket
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.740]   I like it. Well if I yeah
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:24.740]   It's like you're headed to buy some guns. Yeah, I know I almost wear my pith helmet to work today
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:29.060]   Are you jeff Jarvis is also here from the city university in New York
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:33.620]   Uh, it's always a pleasure you guys. This is really to me
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.340]   It's great to have kevin toffalani was wonderful last week
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:41.060]   And the others who we took two people to fill in for stacey last week, but really it's dead
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:47.140]   This is the this is my favorite configuration of oh and see I didn't realize this until just now
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.020]   Jeff is the dark half and i'm the light i know look at this
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.900]   I'm glad I wore green
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.660]   In neutral i'm a neutral if I tried to wear that my face would just disappear
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.340]   Well, yeah
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.860]   Camera would be so confused it would know what to do. Maybe that would work. Maybe I should do that
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.660]   Maybe the camera would know what's wrong. Jeff it helps
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.780]   That's nothing will help me. Jeff a little rouge
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.140]   Maybe some lip gloss. I'd be pinker
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.980]   Oh, I forgot. I got my uh, led eyelashes. I forgot to bring him in
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.700]   No, oh leo
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.180]   Oh, says somebody right now
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.980]   Oh, no leo
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.540]   This is a kickstarter. I bought a year ago
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.380]   A thousand competitors beat them to the market
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.100]   By months for a lot less money. They finally came
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.260]   And uh, because I think you were the one who told him told me about him right stacey something
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.700]   I think so. Well, I didn't tell you to buy them. I just was like, hey these exist. They're awesome

[00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:05.300]   I love the register dot co dot uk. They really uh, they're really kind of knocking it out of the park the latest
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.020]   story from the register
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.260]   US watchdog
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.540]   Just gave up trying to get google to explain youtube's
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.740]   Huge financial figures
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.620]   Don't you worry your pretty little heads about it says web giant
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.220]   Kieran mccarthy who's great right in san francisco
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:33.540]   In a series of alternately baffling amusing and darn right ridiculous letters google parent alphabet has told america's financial watchdog
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.540]   This security is an exchange commission
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.540]   to mind its own business
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.940]   when it comes to income
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.100]   on monday
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:50.260]   The sec published six months worth of correspondence between its staff and the online giant in which the regulator repeatedly asked google to explain
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:55.460]   Why don't you break your revenue out into you know seg you know business segments
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:59:00.340]   The nerds at the chocolate factory told the answer's great
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:06.020]   Told the any fraud officials. It was probably too complicated for their little heads to figure out
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:10.900]   How you say google but they're not the only ones microsoft apple none of these companies
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.660]   Break out their financials and i apparently they're not required to although
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.220]   No, maybe the sec disagrees
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:23.700]   Yeah, the sec does i mean amazon had to finally start reporting its cloud revenue once it became material
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.180]   It's based on a new rule
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:32.100]   Well new as of last summer that says investors in a public company. This is by the way the whole rationale for this
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:36.340]   Should see the same top level financial information the ceo sees
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:41.380]   If you're investing at a company you have a right to see the company's financials and you don't
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:47.780]   It's not right for you to hide stuff from people who are putting their money into your business
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:53.860]   Which leads to the next story about what do larry and serige and sundar
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.660]   and company each do differently
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.300]   and
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.300]   So this was interesting too
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.500]   um
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.860]   Larry sets sundars pay but nobody below sundar
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.380]   For example, so
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.340]   And sundar sets everybody else's pay
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.900]   Who sets larry's pay?
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:21.700]   The board the board the board yeah, yeah, who sets the boards pay
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.980]   uh, they're competent
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:30.420]   They are person who's in charge of the compensation committee and who sets her pay
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.940]   It doesn't one of them just take a dollar though
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.060]   Her pay is set by the ceo
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.580]   Right
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:44.420]   That's actually a problem in america in general which is the boards do whatever the ceo wants because there's a scratch
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:49.220]   You scratch my back i'll scratch yours. Uh-huh thing and this is why we have ceo compensation
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.100]   Well, take a look at evan spiegel
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:58.580]   The creators ceo compensation inflation yeah, so snap is snap profitable
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.460]   No
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:06.740]   No snap. Well, here's the good news snap lost a hundred million dollars less this year than they did last year
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.460]   They only last year they lost 200 million they only lost 110 million this year
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.300]   But ceo haven't spiegel pay got paid how much would you guess
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.140]   638 million dollars
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.540]   That's the biggest ceo pay award since
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:29.060]   Tim cook took over for steve jobs and got a big jumbo piece of the pie
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:37.140]   Well, and the problem is the board which does i'm pretty sure in most cases determine ceo
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.780]   Composition
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.860]   They have no interest in uh, you know, they're i don't know. Maybe they should
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:49.620]   The salary was 77 of snaps revenue for the year
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:57.380]   Oh, yeah, I would not what's weird is people are still investing in this which is crazy to me because like
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.060]   Why would you invest in that yeah?
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.620]   Yeah, well snaps really struggling aren't they? I mean they're stock well no step that we just we did the story
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.620]   Well, if you watch week stop had a good quarter
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.660]   Yeah, they didn't lose as much money. They had a good quarter
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.300]   They only lost 110 million dollars. That's a good quarter. I guess I don't know
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:26.820]   Wait, didn't they have issues with um kylie jennor did they happen this week?
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.820]   So when jennor tweeted
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.740]   Yeah, did we do this last week? No, I don't think we did this
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.780]   We did part of the last week. Did we we did the controversy about snap last week? We didn't know kylie jennor
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.540]   So february 22nd so that was the day after we did twig last week kylie jennor tweets
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:49.140]   So does anyone else not open snapchat anymore or is it just me?
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.780]   Ugg this is so sad
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:59.540]   Snapchat as a result loses 1.3 billion dollars in stock market value
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:06.260]   This is a sick society and economy we're in actually let's be really fair and honest. It also the same day
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.220]   us the an analyst downgraded them from yes to sell
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.860]   And the market is in general kind of looking and and it has to do a little bit too
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.340]   I imagine with evan speckles amazing compensation
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.300]   Yeah, and concern mostly that facebook and instagram are starting to eat them alive
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.140]   It's also because uh, there's been a revolt
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.740]   1.3 million people signed this nap. This is what we talked about last week
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.460]   The snapchat the position to say that changed.org to say please change back to the old ui
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.380]   So it all adds up to a big stock loss, but but kylie jennor didn't help. Let's put it that way
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.500]   And she sells headlines and you can put her face on your story and it's it's easy to find and
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.140]   I'm leo will repeat it because he's looking for any reason to do a kylie jennor voice
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.100]   Okay, that is not a kylie jennor. I don't know how she sounds. That's the beauty of it
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.780]   Is his hat that's just a jerk guy doing a teenage girl voice. I mean, that's kind of what that voice was
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.060]   Jirk. Is it jirk?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.220]   She just call you a jerk
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.740]   You call you a jerk
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:13.860]   Jirk guy way of talking about a teenage girl. She called you a jerk first of all. I don't believe kylie's a teenager anymore
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.340]   Well, that's her point
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:21.300]   Um, let me let's just I'm sorry now. I have to listen to some kylie jennor video
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:26.420]   Um
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:31.780]   It's I'm sick of people being mean to teenage girls. They have it real tough
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.180]   But jennors could you be 20 now? Okay, okay
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.580]   And she has a kid. I mean
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:47.060]   Oh, well, I can't find a kylie jennor audio. I can't she's on a tv show
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:52.820]   The internet it's broken. Yeah, she's everywhere
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.940]   She it's all on snapchat and she pulled it it disappeared after 24 hours
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   I don't even honestly. I don't even know who she is. Is that her new gender? She's on youtube. Wait a second
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.100]   Yes, she's she's one of the kardashian people. She's related to
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.140]   Yeah, kylie kardashian gender
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:19.780]   No, no, um kylie and her sister and you're yelling at me for doing a valley girl voice
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:29.460]   Yes, I am. I'm I just I think when I do valley boys. I talk like this man. I mean, I make fun of them both equally
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.420]   I
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.700]   Do you find her? Uh-oh. I think so. We'll see if she talks
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.180]   No, she's this is that's the problem. Kiley never speaks
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.740]   No
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.740]   Is that a scream?
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.820]   So I apologize for a few more daughter
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   Here she is. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here's highly gender exclusive interview
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.020]   You got it? Okay
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:07.860]   Can I play it let me play it from here. This is this the new our daughter video. Yeah, all right. I don't know if she speaks there or not
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.020]   Yeah, we're going and we're waiting for you kiley
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.220]   Right there. She's pointing
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:18.420]   It's gonna be okay. Oh, she's cute
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.060]   Apparently she's having a baby
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:26.180]   Uh, yeah
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:31.140]   You can wait before you oh my god christie. Oh, she sounds oh no that wasn't her
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:39.780]   That's her all right. She sounds normal. I apologize kiley
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.060]   You sound normal
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.260]   Oh that kind of dad kind of sounded
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:54.180]   Is that her? I don't know maybe that's somebody else. That's a friend. You're right
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:59.220]   Living our lives having fun. She met your father. Oh, yeah, that's her friend
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:03.620]   You don't think what I did sounds a little bit like that
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.820]   That's not
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:12.500]   Okay, her friend. I was doing her friend reading kiley's tweet
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:20.260]   Okay, fine fine fine. I just somebody said the show is being cardassassinated
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   Uh
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:31.140]   Otherwise speaking of the scc which we worked evidence ago. They've launched a cryptocurrency probe
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:35.540]   That sounds painful. Yep, uh on whom
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:41.700]   Uh, they they subpoenaed a pukeling. Can they unlock my bitcoin wallet because that would be
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.180]   That's a probe worth taking
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:52.180]   Google beta tests flutter toolkit for better cross platform apps
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.660]   We're talking about this on windows weekly. I didn't understand it then either
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:00.900]   Uh, the idea is I guess that uh
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:07.220]   You you you you have you build an app for both ios and android with one
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.500]   Open source toolkit at their native apps
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.940]   Oh, and here's a little bonus for google. They also work with google's new os fuchsia
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:21.060]   This was announced at mobile world congress flutter is officially in beta. Let's
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:27.860]   Let's watch the video mobile users expect their apps to have beautiful designs smooth animations and great performance
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:34.740]   To deliver on this developers need to create new features faster than ever without compromising on quality or performance
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.540]   That's why we built flutter
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:43.540]   Flutter is google's mobile ui framework that provides a fast and expressive way how would tom broca say flutter
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.260]   Flutter
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.460]   developers to build native apps on both ios and android
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.300]   This is because apps and interfaces made with flutter are built
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:09:01.220]   Compiled directly to native arm code use the gpu and can access platform apis. This is not informative
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.900]   This is just does not some silly video. I'd rather watch the
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.300]   Waymo video. Oh
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   Is there a way
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:19.860]   Yes, it's very cool. It's also trying to be work. This is this is you will like the future in our hands. It will be okay
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:26.740]   You will be fine. It's a 360 experience. So while we're doing this I will
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.500]   Back in 2009. They are early days ago
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.340]   Whoop, I clicked on a little we started working on self-driving cars
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:41.140]   Today we're called waymo and our fully self-driving cars are on the road
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:48.740]   They use a range of technology. We've built from the ground up. Understand the world around them and get you where you need to go
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.340]   Sees things
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:54.740]   You're about to see how it all works. Okay, and what it feels like. There's the way mobile
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:06.660]   As it drives waymo uses lidar which sends out millions of laser beams per second to build up a detailed picture of the world all
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.980]   360 degrees around it
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.540]   That's me
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:14.260]   It also uses radar to detect how far away objects are and their speed
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:20.820]   And high resolution cameras detect visual information like whether a traffic signal is red or green
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:26.340]   It then combines all that data to understand the world around it
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:31.700]   For example in this fraction of a second it knows exactly where it is on the road
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:38.260]   It's going there's a cop by everything around it in full 360 degrees
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:44.740]   And then predict what those things might do next. That's the thing that's interesting, right?
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.980]   What would those things do next and it doesn't just do that for the objects you and I can see
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.860]   This is cool. Do that for things up to three football fields away
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.860]   How does it do that? Well, what makes lidar is how original possible is experience
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.980]   Waymo has already self-driven millions of miles on complicated city streets
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.460]   And it's constantly learning from every single mile it drives. There's a way mobile
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:15.300]   With all that knowledge it can plan a safe path ahead
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.340]   In this instance giving that cyclist enough room to cycle past us
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.380]   And also looking out for that pedestrian on the sidewalk
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.580]   That's better than I can do
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.900]   I'd hit one of the other. I'm going to close to making decisions. Oh, look
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.420]   This is a good example of how waymo just take into account your safety
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:40.020]   It also makes sure that both you and the people around you feel secure and at ease
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:44.500]   That by the way, that's really important. That's a psychological thing not a
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.540]   tactical driving thing
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.660]   But it it airs in the side of of reassuring you, right?
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:55.780]   So now that you know how waymo works, it's time to take your first ride in one of our cars
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.020]   Oh
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.260]   So we're this is again 360. I don't want to do two more the back seats of a car
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.860]   Yeah, because I don't want to make you queasy some things might immediately stand out
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.700]   The fact that there's no one in the driver's seat. Yeah, yeah, that stands out
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:14.260]   Yeah, the screens. Well, why am I sitting in the back seat if there's no driver and the route it's taking
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.780]   Shouldn't there just be one seat?
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.620]   So notice that the ride feels a lot like being driven in a regular car
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.140]   I like it that we have displays about what's going on, you know, yeah, what the
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.660]   Yeah
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:30.340]   It's the way it should Tesla as you know stacey because you have one does that which is that's very helpful when your autopilot's engaged
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.620]   You can kind of yeah when you're like, does this do this? I don't know if it sees us
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:42.900]   Yeah, feel all this technology which allows waymo to see identify predict and plan should make an extraordinary ride feel completely ordinary
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.900]   And create a very normal journey that simply gets you from a to b
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.460]   Safe and sound it's interesting that they still have cars with front seats and back seats
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.820]   Is sit back relax and enjoy well they just got cleared to test without a driver
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:02.020]   Wow, California really yeah, would you get in one of those?
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:09.060]   Yeah, I'm crazy. I you know, you you wouldn't you you buy a
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.340]   Eyelashes, it's no worse than
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.300]   Teaching your teenager to drive
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.860]   Yeah, right it's probably much less worse
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:23.940]   That's really a nightmare and in fact, I was thinking about it the other day the only way I got through it
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:26.900]   Is by just assuming that I was gonna die
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.060]   it's like
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.260]   like well
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.980]   Probably i'm gonna die now, but you know, I've had a good life
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.540]   And i'm just gonna you know
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.460]   go with it
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:41.780]   My family just took me to the driver's ed place so they they would have all the pain
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.620]   Yeah, I think that's what we're gonna do with michael. He's 15. He'll be uh, drive, you know
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.980]   Getting his learner's in a few months. Does he want to i'm wondering if Anna will ever get her learner's permit
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.700]   She's 11, you know, my son my other my biological son. So michael's my stepson
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.060]   uh
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.060]   Henry who's now 23
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:05.060]   Did not he deferred it till he was 18 in california you can get a permit when you're 15 and half and drive when you're 16
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.460]   He didn't get it to his 18
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:14.420]   My daughter my daughter like the the minute she could go in the dmv to get the permit
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.140]   She did the day like like she was waiting at the door
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:24.340]   Uh, so it's just different people, but uh, no michael wants to learn because his father's a car buff
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:32.420]   And so and so he's like he's he's already decided which car he's gonna take to the driver's test. Oh, which car he's gonna learn in
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.740]   Which you know, it's he's got the whole plan in his head already
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.780]   So i'm not looking forward to that, but i don't think i'll have to sit next to him
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:42.420]   I do remember sitting next to abbey and literally thinking
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:46.900]   You know, just kind of being i guess kind of uh fatalistic about it like well
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.140]   What are you gonna do?
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.140]   Otherwise you're screaming the whole time
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.380]   That's not that's unseemly and makes it more likely that she's gonna run into something right?
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.020]   I like that
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:08.260]   Pressing your imaginary brake or you've reached for the wheel, which is very dangerous, right? Yes
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.700]   Should not do that dad alpha. I'm gonna hope I don't have to deal with this
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.660]   Yeah, it's not fun, but it's you know, it's part of parenthood
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.100]   Having a teenager is not fun enough for many many many reasons
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.060]   alphabets for them
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.420]   Is is also so we saw amazon
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.940]   Joining with bircher Hathaway and jp morgan to do health
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:36.900]   apple has announced it's going to do health care for its employees ac health care
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:43.940]   And now verily is plotting a move into the health insurance industry. That's google's or i should say alphabets
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:53.460]   uh life extension right verily's the life extension company or health the contact yeah contact diabetes and other stuff there uh
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:16:00.100]   in a 90 in 2016 a month mold jointly putting in a proposal with alphabet backed oscar health
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:07.060]   to manage health care for thousands of low-income road island residents in medicaid oscar should mention was a sponsor and
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.940]   Is run by jared kushner's brother?
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:13.700]   little side note
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:22.020]   The uh, it's a it's a it's an interesting startup the idea is to use technology to do a more uh effective health care solution
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.340]   But it's only available in a few states
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:31.220]   So they're going to work together to do what?
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:38.740]   They're going to reduce the cost and take part of that benefit and what's interesting to me the way the story put it was that it's all about
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.780]   That they're all interested in going into areas of risk
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.660]   Is it anything that can reduce risk?
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:50.100]   In other words serve people who really need it most the riskiest
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.980]   part of the population
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:56.180]   Is that it or they're trying to reduce the overall risk and thus
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:00.740]   I mean here's the the low low-income road island residents. These are high risk
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:06.980]   In short and they're hard to get us for if they can reduce the risk for them. They can do for anyone. I think it's kind of okay
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:11.940]   Uh taking health risk is a different order of magnitude
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.980]   Of complexity than what we see in the other industries
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:20.260]   Right to make a dent in health spending experts say companies need to have the right blend of talent resources or risk losing money
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:26.500]   If it costs escalate. Yeah, I mean it's look if you're a low risk, it's easy to get health insurance and it's
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:31.300]   Right right puppy
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:35.540]   And it's less expensive, but that's not a new new needs health insurance
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:44.100]   And that's that's the whole idea of you know this whole idea of having a forced insurance and all that is to get a larger pool of both health
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.340]   Uh, let's see gurg google
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:55.700]   Uh, is this my typo or you're you're as karstin. It's an article about google word coach, but it's written as me
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:59.620]   Couch I guess I need it google word couch
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:03.940]   I'm sorry a fun game in this search results. I haven't seen this
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.660]   Well, because I think we speak english. Oh
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.380]   This is to learn english. Oh neat
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.340]   So when you do a search that triggers a dictionary or translate box google may show you
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.460]   This word coach it helps you expand english language vocabulary in a fun and engaging way
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.740]   So that's cool
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:28.020]   Which word is similar to strength? Oh, I want this for spanish. Yeah, yeah, I do too
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:35.220]   Is google or you listening google? It currently is only available in non english speaking countries and in india
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:39.460]   Which is an english speaking country, but it's where it's available
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:49.300]   So another google story if I may yes, please a rare win for google in germanese courts
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:53.300]   germanese highest court rules the google is not obligated to ensure
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:58.180]   websites are free from defamatory content before displaying links so somebody who had a
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:02.420]   A right to be forgotten claim said not only do we want you to take that down
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:05.300]   We want you to never let anything bad like that come up again, right?
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.260]   And the courts said uh, no
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.260]   Interesting job and the court also stood up for search engines and the value of them
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:18.580]   Because here in the united states the house of representatives yesterday voted the exact opposite
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:22.100]   This is oh no, yeah fosta the
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:26.260]   fight online sex trafficking act
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:33.140]   allows for private lawsuits and criminal prosecutions against internet platforms and websites based on
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:40.260]   The actions of their users it overturned section 230 of the communications decency act which is our
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.780]   um for safe harbors. Yeah, it's safe harbors
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:50.900]   The bill passed get this 388 to 25 it overturns all of 230. Yeah
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.220]   Oh no
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:59.860]   Oh, no, that's deadly to to to to conversation online. That means basically that any site is going to play safe
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.660]   by the irachian
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.980]   And the responsible so they're not going to allow any interaction so
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:09.060]   That yeah, because if if I had a comment section on twit
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:16.340]   And somebody put something libelous or nasty or defamatory or whatever on there. I could get sued
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:20.900]   Even why is there not more of an I did not see this. Why is there not more of an up?
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.700]   Why are we not in it?
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.620]   It happened today
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:29.220]   Yeah, but we've been warned about this. We've been talking about it for a week. I know
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.940]   See any coverage
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.500]   No, the senate coverage the senate has to vote
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:40.740]   But now is the time absolutely to write or call your member of congress particular senator
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:48.900]   And say please you have to vote against fosta. Do not be fooled into thinking this somehow has anything to do with sex trafficking. It doesn't
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:54.340]   Yeah, I saw it on jesbell. I think yesterday ours had a story today
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:59.060]   Yeah, but i'm talking about the new york times in the washington post and cnn the place where it makes a difference
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.820]   And look at the fact that this is what's really important
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.220]   Because there hasn't been a public hue and cry on this the house
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:12.340]   Which should know better passed at 388 to 25. Oh god
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:19.300]   So that just shows that there isn't a general understanding in congress about why this is a bad idea
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:27.220]   And this is why I have a fit about the moral panic because now anything you do against technology is going to go swimming through the political realm
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.380]   Because technology is bad for us
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:35.860]   EFF rights the tragedy is that fosta isn't needed to protect or sue sex traffickers
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:40.260]   As we've said before section 230 simply isn't broken right now
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:49.140]   There's nothing preventing federal prosecution of an internet company that knowingly aids in sex trafficking that includes anyone hosting advertisements for sex trafficking
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.540]   That's explicitly a federal crime
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:58.020]   The website that produced the most discussion around this issue back page.com is reportedly under federal investigation
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.460]   The array of online services protected
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.740]   By section 230 and thus hurt by fosta is vast review sites
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:12.580]   online marketplaces discussion boards internet service providers any news
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:17.700]   News publications with comment sections this affects us all in media. Yep
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:24.500]   Well, uh, if this passes with comments. Yes if this passes comments are gone
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.700]   I'm not going to have comments on my blog. That's for sure
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.460]   Uh, it puts reddit out of business
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:36.260]   I would guess literally out of business and anything like reddit
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.620]   If this is disastrous. Yeah
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:44.260]   And you're right jeff where's the mainstream coverage of this?
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.020]   That's my problem. It was tasty. You're right is in the tech world, but but but unless it gets
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:53.460]   Unless this passes over into the pippa soap on pippa creepa, whatever the hell those were
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:57.460]   This is like sesta, which we did we're able to bring down. That's terrible
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:03.460]   But I think team vogue had something team vogue right on team. Hey, hey
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:09.300]   Oh, it's too depressing we did stop sesta
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.100]   But now there's fosta
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.900]   Call honestly the best thing you can do at this point is call your senator
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:20.740]   Uh, if it passed by that vast a marty margin across par all party lines in the house
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.820]   It's almost certain to pass the senate, right?
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.420]   Uh
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:29.220]   Yeah, I would guess fortunately the president will never sign this in a law
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:33.940]   Uh, that's that's a joke. That's that's facetious. He will
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.500]   Uh logan paul's back didn't last long
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:40.500]   Oh, but he's on 90 day probation super secret double probation
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:47.700]   Nothing more than still not eligible for you to his preferred ad pro
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.060]   Preferred that you know, he hoped that we're just gonna make sure he's good for a while
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:24:00.340]   So this ties into the little things story as far as i'm concerned the death of little things
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:06.180]   Which is no things is not the least bit offensive, but it is a child. It was a child. It is now a
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:13.700]   dead child of the business model of going after volume and going after attention that leads to all this
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:20.180]   Little things was a really fluffy little publisher that did little restaurant things or other recipe things and other stuff
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:25.140]   And it built on top of facebook and so facebook changes the algorithm to get rid of
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.580]   Dumb shareable stuff and there goes little things and they're closing
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:30.820]   And some people on
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:35.940]   On twitter said when I noted this they said well, you should you know, you should be this is people lost their jobs
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.580]   Which I feel bad for other people said well live by the platform died by the platform
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.180]   Okay, but my argument here is that what what what it's bigger than that
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:54.020]   Business model behind facebook said let's let's reward shareable content so companies were created and detours
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.620]   Media companies were made to let's make lots of shareable content
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:02.580]   And then that makes for a really rotten experience and then facebook finally says oh that was crappy
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:07.460]   Let's get rid of all that shareable yunky content and then boom down go those companies
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:15.060]   Um, what's wrong here is the business model behind all of this that goes for volume for volume sake and that and that
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.820]   um
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:22.580]   That rewards track so the real question is what's quality? How do we get to quality? How do we reward that?
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:28.820]   How do we re-figure that out if you look at this the site is it's it's almost it's not demand media, but it really is clearly
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.980]   It's very close. It's very close
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:37.780]   Yeah to generate traffic because their subject matter is food paraining pets and diy
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:42.580]   I mind you I was a tv critic. I'm not exactly sitting on a high horse here. I started in him a weekly
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.660]   I'm not as I was sitting on high horse. I'm okay with fluff. I get it. I get lifestyle. I get service
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.340]   But this is just
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.500]   And look at how they do this. I mean here's the article
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.380]   I put a wacky doggy leotard on my dog to see if it would help with their anxiety and dander
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:58.980]   And of course a big button share on facebook, right?
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:04.020]   And uh, that's what this is all about. It actually this is actually an ad. I take it back
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.500]   This is this is thinly veiled as editorial. It's actually it is. Oh
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:14.900]   So let's uh, by the way, it doesn't say ad when I click the link. Oh, yeah, how about this 18 month old
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:20.180]   Is that an advertisement? Maybe they're not ads then maybe this just what does this mean?
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.140]   I don't think so. I don't know. Oh, maybe I'm miss. Oh, maybe that's maybe there's my ad blockers blocking the ad
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.140]   That's why
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.460]   Let's turn off the ad blocker. There we go
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.700]   Now we can see the ad
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.700]   There is the ad
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:38.180]   And by the way, the ad does feature a number of fine dog sweaters and
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.820]   leotards
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   All right, um
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.780]   Yeah, I mean, I I can't warn this but this is
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:52.980]   A whole category of content that I mean, you know, mashables struggling. Mashable just got sold. There's a lot of
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.620]   A lot of sites that are going to disappear
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.420]   Even vox later off last week. Yeah, but the fox laid what 50 people off
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:06.180]   I thought fox if anybody vox did they say why they laid those people off
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:10.820]   Even though I think they also said they were going to be strong and fun. I think they will be they just um
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:17.300]   Some of the things that were getting rewarded aren't rewarded now. So this is just what's happening across the board
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:20.580]   Uh, five the elantics hiring more good
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.140]   Good
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.180]   Racked curbed sb nation
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:31.060]   Those are the three uh vox properties that are going to be hardest hit by the layoffs
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:36.580]   So yeah, those are those are probably sites that generate that got a lot of traffic from
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:40.020]   Uh
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.100]   Facebook
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.460]   Buzzfeed mashable refinery 29 each of made layoffs
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:50.020]   Vox, uh, you know has some big partners
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.420]   I'm sure they're fine. I mean they'll be around for a long time, but
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.140]   Okay
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.780]   So it's uh, you know just one more but yet as you said live by
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:08.580]   The sword die by the sword live by the facebook, uh die by the facebook. Oh, you like the doggy leotard story too. Did you
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:13.060]   What yeah, that's why that's why i went to
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.740]   Great minds
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.540]   When when it comes to drivel jeff and i are in complete agreement
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:25.860]   Hey, my dog has anxiety and if I thought eliotard would help I would totally click on that story. Oh, it does by the way
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:32.340]   Like the thunder shirt. Yeah, the thunder shirt. Okay. Do you have a thunder shirt? I do. Yeah, so do I for me
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:36.660]   Self-help, I'll tell you have you as anybody
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.780]   bought one of those extra heavy blankets
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:46.900]   Oh, the weighted blankets. Oh, I met someone who just bought one. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it was an executive in
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:54.340]   Some iot company. So this is this is by the way why instagram and facebook ads work because we all know about heavy blankets
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.460]   from that right
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.140]   Yeah
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.620]   And the way there is a futuristic it is
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.620]   It's futurist made their own they had their own branded blanket
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.420]   Really and they sold five million dollars worth
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.940]   How heavy does a weighted blanket have to be 25 pounds? I think let's check the chart
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.580]   futurism
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.220]   For kids
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:23.220]   Plus one or two pounds for adult 10 of ideal body weight
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.940]   Not actual body weight
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:30.420]   Yeah, by the way wait wait a minute
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.460]   There's some of the charts missing is missing a couple
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:38.820]   what
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:45.460]   So I should uh, yeah, see 25 pounds is too heavy. I should probably be I should have like a 15 pound blanket
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.340]   Who knew
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:53.060]   The things like on this show
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.740]   Anything else here, what else?
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.900]   Twitter do we want to talk about net neutrality
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:07.300]   Yeah, so it's official as of friday. Uh, there is no net neutrality 18 t didn't waste any time immediately started launching fast lanes
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.620]   for its own content
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.700]   Ta da
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.540]   for direct tv
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.540]   Uverse
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.700]   Now
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.380]   To be clear
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:24.820]   For the longest time and it's been a while since I have dug into 18 t's network
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:30.020]   But for a while they had their uverse and their own content under
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:35.540]   It was a managed service. So it was already going it was already prioritized
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.180]   Yeah, this is this is basically zero rating. They're saying right. This is zero rating
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.100]   You won't pay against
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:46.260]   A data fees against any of our services, but it's exactly the same issue
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:50.900]   I know it's harder to explain to consumers why not paying for something is bad
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:56.980]   But it is bad because it means it advantages their services over competitors services like
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:03.940]   That do you like youtube or twit that do use ban? It's like subsidizing corn wait a second
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:07.460]   Do that and pretty soon all our cars will be running on ethanol
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:14.180]   I was thinking more obesity epidemic and sugary sodas being so she but yes that too
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:17.140]   Now what are you with that they make that?
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:20.980]   I find a little bit sympathetic. So are you the is is well
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:26.740]   But if you're if you're running a medical application in an operating room or you're you're working on a self-driving car
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:32.500]   Shouldn't that have priority? So let's talk about that because this is actually something I report on
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.420]   Yes
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.780]   That was your cue
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:40.820]   That was you you're so good to be jeff. Thank you. Um, this is
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:46.340]   No, I think you're a jerk. I'm a jerk
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:50.100]   But jeff you're so good. I am
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.980]   so
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:54.180]   Okay
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:55.860]   backing up net neutrality so
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:04.820]   Companies already have an option. They can actually used cellular spectrum or licensed spectrum for these
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.580]   particular use cases and they can pay to do that they don't have to use
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.700]   the public internet or my
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:20.740]   Basic home connection and that's how today a lot of these things are run your metal medical equipment
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:28.100]   Is cellular in most cases? It's not usually Wi-Fi yet because people don't want to make it hackable and all these other things
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.940]   So there are avenues for dedicated connections
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.420]   For connected devices like cars and whatever very expensive though, right?
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:41.860]   They are expensive and who owns those connections? Well, it's at and t and
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:45.780]   We can make some arguments about the economics
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.180]   Associated with
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:54.500]   The amount of data that these guys carry and that's it's frankly not a competitive space. So
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:00.580]   Yes, it's expensive, but you're paying for that
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.580]   That
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.900]   That dedication that guarantee of quality
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:13.460]   And then there's also enterprise connections with quality of service guarantees and you can pay that as a business if you want
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:19.140]   What's likely to happen is for cars you're going to have a dedicated car connection
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:25.700]   You're not going to rely on just generic internet for prescribed medical devices
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.940]   I think that's one area where it gets really interesting
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.020]   And I don't actually know where that's going to happen or like how that's going to play out
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.140]   I don't like the idea of
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:43.460]   Giving that paid priority because they don't actually think it's necessary. I think there are technological and business things that could happen first
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:49.300]   That may not happen because we don't live in a competitive market. However, so that's that
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:52.420]   Thank you
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   Oh leo lift
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.340]   It must be because we called him a jerk
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:01.700]   We took over we took over that's finally the revolution has come we are
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:07.540]   And and i'm curious because like the states are now doing um
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:11.060]   Oh, it's like oh shit. Show. She comes the jerk
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:16.580]   I thought you two should have a little moment together
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:20.500]   You know what would have been awesome is if you kind of just burst out of the
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.380]   You just like
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.020]   Now they have to reset all the cameras because I moved your avatars around i'm sorry
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.780]   Oh
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.820]   Engineers now have to fix what leo broke
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:39.860]   Uh
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:44.260]   We should mention that now that net neutrality is officially dead
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:46.820]   Uh, the lawsuits can begin
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:53.700]   It will remain dead until such time as a judge says no, we need it and there is also a
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.660]   A billing in uh congress, I think
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.340]   To restore it and of course, yes many districts
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:06.900]   And states washing in dc. I mentioned districts washing dc has created a very strong net neutrality
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.700]   Uh law for itself
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.500]   So we'll see Texas will never get one
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.780]   Yeah, the eyes of texas are well of at a t at not gonna happen. Yeah
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:22.020]   So
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.260]   Uh, I don't know. Do you want to do you want to kill this show?
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.940]   Are we done or do we want to do is there anything else to talk about or we could do
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.980]   We we talked about right to be forgotten
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:37.140]   We talked about that quite a lot and I don't know if jeff you saw that google's researchers
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:43.300]   Looked at the requests that had been made for them. Yeah, I don't know. This is more like a jeff thing
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.940]   I'm not like super hit it. Please
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.740]   Well other than
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.300]   What I thought was most interesting is most of the
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:53.860]   requests were coming from
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.420]   a few people and the requests
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:01.300]   In certain countries were focused on news articles and and others were focused on
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:08.980]   Uh search results. So I just thought I thought the breakdown was kind of interesting, but I didn't have much to say beyond that. I'll be honest
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:15.060]   So 11 comes from government and
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:19.780]   Corporate 89 from individuals
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   Hmm
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:26.340]   What information is requested for d listing professional information a quarter
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:31.860]   self on crime 8 percent professional wrongdoing 7 percent
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:38.660]   Sensitive personal information 2 percent. That's pretty small. So it's people on their reputations
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:45.300]   Yeah, and I thought it was interesting what a large percentage google thought and successfully thought
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.340]   So much. Yes. Yeah, well, I think it was slightly more than half. Was it?
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.020]   Well, it's but I said also they fought no google's not fighting at google's just saying we choose not to do this good
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.740]   This is the irony. You tech companies are too powerful. Now. Let's give you some more power. Right
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:06.740]   Um, so that's exactly what they've done with with both right to be forgotten and the nets they gay
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:10.900]   In germany where they're getting facebook especially to take down
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:16.100]   Hate speech and stuff and they're making facebook decide. Yeah, but you don't really want to do
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.860]   I thought there was a process for the right to be forgotten
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.060]   Extra google process. No, no
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.780]   Or something. Yeah, there's kind of a review
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.780]   Committee that their standards and stuff, but no, that's that's the thing is there they put the
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:35.220]   And google and facebook hate this they you know if you tell me it's against the law and tell me I take it down
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:39.300]   That's officials. Yeah, I'll take it down, but I don't want to tell me this decider
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:45.540]   They're the judge and jury and an executioner. So yeah, google's only removed about 43 percent of the requests
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:52.580]   So I think google's trying to do it responsibly is what that tells me. Yeah, maybe while google's also a fighting a businessman in
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:55.940]   The uk who's trying to get right to be forgotten
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:59.940]   Uh referred only as nt1 for legal reasons
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.100]   um
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.660]   That articles had caused distress and upset
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.620]   But google saying
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:13.140]   No, this is this is reporting on you. Let me submit that this then is showing that this has worked
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:17.060]   Well, I think that's run a strong
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:23.380]   verdict well, but I mean I mean we thought it was going to be the end of the world, but in fact
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.180]   Uh, it seems to be working google's removed
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:32.980]   43 of them, but has not removed that means 57. Well, I don't know that the 43 percent their remove should have been removed
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:37.460]   That's the thing. I don't what is the penalty. I mean there must be some
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:41.140]   Somebody looking at what they're doing and saying no, no, not really
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.460]   Well, that's that unless you sue google, which is what's happening in the uk is the first
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.660]   It's the first such case in the uk and google's fighting back and saying no this involves
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:53.380]   um
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.380]   uh
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:00.100]   Deceptive and and misleading criminal practices. Yeah
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.460]   And so we're not taking this stuff down and the guys fighting them
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:10.660]   Well, and how much of this is because in the uk their libel laws for example are really different
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.100]   um
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.060]   And I wonder how much of this is kind of a
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:19.540]   This is what google says its criterion is
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.460]   quote
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.580]   That they they review each request on a case-by-case basis
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.860]   Determining whether content is in the public interest
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:32.020]   Is complex and may mean considering many diverse factors including
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:37.220]   But not limited to whether the content relates to the requester's professional life
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.780]   A past crime political office
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:44.180]   Position in public life whether the content is self-authored content
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:50.500]   Consists of government documents or is journalistic in nature now actually they don't say what the criteria are they just say this is what they consider
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:55.700]   What's weird? I mean they much google must do they make where make them wear wigs? They must have a whole
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.420]   Abort of basically judges
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:04.900]   Extra extra legal judges. Well in the case of the nets de yay and and germany and facebook
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.220]   They've hired thousands of people to go over stuff. They i'm told they get like 30 seconds to make a judgment
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:15.940]   And that's why I think I said last week that my joke is that satires dead in germany right as if it was over alive
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.700]   um
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.500]   But that's a joke by the way, that's the joke, but uh
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:25.140]   Yeah, if you have the slightest doubt now out it goes
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:29.300]   And you have very little time to decide something that has some nuance to it
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:34.100]   I wonder if they oh wait a minute. Yes, the european regulators did publish way back when
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:37.060]   uh the criteria
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:46.340]   The interest of the public overrides the right of the data subject de yelisting will not be appropriate
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:52.260]   So yeah, there are some criteria
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:56.580]   Again, I might I mean i'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate here
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.420]   But I might say that this has not turned out to be the disaster that we were worried about
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:08.740]   Is that there's there's other stuff coming? I I think google has handled it as well as they could that's why I'd be fair say
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:11.460]   Say given this lump of coal
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:18.020]   And you know putting out some research on it is helpful so you can see what's been done. I'm kind of
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.980]   I was actually distressed about
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:28.580]   The miners who it's a relatively small percentage of overall, but i'm like god. I hope all of their stuff was kind of expunged
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:31.220]   um unless there I guess there
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:39.620]   Well, no, even your criminal records can be but see that's the point is I think there is some public interest in having some stuff be eliminated
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:46.500]   Uh, I would be a journalist. I would disagree. Yeah. Well, what's happened this happened rewriting history is always an dangerous thing
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.220]   We're but we're at an unprecedented level
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:51.540]   unprecedented level of
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:57.860]   Being able to find the most minute insignificant details about someone and then blow those up out of proportion
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.060]   I mean, that's that's kind of part of that's a different part as a society
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.660]   No, but
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:09.220]   having if I put something stupid when I was 18 years old on a website and it's still searchable
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:12.820]   Normally that sort of that sort of action takes place
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:18.340]   In an isolation and you don't have to live with that for the rest of your life
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:22.500]   Good segue Leo actually that give karsten credit for that. He
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.300]   Is to go in quinn nor his response to being fired at the new york times
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.940]   Uh for her past
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.340]   Uh, she says uh, it was her doppelganger
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:39.700]   New york times fired my doppelganger. It's actually a great read. It's in the elvenos. Yeah, yeah
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:44.660]   And she and I have even more respect. We should try to get quinn on this show. She's great
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:47.060]   Can do you have a connection with her? I don't
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:52.100]   Uh, kevin mark sounded like he knew her. Let's see if we could figure out. I'm sure he does
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.180]   Yeah, let's figure out a way to get her on because I
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:58.100]   That's this is a great piece and it really points up some of the problems
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:04.820]   Uh, and what the new york times did was very strange given the time the time the speed with which they did it
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:08.100]   mere hours after hiring her they fired her
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.980]   Having looked at some old tweets apparently
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:14.900]   So does she have the right for those tweets to be forgotten?
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:19.780]   No, she's she's an adult. So I was specifically talking
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.460]   I agree. I agree, but I think that there are there's well
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.620]   I don't know I I what I
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:28.820]   I do think you can make a case in some cases where this is
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:31.380]   a good thing
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:34.260]   Miners is the best case something you did as a kid
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:39.620]   Which has no bearing on anything in the present but is still a smurching your record
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:43.380]   I think you know, we expunged criminal records for minors
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:47.700]   This would be what's the number this none of this takes down the content. Well, that's the thing
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:55.700]   Your source you can't link it's the wrong source. Obviously you're punishing the search engine instead of the source of the content. So that's clearly
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:59.220]   Broken. I don't know. I understand why they did that
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:02.420]   But on balance, maybe this is a good compromise
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:05.300]   speaking of minors
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.980]   Uh john olivers lawsuit, uh, has victor. Yes. Yes. You remember the uh, the
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:16.900]   Murray energies ceo robert murray sued the host of last week tonight after
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:20.420]   HBO ran a segment criticizing him in the coal industry
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:28.420]   A judge quite rightly I think through that out. Um, murray energy says will appeal it to the west virginia supreme court
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:37.860]   The judge wrote he thought lawyers for hb on oliver put forth well founded and appropriate arguments dismissed the case
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.500]   Uh, this thing about like the first amendment something like that
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:44.420]   Yeah, I guess the first amendment doesn't protect against defamation
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.780]   Right
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:51.300]   Uh, let it do do do all right. I'm gonna call it
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.100]   You're gonna call it
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.100]   To the show that's it
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:59.460]   Anything else and other
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:04.740]   No, I think you got it. I think you see that's the thing leo
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.300]   I think sometimes you leave stuff out and look through and nobody got you
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.820]   This show
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.980]   Either my watch has stopped or this show is dead
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:19.060]   So I I feel like I'm sorry. I'm not very energetic and none of the news. It's a you know, where are we?
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:23.860]   We can only cover what happens what happens. We got it. We cannot make it up
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.060]   Got it. We cannot make it up
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:32.660]   Stacy do you have an item a thing you would like to talk about or should I go to jeff first?
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:37.540]   I I don't have a thing. I am in search of a thing and I am
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.420]   dismayed because I cannot find it
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:47.300]   So there's a thing person you're there. You're there. You're the zarina of things. I know and you're the internet of
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.180]   Things there are no new things
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:59.060]   Not only is he so shut down but the internet and the entire world of iot has just shut down because stacy has run out of things
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:06.580]   He has no things. There are no more things people. This is a crisis of things. We are a thingless
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.740]   This show has been kardash. I shashinated
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.860]   kardash. I shashinated
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.180]   No, no, okay
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:17.060]   Jeff your number of the week
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:21.380]   I got three or four. Good. I think I'm gonna stay so good. You'll make up for my lack excellent
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:29.300]   Yeah, so so I got one that's all I'll do is a number so so zuckerberg and company just settled for 35 million dollars a suit over their ipo
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.540]   in which
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:34.740]   Facebook was not open enough about the risk they had
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:40.420]   Of growth which amuses the hell out of me of course because if you held on to your stock back then folks
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:43.140]   uh
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:45.620]   It was fine. It was just fine
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:52.260]   That's my number. Yeah, I mean actually if you if you bought facebook stock on day one
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:54.900]   You've you've made a lot of money
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.700]   Right, but then I wanted to I was I was amused. I found someone worse than
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:03.940]   The worst nightmare of the closet at twit
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:12.820]   Hange edwards is moving this I want and sell it trying to get rid of his collection of computers since 1993
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:17.940]   He kept everything this I've been through all these computers, but I didn't keep any of them
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.500]   He kept the stuff you go down in that that's right. They're born and there's inventory
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.940]   Uh there it is. That's a Commodore
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:30.900]   Yeah, I mean I recognize all of these and we've had many of them in the basement of the uh
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:34.740]   Brick house this kind of looks like the basement did after a while
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:40.420]   Yeah, people the part of that was because people like benj brought their old stuff. He's moving. I guess
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:47.220]   Uh, look at that think wait a minute. Let's go back to that think pad cabinet. That's wild
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.100]   There's something about people think pads. They just they just can't get rid of them
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.700]   That's amazing that somebody else. That's another one. Yeah, that's uh
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:59.380]   Tashua vuin chi in chi tashua in chi
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.420]   Wow think pad cabinet. I wish I had a think pad cabinet
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:08.180]   That's like my nightmare
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:14.980]   Well, my wife's got all this stuff. We've I've been getting rid of everything. I was going to make viro my pick of the week, but now I guess not
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:19.540]   Now I guess I don't I won't
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.420]   You convinced me i'm gonna but I like it
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:27.460]   Well, you can still use it. No, I feel guilty now. It's I'm supporting
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:33.860]   Well, are we sure not? I can't compare with this game. It looks like it looks like he's
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:41.780]   Perhaps not the most he's definitely it looks like he's lying about that because they they brought up press releases where he was still currently
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:46.660]   Listed is employed there in 2016 or some anonymous wikipedia poster
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:50.740]   Well, the anonymous wikipedia poster was trying to help them out right
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:53.780]   So I don't know if he said anything at all
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.900]   Uh
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:58.660]   They still report
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:01.060]   replied to my comment on facebook
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:04.660]   Yes, oh
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:09.300]   Wink starting off with a small test, but I plan to entice them to more shows
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.020]   That says we're not in
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:14.020]   Hmm
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:18.580]   I think next next week. I'm gonna have my wine glass here just to entice them in
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:22.180]   I ordered wine. I I was like hey
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:27.140]   The wink story is really interesting. I I can't wait to do these ads because it's actually
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:31.140]   Uh, I'm really excited about it. It's more than at first
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:36.100]   I thought oh, this is a you know because they're clubs where they sell extra wine like winemakers made too much
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.500]   And then they kind of they don't you know like that's what fab and guilt were right?
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.540]   Someone would kind of have fake labels, right? Yeah, why?
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:46.500]   Wink isn't that way at all. It's really interesting
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:49.540]   They even make a lot of their own wine there's some very interesting stuff
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:55.380]   And I had a glass of some of the best one I've ever had in the story the grapes grapes are picked at midnight
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.580]   It was this whole thing. It's fascinating
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:04.420]   Anyway, that's perfect for the instagram generation. Oh and they have these unusual looking bottles
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.860]   No, I know I shouldn't be giving them a free ad but yeah, you have sugar free ad
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:11.380]   Don't subscribe especially there especially since they're not buying on the twig
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:16.100]   Don't subscribe until you hear the ad then use our code or whatever. I don't know right?
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:20.420]   Right, but no, I was really I was really impressed actually it was
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:25.060]   They're not aggregators. They're they're actually a winery in effect
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:26.500]   It's very interesting
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:34.100]   You think vera's gonna be a flash in the pan like all the other social networks that I joined and then never like mass remember massed it on
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.380]   Yeah, like from a week ago
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.260]   Remember them whatever happened to them
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.140]   what was the open source
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:51.220]   Uh facebook but hello hello. I'm still on hello. No one else is hello
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.740]   Oh, wait a minute. I went. Oh, yeah, you have to get hello. They don't even have their own domain name
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:03.780]   Or something like that. What is yellow? It's get yellow or say hello or it's elo.co
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:08.900]   I mean should I log into my elo? I think I
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:13.380]   Think I do still have a log is probably an open free of theirs has been
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.180]   Whatever happened to you
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:21.220]   I have joined so many bogus networks
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:28.820]   Let's see if there's yeah, there's still people oh they pivoted now. They're the creators network
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:37.060]   We're doing a quick survey to find out a little bit more about the artistic composition of the yellow community
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:39.620]   Hoping that you're artistic
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:42.740]   I'm a fan
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:44.260]   Submit
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:48.340]   They should have you be a patron. That sounds way better than yeah, I'm a patron
[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:55.780]   It implies you give money. So yeah, so there's nice stuff on elo. It's not it's it looks a little like Pinterest these days
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:02.740]   It's got lots of stuff all arts art stuff on
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:06.420]   All right, it's dead
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:08.900]   Sorry
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:11.060]   We've been car dash fascinated
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.900]   Next week. I'll have all kinds of the meat the meat
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.140]   Major where are the meat?
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:24.580]   The meat hanger well done here. We're having a hard time. That's yeah, I'm sorry
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:30.020]   Uh next week. We'll be in austin texas. I will not be here. Jason how we'll be uh handling the show
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:34.980]   Stacey Jeff will be there. I hope but I will be flying down to see you stacey
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:40.420]   The panel that stacey's going to be moderating at the uh at antons at the capital one house
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:45.140]   Uh, you may be moderating but I will be doing the ads if that's okay with you stacey
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:51.300]   Oh, yes, and if you I just I was surprised you may moderate the panel if you'd like I just was like oh
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:57.860]   I know I should I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the expectation is. I think where where does the audience get the most
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:03.540]   Value of your knowledge. I think we should just all talk at once. Nobody should moderate it
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.380]   Uh
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:09.620]   We'll figure it out. I didn't even thought of that to be honest. You should moderate it. Absolutely
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:13.540]   But I need to do the uh mechanics of it because it's a twit special
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:16.020]   Yes, yes, I
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:21.460]   Afterwards, I was like, oh, of course he's gonna moderate not necessarily moderate, but I'll introduce it. I'll introduce you
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:24.020]   I will uh do the ads
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:28.500]   But I will let you run the questions and and the answers
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.100]   Lisa just told me I'm moderating it

[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:46.340]   I'll be like here's a question for y'all go apparently I'm
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:52.180]   You know, it's gonna be it's loose moderation

[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:13.700]   You can make fun of the way boys talk that doesn't bother me
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.380]   Jeff does that bother you well. Well. Yeah, geez
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:25.300]   Like, you know, I can't do any voices anymore. They're all offensive to somebody so all purple

[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:15.460]   Yeah, I think that's kind of cool. I'm it's it'll not understand me at all. Well, it's computer generated
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.860]   So it will be amusing to say the least
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:24.740]   As it tries to figure out what I've been trying so with my my tennis elbow. I was trying to use dictation in google
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:27.380]   Docs. Yeah, it's really bad
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:35.140]   Really? I thought it'd be really great. Oh, it's really well the google assistant android does well, but but
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.780]   Docs
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:39.940]   It's it's really weird
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:42.900]   The hardest thing for google doc dictation is
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:47.620]   Is thinking the right way to say what you're trying to write as with all of this stuff
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:51.620]   I was just reading stuff. I'm from all that pile of books. I have over there
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:55.140]   I'm taking i've got 85 pages of notes that i'm
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:57.620]   Transcribing quotes, right
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:00.660]   So I luckily today I found something that was in the gutenberg project
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.700]   Oh, so I could just cut and paste out of it what I wanted to
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.420]   Yeah, somebody's taken the time to type it in for you
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.100]   Thanks
