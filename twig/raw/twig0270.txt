[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.120]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, CUNY.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   Welcome back, mate.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Hey, thank you.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   I had said, I love London.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   Yeah, it's a great time.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.320]   It looked like you had a good time.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   I had a great time.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   Good for you.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.480]   That was the best thing you did.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.960]   Even song at St. Paul's.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Oh.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.520]   So you go to St. Paul's, which is the beautiful Cathedral Christopher Wren built in the 17th
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   century.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240]   It's in the old town, the city of London.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.080]   And it's just a beautiful cathedral.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.800]   And then you can go up to the dome, which is really cool.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   And a beautiful view.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.640]   Did a bunch of panos.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.520]   And then at five o'clock, they do even song.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   And I was going to do even song either Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.320]   We were at St. Paul's.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   And it was so neat.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   So five o'clock, they chased the tourists out.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.880]   And I said, but we want to stay for the service.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.560]   They said, oh, yes, of course.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   So you sit there very nicely.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.240]   And then the minister came over and said, we've got 70 seats in the choir.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.040]   You know, that's the wooden, the QU-I-R-E.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   The wooden seats that the lords and ladies, it was where the royal wedding was held.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.920]   Not Kate and Harry's or Will's or whoever, but Charles and Diana's wedding was.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   So you remember probably that all the fancy people sitting in these beautiful wooden
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   seats.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   Unsouptable, no doubt.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440]   Yeah, and creaky.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.320]   But we all got 70 of us got to sit there.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.400]   And then the boys choir comes in and they're sitting there right there next to you and singing.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.240]   And it was the most beautiful thing.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.200]   So yeah, it's really great.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   Really neat.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   Really enjoyed that.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   It was very, very beautiful to hear a boy's choir, a really good boy's choir up close.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.720]   Also the change in the guard was fun of all things.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   You were a tourist.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.360]   I did all the tourist stuff.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   I did the one and I.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   You bet.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Like the eye.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.120]   I mean, you know, the giant, giant thing in the middle of the, but it's like a credible
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   views.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.120]   It's not scary.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   It moves.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   It merged so slowly that they don't stop.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.800]   Yeah, you get up there.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.960]   My palm starts where I'll be stuck up there for an hour.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   That stuck, it moves.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.560]   It's like this is half an hour and it goes all the way around.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.080]   I don't like things that happen slowly either.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's like right.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You know what?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.800]   The do it or move or don't, right?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   I am with you.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.640]   Somebody who some comics that a Ferris wheel combines.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.440]   I think it was Jimmy Fallon, the worst of both worlds terror and boredom.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   It was fun.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.920]   And then Tower of London and, you know, just all the usual tourist things.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   It was really double decked.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   You really did it up.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.000]   We only had four days.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.240]   I had Toad and a hole.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.400]   Didn't have bangers and match that toad and a hole, which is a sausage stuck into a Yorkshire
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   pudding.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000]   It might mash potatoes, so it's kind of like everything.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.880]   That's the only English thing I had.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.000]   Everything else we went to French restaurants.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And wonderful food.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The food London is fabulous.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.600]   The food in London now going from a horrible, horrible food city to a great food city.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   It's an amazing story.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.960]   Had a great time.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.840]   I love London.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.280]   And I apologize because so many people so kindly asked to, you know, I got an email from
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.360]   a guy who drives the tube, drives an underground car and said, would you like to ride in front
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.080]   of the train sometime?
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.120]   And I mean, so many people said, you know, would you like to come up in the gherkin or
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.160]   the shard?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.040]   And we were there so, such a short time that we just did the tourist thing and that was
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   it.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   Just Lisa and me just hardcore touristy.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.040]   We didn't, the only weird thing is we're walking real quickly down the street.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   We have a restaurant reservation.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.480]   We're going over to the West End and Will Harris is like at a bar just standing there.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.920]   The one guy I know lives in England says, Hey, I said, Will give him a hug and then we
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   had to go.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.760]   So that's it.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.240]   All right.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.880]   Let's talk right now as we speak, HTC is doing another bizarre event.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.600]   They've announced a new desire.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   Is it the desire I phone, which is an all plastic waterproof HTC phone with 13 megapixel, 13
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   megapixel out.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.520]   Remember now the HTC one is they made a big deal about having four megapixels, but they're
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.440]   ultra pixels.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   Now they finally realize nobody wanted that.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.040]   So it's 13 megapixels in the back, but also 13 megapixels in the front and flash on both
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   sides.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.560]   So it's the ultimate selfie cam.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.640]   It's like the ultimate selfie.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.720]   It's just a good front facing camera, which is all you really need for a good sell.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.280]   No flip out screens, no crazy software.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.320]   It's just it's just a 13 megapixel camera for front facing.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   As it should be.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.120]   They are HTC's famous for the software that they add in their phones.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.320]   You have an HTC one, but you're using the Google play edition or you used to anyway.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.560]   I used to right.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.760]   I've got the OnePlus one right now, but yeah, I was using the HTC one M8.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.360]   It got it got destroyed by the infant I live with, but I loved it.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.200]   Great phone, great phone.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.840]   But that the their megapixel front and back, that's something I really would like that appeals
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   to the company.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.200]   What do you finish to do to it to destroy a phone?
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.520]   It's not actually easy to destroy a phone, except of course an iPhone, but it isn't.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   It isn't.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   That's a solid phone.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.560]   You know, she I heard her banging something really hard on the floor and like didn't look
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   up fast enough.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   Like she was really like, yeah.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.160]   And then the screen just never came on after that.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   Eddas has some real skills.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.760]   Yeah, she knows she loves the phone.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.840]   She always wants the phone.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   She wants the phone.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   She wants the tablet.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.720]   But yeah, we had to have a few discussions about not banging it on the floor.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.440]   You know, we naturally sort of use, you know, like tend to handle these devices with a little
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.960]   bit with a little bit of reverence.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.800]   Even me, I mean, I'm against cases.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.360]   I feel like these computers are here for us to use.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   I want the computer to be there for me and not for me to adapt to the computer.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.920]   But I still am sort of very carefully handled it.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.480]   She has no such instincts about it.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.680]   That's actually great.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   It's very telling, isn't it?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680]   It's very interesting.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.280]   HTC also announced they're going to do new software, new camera software for all HTC
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.680]   One owners and a new Zoe will be on iPhone as well as Android.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   And that's a good idea.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.720]   I think the Zoe, which is one of the features I really like about the HTC One, it takes
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.640]   a movie and stills at the same time.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.120]   I think it's a really nice feature and it would be great on an iPhone.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.640]   So we'll keep watching and let you know if anything else is announced, but the HTC
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.960]   doing its event right now.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   And we're...
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.560]   Show still on.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.880]   We were watching just before the show.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   And I just don't understand why these companies do this.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.800]   Who's that to appeal to?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.440]   You got a bunch of 50 tech journalists.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.320]   They don't want to see a fashion show, especially bad fashion.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.720]   I just, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.680]   It's like just get a great speaker with a lot of personality, someone like you, Leo,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.160]   who's got just a great voice and can project enthusiasm and but sort of clearly explain
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   something.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   It doesn't have to be the CEO necessarily.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   In fact, I don't know.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   Sometimes I think it shouldn't be the CEO.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   No.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   It shouldn't be.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160]   Just get someone good who explains what the product is and that's it.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   You know what?
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   It's weird.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:31.040]   But I think it's partially a cultural thing too.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.680]   I guess I don't get it.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.800]   It's an idea that it's got to be a big show.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.720]   Yeah, mock show.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   Well, we'll try to parse the fashion show and give you the actual tech facts as they
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   emerge.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.040]   Pause the fashion show.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.600]   What is they talking about?
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.800]   Why are they doing this?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Why?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.920]   Well, we could talk phones.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   Moto X.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.120]   Now you guys, you're still using the one plus one and I have to say I've really attempted
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.760]   to go back to the one plus one for one reason.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.320]   The battery life, the 20 hour battery life is so nice.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   This is 12.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.800]   Oh, no, I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   12 doesn't make it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.960]   I don't care if you get a leather bag.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.000]   The one thing, it's the one thing that did really well on this thing.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.360]   The one is kind of very generic, right?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   It's just like, it's a, it doesn't, it doesn't scream anything.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   It has no soul.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.400]   It has no soul, but it goes all day.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.320]   It has a hacker soul.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.320]   Talk to me about the hints.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.080]   That's what I want to hear about Leo.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.800]   I couldn't get it to work.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.640]   Oh, Jason had it last night, but he said, this has been in Leo's ear and I am not going
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   to put it in my ear.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   Well, then I want to tell.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.000]   I'm talking about it on Twitter.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.160]   So yeah, I got the hint.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.080]   So of the three, I like the Moto 360 the best.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.640]   I think it is the best smartwatch.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.400]   Of all out there right now.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.640]   The phone, if it had good battery life would be good.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.920]   I did a review on before you buy and I wasn't able, I had reprogrammed it to be something
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.960]   like, okay, Moto X and it never would, it just wouldn't wake up.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.280]   So I went back to, okay, Google now.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   Okay, Google now.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.440]   Well, it's still not listening very well.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.240]   Didn't you change it to wake up?
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.360]   No, I changed it back.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   It said for best results.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.600]   Like what is your password?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.880]   Is there a way to remind yourself of the word you put it?
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Yes.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   Oh no.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.560]   In fact, they say they make you enter it in as text before you go on because they know
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.440]   that you will forget what it is.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   And you know, people are, you know, a lot of the people in Motorola were having, we're
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.320]   going, hello Jarvis.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.000]   One thing I've learned from the new iPhone, you know, the new iPhone wakes up when you
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.360]   say, hey Siri, but only if it's under power.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.240]   And one thing I've learned from that is that's too short a phrase because it wakes up when
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.280]   I'm listening to an audio book, it wakes up when I'm talking, it wakes up when President
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.960]   Obama says the word Syria on the TV.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   Siri goes, what?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   What?
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.600]   So that's too short.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   So, and then they say this on the Moto X, if when you're programming it, make it, in fact,
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.280]   they'll even say, no, that's too short.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.120]   More syllables is better and probably more distinct syllables, but it doesn't work very
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120]   well in the hint.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.200]   Super counter-fragilistic, I see all the doses.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Try that.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Okay.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Okay.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Okay.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Google now.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah, there it worked.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.720]   That's five syllables Leo.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.080]   Okay, Google now.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   You came up fast, Gina.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   Okay, Google now.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   Now it's working reliably.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.080]   Oh, look, a lot of talking.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.280]   Well, I know I liked it.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.240]   I wanted to say, okay, Moto X, that wasn't very reliable.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.360]   Anyway, okay, Google now seems to work.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.640]   Um, you train it and blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   Uh, it's calling somebody.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   No, stop.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.360]   Seriously, please.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.720]   It did that, didn't it do it that Chad, when we were doing it, when I was doing the review
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.160]   and before you buy it, I started calling.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   Chad said you're in a phone call.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   I said, what?
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.720]   And I had to hang up, well, whatever.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.520]   I'm sorry, but dial.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.880]   So the hint is the earpiece that makes the full set.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.600]   So you got the watch, you got the phone, you got the earpiece, you got the full legend.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.120]   The very armorset, the hint is very small, has no microphone protrusion or anything.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.320]   It just fits in your ear like a little gauge.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   That's not it.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   Look at all these leaves.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   It's not it.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   Is Jason here?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   No, it doesn't fall out.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   It's pretty good.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.120]   You kind of scrotin.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.640]   And has a face that will, if you wish, match the back, I got the brown cognac leather.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.840]   So it matched it.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.440]   Which doesn't really make you look more fashionable.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   It just makes you look kind of weird.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.920]   It's not as weird as the generic Bluetooth.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.080]   No, and it doesn't blink blue.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.840]   It's pretty unobtrusive.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.520]   And the sound is pretty good.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.360]   The problem is the microphone is in your ear.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.760]   So it never does seem to respond.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.600]   Can somebody go on Jason's desk and steal my hint back?
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   John will do it.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.040]   Because I want to show you.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.640]   It battery life, obviously on something the size of a dime, isn't very long.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.960]   Three hours.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.320]   But then you get a container that you put it in that has three that has two more charges.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.080]   So you charge the container overnight.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   You find it?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.400]   You charge a container overnight.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.040]   And it'll so and then so when you're not using the hint, which by the way will be dead
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   now because it discharges even when it's not in your ear.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   So you put it here.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   Oh, so you have to charge it like two or three times a day.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   That's what that blinking is.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   Well, that's another problem, by the way.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   It's a larger whoa.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.840]   So the charger is cool.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   That thing looks cool.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   It's a good idea.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   It's a good idea.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.440]   But I didn't realize you have to take that thing out of your ear and stick it in the
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.720]   charger through it two or three hours of talk time.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   It gets a little bit too.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   It gets a little bit too.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   Okay.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   I think it waxy.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   It's not waxy.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   I'm just joking.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   I know that looks pretty.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   There's some yellow something on there.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.200]   Oh, the yellow is the pogo pins for the.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.320]   Oh, we're getting real.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.920]   That's that's a quite a close up.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.240]   And but I'm not sure which is a microphone.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.480]   I think that's the microphone.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.560]   And the problem is that's in your ear.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.720]   You can touch this.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   So it'll work with any Bluetooth cable phone.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.400]   What's that little jammy on the on the outer on the brown part?
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   There's like a little hole there.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   I don't know if that's the mic or or this is the mic.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.480]   There's two different parts.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.560]   And maybe that's just a light.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.160]   I don't know.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.720]   You can tap it and wake the phone up, but you can also, if it's attached to a Moto X,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.560]   say, okay, Google now or whatever your phrase is, although it never was able to get that
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.880]   working because the microphone stuck in your ear.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.960]   So then I called my daughter and she said, I can't what what?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.440]   Can't what?
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   Hello.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.280]   So I think that's going to be retired.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.440]   Oh, and okay.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.720]   One more complaint.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.480]   It does you see it's glowing when it's charging the device and it goes solid when it's fully
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.480]   charged.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.480]   That's really bright.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.200]   It doesn't look bright in here, but in a darkened bedroom.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   That's a flashlight.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.440]   I mean, it's that bright.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.480]   And so this you and it's the breathing.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   And it's breezy.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   Okay.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   That is not conducive to sleep.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   There's a Mac.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   Not the recent models, but there was a model of Mac that did that when it was charging.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.440]   It would be and it would make my better half and yeah, crazy.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.840]   She would cover it in shirts like she would just like it could not be in the bedroom.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.840]   This can't be in the bedroom.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   You have to charge us in another room.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.040]   But it makes it easy to find on the bright side.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.120]   It also senses that it's in your ear.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.600]   So you don't have to push any buttons.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.720]   It just makes it says, it's made some music because the thing that obsessed me most about
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.520]   about ear pieces is that when I'm trying to hold it in my ear so I can hear better,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   of course, that's the off button.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   Right.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.800]   It's telling me go to Bluetooth menu on device to complete pairing.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.080]   So because it's not paired, I'm going to go to Bluetooth and I'm going to say pair this
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.880]   search for devices.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   So that's the nice thing.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.680]   Pairing is very easy, very quick.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.280]   And now it's going to be paired.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.760]   It'll pair to two different phones.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.240]   So you could pair this if you had another phone or actually I've paired it to my computer.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   Okay.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.280]   So now it's saying paired wants to access my, my address book.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   So let's just see now.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.360]   Okay, Google now.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's working.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   Maybe I just had a phrase.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   It wasn't great.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   Okay, Google now.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.880]   Well, watch is listening.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.120]   You should speak to it.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   What?
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.320]   Oh, I have too many things listening.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.560]   Okay, Google now.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   Oh, see, the watch is responding.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.600]   Watch is doing it.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   Crap.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:02.120]   Okay, they obviously haven't fully thought this out yet.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.600]   Those, the reviews have been fairly positive, but I don't think it's because I think the
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.040]   reviews actually haven't used it.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.840]   I don't think it's usable.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   So that's too bad.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.040]   I mean, but on the other hand, remember, when you're using stuff like this, you're on the
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   cutting edge.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.960]   You're using new stuff and you can expect some bumps along the way.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.560]   I wouldn't recommend this for somebody who just wants a Bluetooth earpiece.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   I was listening to an audio book.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.640]   It was great because it's so small.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.840]   It just sits there.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   It's kind of fun.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   All right.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.680]   The reason I bring this up is because next week, right?
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   That's the rumor.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:41.960]   Jeff, next week, Shamu comes out rumor rumor, rumor, Nexus six, which is rumored to be
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:47.200]   a almost six inch version of this, the Moto X.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.480]   With great specs.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:54.360]   If it, yeah, a better, more RAM, three gigs of RAM, bigger screen, 5.9 inch, I think,
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   screen.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   I have nine.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   It's pretty big.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.480]   It's smaller, it's a little smaller than the, than the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   Mondo six, right?
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   The iPhone.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   Still smaller than the iPhone six plus.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   They have big bezels.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   I like big bezels.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   I cannot lie.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.080]   Um, no, no, no, the six plus is five five, isn't it?
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.200]   Five and a half inches, but the phone, the total phone size is bigger than the rumored
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.960]   size for Shamu because of the bezels.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   Oh, gotcha.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   Okay.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.760]   Um, anyway, if it has better battery life, it might be a good pick.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.720]   Because I'll tell you what, if this had the same battery life as the one plus one, I'd
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.280]   say it's equivalent to or even maybe better because it listens.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   You know, I like this.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.600]   I like the little things that it does.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.920]   I'm sorry that they went to five point two inches, four point seven was really great.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.840]   But yeah, the battery life on the one plus one is pretty great.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.680]   I'm pretty spoiled at this point.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   That's the one thing.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   No, that was it.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.200]   That's the one thing.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   That's the one thing about that.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   That's the one plus one.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.840]   By the way, the one plus one screen is, is I believe and others do too, the same part
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.040]   as in the iPhone five, a six plus.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Really?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.320]   Exactly the same size.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   It's definitely, it's got all the same specs.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   It's the same.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.280]   I think it's the same part.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.840]   It's the in cell touch and all that stuff.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.160]   So if you asked me what I should do, what you should do, I'd say wait for sure.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.960]   I'm going to go to the Shambo and see.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.200]   I think that's where I'm heading.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.960]   Not that there's anything wrong with the one plus one.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.840]   And for the price, that's the phone to go with.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.760]   And I'm sad to say, I would say try helps for the Moto X.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.320]   I'm going to keep using it because Hope Springs eternal.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.680]   I give you a little small watch update.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yes.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.120]   So if you have the latest update on the watch itself, you can now turn it on.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.760]   Turn ambient back on and it will last all day.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.920]   I did that and you're right.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.640]   They fixed the battery pretty well.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   Yes.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.800]   That latest update really did make a huge difference.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.480]   And then I found a little program called Intellicon watch face.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.840]   Have you played with some of the third party watch face?
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Absolutely.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.280]   This one's great because it lets you, you can have a Ferrari logo.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.240]   It had some features.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.880]   This is the battery life of the watch is displayed on the watch now.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.120]   You can have this stay awake for five seconds or ten seconds after you turn it on.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.640]   That of course will kill the battery.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   And that is you can programmable.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.040]   That's East Coast time as you probably recognize since it's your time.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.960]   So and all of this is programmable.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.400]   So you can make any face you want, which is kind of nice.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   So I'm going to be in Seoul next week.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   Yes.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.000]   And the LGR goes on sale in Korea on Monday.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You should pick it up.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Oh, you should.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.720]   I think it's expensive, right?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.960]   250 something like that.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.760]   Well, I haven't bought one yet.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.600]   So, you know, I got too free.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.560]   Come on, you better.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.760]   The LG are it's a the round one.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.320]   And I know flat tire problem because it has the watch.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.400]   Well, it has a flat tire.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   You just can't see it.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.160]   Well, yeah, but that's clever.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.360]   Yeah, that's yeah, that the flat tire doesn't exist if no one can see it.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.760]   Doesn't bother me.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.640]   I would rather see more of the watch and have the flat tire than less of the watch with
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   no flat tire.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.880]   In effect, it's got a flat tire all the way around.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   The bezels hiding.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   Is this a thicker bezel?
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.280]   Yeah, all the way around.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.920]   I think it's I don't know.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   All right.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.440]   So there's your follow up really.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.600]   I was just stealing all about Androids thunder.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   I'm sure you talked about all of this last night.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   We did.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   We did talk about a lot of it.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   But, you know, we're all interested.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   We're interested.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   We're interested in Androids.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   But let's talk about Google.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   What do you say?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.280]   We're going to do that in a second.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.960]   But I'm going to take a break.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.440]   As soon as we come back, we'll have some Google stuff and we'll have their Google change
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.200]   log.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.120]   I want to ask you about some fascinating journalistic stories, Jeff Jarvis, because you're our
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.080]   King of journalism.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.480]   I presume you both read Kathy Sierra's post of yesterday.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.480]   God.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   I'm doing the ad, Jeff.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.000]   We're running run to what is her pony?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Serious, serious pony.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Serious pony.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Come run to serious pony and read it.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.440]   She says she's going to take it down soon.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.920]   So you might want to read it now, Jeff.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.400]   And we could talk about that a little bit.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   I'll drop it in the doc.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   Jeff.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.480]   More of that troll stuff, Jeff.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.600]   And it's just, you know, it breaks my heart.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.840]   Just breaks my heart and I think it may be down.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.840]   Really?
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.200]   Presentation skills considered harmful.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   No.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.960]   She didn't link to it from her blog was kind of like a hidden link.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   Oh, maybe it's hidden.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   Okay.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   I'll, I'll hunt that down.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   You do the read it.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   It's in the chat room too.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.240]   Patterson just posted in the chat.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.320]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at hover.com.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.920]   H-O-V-E-R.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.640]   When you have a great idea, what's the first thing you say to yourself?
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   At least in this digital era, what I say is let's get the domain name, right?
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   You want something catchy, you want something memorable.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.880]   Online entity is so important.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   In fact, nowadays people don't name a company.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.520]   Sometimes they don't even name their kids without checking first to see if they get
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   the domain name.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.480]   Well, hover is the place to go to get the job done.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.240]   You'll find the perfect domain for your idea.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.640]   So you can get to work on it.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.680]   And right now is the perfect time to start a new project.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.200]   Harvard has just lowered the price on more than 200 domain name extensions, including
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   many TLDs.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.920]   They also reduce the price for new.com domain names is now 1299.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   Who is that includes?
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.320]   You might say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.360]   I can get it for less than that."
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.760]   But they'll upsell you.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   Hover does not do that.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.360]   They include who is privacy free.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.200]   So when you add up the prices, you'll see hovers very, very affordable.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.040]   It's the best price out there.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.120]   1299 for a .com, including who is privacy, which you must have.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.280]   Now it is.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.880]   People love how the hover geeks, developers, designers, programmers.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.800]   They all know that hovers are going to give them the domain management tools they want,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   the email redirection tools they want.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.680]   It's so easy to use, so easy to find a domain name.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.520]   All you do is search those keywords and you'll get a variety of options with many, many different
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.240]   extensions that you can try.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.120]   Of course, they've got .com.net.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.800]   That's a good one to try if you can't get the .com, but also .ninja.everything.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.400]   This week in Google, let's search for a chat.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   Oh, look, see, it's searching now through 237 different top level domains.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.120]   They take all the friction and hassle out of registering your domain.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.480]   Can't get this week in Google.com.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.760]   What a surprise.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.280]   But you can get .net.org.info.link.xyz website today.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.840]   Zone Biz.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.720]   This week in Google.city.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.560]   I like it.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.080]   Guru.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.840]   There's all sorts of great choices at hovers.com.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.280]   They even offer a free valet transfer service.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   If you've already got the domain name, but you want to take advantage of their excellent
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:19.120]   management system and their good way of doing business, you can transfer all of your existing
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.520]   domains over for free.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.400]   They do it all for you.

[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.080]   DNS settings.

[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.920]   You pay $10 for a year's renewal.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   That's really great.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920]   Hover's honest.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.080]   They don't believe in heavy handed up selling.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.640]   They include everything you need.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.480]   No more, no less.

[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.680]   Nice guys too.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.200]   Nice guys and gals, a well run site.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.880]   Who is, tell us who Kathy Sierra is, Gina?
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.800]   Kathy is a technologist and an author of many educational programming books for years and
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.320]   years and years early, early blogger.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   Great writer.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   Just a powerful writer.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   Great writer.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.160]   Great speaker, a teacher.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.680]   I would call her a teacher but in technology.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.960]   And short, long story short, 2007, she is, you know, people are starting to pay attention
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.240]   to her work because she does really good work and she gets trolled by an infamous troll
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.760]   and horribly attacked by tons of people who docks her and publish her social security
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:11.640]   number and home address and a bunch of lies about her family and her kids and her work.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.880]   And she goes offline because she's afraid for her safety and for her family safety.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.120]   And she comes back online.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.600]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.680]   Last year, 2013, I think, under a different handle, serious pony.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.040]   And starts to publish a little bit more.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   And I don't know.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.760]   Maybe I should, I should pass this over to you.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.760]   Her troll was involved in a court case.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.360]   We've, we've, right, was involved in a court case.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   And this is the thing.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.680]   And this is where I got a little bit of trouble because weaves, the case against weave was
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   terrible.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.640]   It was another one of those Department of Justice bogus prosecutions.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Right.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.320]   It was a computer fraud and abuse act, right?
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   It was overreach.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.440]   I mean, it was the, it was, it was a terrible lawsuit.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.200]   But this guy's, but we have a hideous person.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   He's hideous.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   Exactly.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.280]   He was the guy who apparently doxed Kathy Sierra.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.680]   He admitted it in the New York Times.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   Now he denies it.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   Now he denies it.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.320]   He admitted it.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.360]   Not a nice person, really kind of in many ways.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.880]   And she talks about this, not just a troll, but a sociopathic troll with real skills.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.720]   That's kind of the worst possible.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.320]   Extremely, extremely manipulative.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.160]   Yes, just a constant liar.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.040]   And you know, what got hard, what got difficult for her and what I can't imagine must have
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.320]   been surreal for her is that, you know, a lot of people in the tech community, so, you
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.600]   know, were against the case against him, right?
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.320]   It was a bad case against him separate from what he did for her.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.480]   We were torn because this was, you know, he downloaded, he, it turned out 18 to he had
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.320]   misconfigured its servers and you could get emails of customers, iPad users, very simply
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   with a script.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   So he did it.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.080]   He downloaded something like 114,000 addresses.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.200]   As far as anybody knows, never did anything malicious with him.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.840]   Although that doesn't, I mean, given his personality, I don't know, but the prosecution
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:07.520]   seemed misguided and they were really going for the works.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.160]   On the other hand, it's hard not to celebrate this getting this guy in jail because he's
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   a creep.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   Right.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   Because he's a horrible creep.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.600]   Anyway, what she's talking about in this, and it's a very powerful article is how, you
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.160]   know, this happened to her 10 years ago.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.120]   And it's gotten worse and worse.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.800]   And yeah, and she's making an interesting point because, you know, I'm the one who says,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.280]   well, just ignore them, they'll go away.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.280]   She says it doesn't work.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.800]   She has a great list here.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.360]   You know, your choices.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.920]   One leave, they win.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.000]   Two ignore them.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.280]   They escalate, make more miserable, DDoS, ruin your career, et cetera.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   They win.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   Three fight back.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.200]   If you've already hit the Kool Aid point, which I'll describe in a second, see option
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   two, they win.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.480]   The Kool Aid point is brilliant.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.280]   I think it's a real insightful point, which is that it's not so much that your troll hates
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   you, the troll hates the attention you're getting, and you don't deserve that in your
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   role.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.640]   Especially if you're a woman, especially if you're a woman in tech, then you really don't
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   deserve it.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   Right.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   That's the logic.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   Right.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.000]   And so this campaign with crediting begins.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.240]   You slept your way to the top.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.080]   You made all this up.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   You're actually, you know, whatever.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   All the things.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.840]   And actually Anita Sarkeesian did this great talk at XOXO about how the ways in which trolls
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.680]   kind of discredit women and all those things were done to Kathy, just lies basically about
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   her.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   And things would escalate.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.800]   Like she posted this blog comment, a comment on a blog saying that she supported people
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.000]   who moderated their blog comments.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.080]   And that escalated into this giant lie about how she had issued DMCA complaints against
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.400]   websites and had people censored.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.760]   And so she herself was a censor and against like net, you know, a free and open web.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.040]   And people would just, these stories would just sort of grow and the meme would catch
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   on.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.360]   And then suddenly she was someone who hated, you know, a free and open web because she
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.560]   had said in a blog comment, she thought someone should be able to moderate the comments
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   on their own blog.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.800]   I mean, like insane, surreal.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.280]   I cannot believe what this woman has been through kind of moments.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   And the thing, I mean, it is surreal and it's beyond appalling and disgusting.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.680]   And she's felt, you know, fear for her life and such.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   And it's extreme.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.240]   Well, but it's not really an outlier.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.880]   That's the point.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.480]   Well, yeah, what I was saying is it might seem like an extreme.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   There's a lot of that.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.200]   There's also a lot that's short of that that is also irritating and difficult and not good
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   for the net.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.880]   Well, and if you wonder why there aren't more women in tech, because I think there are very
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.440]   few women publicly visible women in tech who haven't experienced this in some form or
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   fashion.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.800]   In my very few, very, very few.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   You know, one of our think-ups investors, the mess, DM me and said, have you ever experienced
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.080]   anything like this?
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.160]   It just seems like, you know, you're a little more visible.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   Is this common?
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.600]   And I was like, oh, I can tell you stories.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.200]   And I've talked about it a little bit here.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.000]   And I won't go into my whole thing.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.120]   But I love that Cathy made, she differentiated between, and this is something I know that's
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   like subjective.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.040]   And you know, when you see it, but she differentiated between like mean being mean to someone and
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.280]   then stalking them, right?
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.800]   There's like saying to someone like, you know, you're fat and stupid online is like someone
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   being mean on the internet, okay, block, ignore, whatever.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:39.960]   And then there's like, I've taken a photo of your child and superimposed them on a porn
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.000]   image and published that or, you know, I've published your home address and it encouraged
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.240]   other people, egged other people on to go show up there, right?
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.440]   And there's a difference between those two things.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:34:00.720]   She talks about trolls posting flashing images in epileptic forums designed to, you know,
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.920]   to put people in fits.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.360]   Yeah, to induce seizures.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   To induce seizures.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.160]   And it's for the lulls and that makes it okay.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.120]   And people go, oh, well, that's terrible, but that's sure funny.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   It's not.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.440]   It's horrible.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   It's horrible behavior.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.460]   And the reason I bring it up, you know, I mean, look, if you're a celebrity, if you're
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:28.440]   a movie star, this happens all the time and the general thing is just not to mention it.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.040]   Not to, you know, you have security, you'll go to the police, you know, if there's a fear
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.720]   for your life or a tangible threat and they will, because your celebrity, they will prosecute
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.800]   and we see that happen.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.480]   But what we don't see happen is this kind of continuous drumbeat that goes on all the
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.760]   time.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.120]   What's changed is now, first of all, it's many, many, many, many more people are exposed
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   to it.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.080]   And the tools for doing it like, and Twitter comes up again and again in this and Kathy
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.240]   talks about Twitter.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.520]   Our new technological tools really facilitate this.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.440]   And I'm starting to feel like we're taking a really bad turn here.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   It's a lot.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.320]   You know, a couple of weeks ago, I said, you know, we had the case of the Naked Celebrity
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.280]   Photos and the Beheadian videos.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.880]   And I argued on this show, I don't know if it was last week when you were off, Leo, but
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.680]   I argued that we might be heading to a point where I saw people say it's wrong to share
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680]   them.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   It's wrong to look at them.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.360]   And I saw the beginnings of a norm come out.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.080]   That's among civilized people.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.760]   There's a huge swath of people who aren't civilized or who are in fact, and we've had this story
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.600]   on two trolls, our psychopaths.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.240]   They all says that as well.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.600]   She says that as well that we have as a sociopath.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.400]   You know, I'm going to get, I'm going to get in huge trouble here.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.320]   I'm going to make it an equivalency that I don't mean to make at all.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   Okay.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.760]   And I don't want to also want to mention this guy again, at all.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   But, but my little mini thing of my imposter who promised to change the name, hasn't not
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.920]   a man of his word.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.760]   He just went into L.O. and used my name there.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.600]   You know, this is a guy who has a respectable job in a company with trust in his name.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.280]   That's all I'll say.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   And I can't trust him.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.760]   He is not a man of his word.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.280]   He's, he's a lying little creep.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.320]   And now all we're not going to say is that I guess what's going to happen.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.920]   I'll get crap now for now.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.360]   I don't have any humor and I'm not using that.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.200]   F you all.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.000]   You know, it's just the fact that people think they have a right to irritate other people.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   The fact that if you're in any, the weirdest part of the pathology of this is interesting
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.920]   to me is that if you are in the least bit famous, people think that they can go after
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.040]   you by least bit famous now means that you publish anything to the public.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.600]   That means if you have a Twitter account, it means if you don't blog.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.800]   And that's kind of what Kathy Sierra is saying is just by sticking your head up in the world
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.360]   means that people are going to want to try to cut you down.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Yes.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.840]   But especially if you're a woman who sticks her head up, that's really not okay.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   Right.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.640]   If the first time in history and in culture, we have a whole group of people who are like
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.520]   famous enough to not have bodyguards, but famous enough to have stalkers.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   Right.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.000]   And the system isn't built to deal with them.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.480]   And I know I went to the police when I was when I had had my guy and they couldn't do
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   anything.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.360]   You know, like you have to have whatever.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.200]   I won't go into the details, but they basically are just not not equipped and can't help you
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.400]   unless they're very specific.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   They're not interested.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   They're not interested.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   They're not equipped.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.360]   There's bigger, bigger things going on in the world.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   I guess.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:29.920]   You know, you know, I mean, Leo, you went through this a little bit when when the issue happened
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.720]   with your daughter, you know, it's like you have to have a documentation of a credible
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   threat within your state.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.960]   And it has to be said in a certain way that there's no way that you can be misinterpreted
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.000]   in any other way, you know, and these guys know how to, you know, skirt, skirt the line
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.760]   and send you creepy pictures and write things about you that make you know that they they
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.760]   know all these things about you, right, without making a direct threat.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.160]   I mean, there's it's and you know, the police, they're like, print out the emails and the
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.160]   tweets.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   I mean, literally, like that's what's that's what goes on.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.560]   That's the level level that they're at.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.000]   So they're useless.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.320]   The, you know, Jennifer Lawrence said it's a sex crime.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   It's not even a crime.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   It's a sex crime.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   I don't know.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   We can debate that.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.280]   But I think she's amazing response.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.840]   Her response to that whole situation, the fact that she said that was a sex crime and
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.520]   anyone who looked at my photos without my permission was perpetuating that crime.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:30.120]   That was just such a huge, I mean, she's the first celebrity, you know, every other celebrity
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.280]   is generally women, right, who's had leak nudes have apologized.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.480]   Oh, it was a lapse in judgment.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.600]   I'm very sorry.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   They were shameful.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.840]   Scarlett Johansson kind of played it all.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   It was a skull of Johansson.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.280]   I forget which one was like, oh, I know my best angle was kind of coy about it.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.800]   I love that Jennifer Lawrence came straight up and said, I was about to write an apology.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.520]   And then I thought, I don't have anything to apologize for.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.040]   This was a sex crime.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   That was incredible.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.640]   That interview was in a vatte fair.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.960]   Ironically, he owned by the same company that owns Reddit, which I doubt she knew.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.380]   She might have thought about going somewhere else to do this.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.720]   But nevertheless, it got the attention it deserved.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.320]   And you can't disagree with her.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.440]   Here's the reason I bring this up.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:19.080]   We had such high hopes for the internet as of being a democratizing medium.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.960]   And a number of people said, even in the earliest days, yeah, but it's going to give
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   people of who shouldn't have a voice, a voice.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.320]   And I always said, you know, if it's in the light of day, this stuff, the really bad stuff
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.120]   has to stay under a rock to survive in the light of day and the free, you know, agora,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   the marketplace.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.600]   It'll go away.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   It'll shrivel up.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.840]   It'll dry up in the sun.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.120]   And the true nature of humans will triumph.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.840]   And I'm afraid I was really wrong.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.920]   And it's very sad to me.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.560]   I'm not ready to give up, not by a long shot.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.280]   Again, I point to Jennifer Lawrence case.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.840]   I think that people, all at all rallied around.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.280]   You didn't see them spread all around.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.600]   You heard people say, no, don't even look at them.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.000]   That would be wrong.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.480]   There are always going to be trolls, assholes, sickos, creeps, idiots, crud buckets in the
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.040]   world, right?
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   They're always going to be there.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040]   They always have been.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   They always will be.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   Now you're right.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.280]   You're pointing making the internet makes it more visible only because we link to them.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.160]   Only because we say, Hey, look at the fight fight.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   Look over at that.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   Well, don't we need to.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   You got their fault.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.720]   You said norms would fix this, but norms aren't fixing this.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.600]   Not yet. No, but I'm saying, but this takes time.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.680]   Insert Gutenberg lecture here, 150 years to invent the newspaper.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.640]   It takes time for these norms to take over.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:56.680]   When I was researching the telegraph, and I've got, from my, from 1868 to 1885, they still
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   hadn't figured it out.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.000]   The telegraph was still causing people problems.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.880]   There were still, oh my God, people were getting married over the telegraph and this
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   is dangerous.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.200]   Women have to stay away from the telegraph.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.040]   1865 women have to stay away from the telegraph because it'll expose them to the course corners
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   of the world on New York Times letters set.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.880]   Yeah, but imagine what that New York Times writer would think today about the course corners
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.040]   of the world.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:26.520]   Yeah, but but but but but a don't don't for part of the problem is so I spent my flight
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.760]   back from from San Francisco last week, right in an essay that I'm trying to play somewhere
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:36.040]   in German media, I'm starting with the Frankfurt Algomannet site talking about the German problem.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.520]   And at the end of it, what I argue is that we've got to also have a discussion about the
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:46.720]   wonder and the entire discussion now has been taken over by the techno panics and the protectionists
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.920]   and the controllers and the negatives and the trolls.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.680]   There's also amazing and wonderful things going on with this net.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.960]   And I argue that we ought to have said on the show before, a world's fair of the net.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.400]   Yes, there's crap.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.680]   But there's also a countervailing wonder that's occurring that we're ignoring.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.720]   We're not talking about where we're looking at all the bad stuff that comes up.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.640]   We're allowing that to win the conversation.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:14.440]   And we're also it's the fault of the public for giving exposure to trolls imposters, bozos,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.680]   et cetera.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:22.440]   People need to get indignant and and instead of saying and Kathy Sierra points this out.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.920]   There's just kind of this general.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.760]   Oh, it must be some merit to what he's saying kind of a thing.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.760]   Right.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.760]   Right.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.640]   Because because you're public and public people deserve this.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.280]   You put yourself out there.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.560]   So you're exposed.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.480]   So what happens to slap you in the face you deserve?
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.400]   Obviously wrong, obviously ridiculous.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.600]   And we need more discussions.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   I mean, I'll make another horrid ridiculous equivalency that I don't mean to make a
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   equivalent.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.040]   But what do we hear the discussion about terrorism and Islam?
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.680]   Well, why don't we hear more Islam as well?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.120]   Well, we do.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.160]   But what gets attention is the terrorists.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.960]   It's the fault of media, to a great extent.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.840]   It's the fault of of conversations.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:10.160]   And you know, when you look at at at London, there were stories that when the the the Brit
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.600]   was beheaded, the is the Muslim community in the UK expressed outrage.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   Okay.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   So there's a story where it got there.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   You know, it's always been there.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   You know, it's been there.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   No, no doubt about that.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.800]   There's an hashtag not in our name.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   Yes.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   Right.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.720]   So it used the tools to try to turn around and and we need more of that.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   Exactly.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.840]   And we need the same thing with trolls.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.960]   We need that we need the problem is this is there was a really, you know, the catheter,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.200]   you know, horrible thing here.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.920]   What you pro the first step is we all have to ignore them.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:49.600]   If you point to a troll, you are equally guilty of whatever that troll has done full stop.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.800]   You are complicit trolls crime.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.280]   Oh, isn't that funny?
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Look at the fight.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   No, it's just laws.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   No sucker.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.040]   You just did it yourself.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.360]   You were an accomplice to the crime.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.800]   If you look at pictures of Jennifer Lawrence, you are committing a sex crime.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   She's right.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.600]   If you can't look at child porn, because it's wrong, then how can you look at the stolen
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   photo and say it's right?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.760]   You are responsible for the behavior.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.640]   So at a level of ignoring, we have to get to there.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.400]   Then there's the question of do we get to a level of condemnation?
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.600]   Does that just give the trolls what they want?
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:28.760]   Well, I kicked up a storm maybe, but at least we have to get to the level of ignoring.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.240]   And what we have to do is rather than shaming the troll, shame the people who point to the
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240]   troll, and I've done that.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.440]   I've gone to people and I've said, did you really want to give that guy attention?
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.320]   Did you really want to do that?
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.240]   And then people, reasonable people say, okay, yeah, you're right.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   That was wrong.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.720]   So we all have a responsibility to do that.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:52.640]   Or shame ignore the trolls and shame the troll promoters.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.040]   And that's using social norms to correct us.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.920]   And it, you know, if we don't succeed at this, if we don't succeed at this, everybody worthwhile
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.680]   is going to pull back.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.880]   We're going to lose the discourse.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.160]   We're going to lose the potential of the internet.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.760]   It'll become a wasteland because anybody who has any sense will just stay out of the public
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   eye.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   Yes.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.120]   And you don't want that.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:25.760]   You know, and you want women in the game industry, you want women in technology, you
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.120]   don't want women just to say, God, this is a crappy place to be.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.760]   I don't want to participate.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.240]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.480]   That's the kind of the insight that I had about all this.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.960]   And I have to say that Kathy's that that S issue really was everybody should read it.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.160]   If you have any doubt, if you say, Oh, no, this isn't that bad, read it and then take
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   decided.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.680]   It was definitely a bit of a reckoning for me, right?
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.720]   Because I mean, I build a product whose premise, think up whose premise is that participating
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.760]   on the public network is a good thing.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.680]   Period, right?
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.920]   And I don't know.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.160]   I mean, this, this, this situation, you know, I think of the more I think about it, the
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.880]   more I wonder about that.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.360]   I mean, I do believe that I want to believe that, but it gets harder when this stuff happens.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:14.720]   One of the insights that I've had is that the social networks that I love and feel safest,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.120]   especially around sharing are not public networks.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.760]   Like my favorite social network is a private mailing list that a friend of mine set up
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.200]   that is friends of friends.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.480]   Everybody knows someone else through someone other context.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.360]   And it's, and it's incredible.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.840]   And I, and I grow from it and it feeds my soul and it makes me feel happy and it makes
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.440]   you feel safe and I share and, and a similar thing, a friend of mine who has a tiny letter,
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.600]   which is a naked email newsletter.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.200]   And she, she wrote a response actually to Kathy's post saying that she, you know, she,
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.000]   she didn't have a public response, but these are some of the thoughts that are going through
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.160]   her head after reading three or four times.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   And that was one of those things.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.800]   I was like, okay, yes, this is, this is going on.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.760]   It was kind of, it was a level of discourse that wasn't going on in my public feeds.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.720]   I mean, part of it is that Twitter isn't, isn't fit for long form discourse because it's,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.440]   it's 140 characters, but it feels like the, like networks like Twitter and Facebook are
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.560]   more about sort of public performance.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.960]   Whereas the networks where I share with my friends and, and interact and sort of, you
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:23.880]   know, and, and learn and grow are more, are semi, semi public, not totally public.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.600]   Google at least is responding.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:32.200]   They've say we've, a Google spokesperson, this is in the face of an attorney who sent
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.000]   a letter threatening a hundred million dollar lawsuit to Google.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.520]   Does he really represent the stars?
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.720]   We don't know who he represents.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.480]   It may not represent anybody, maybe an ambulance chaser, but a Google spokesperson responded
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   saying we've removed tens of thousands of pictures within hours of the requests being
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   made.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.800]   We have closed hundreds of accounts.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.520]   The internet is used for many good things.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.960]   Stealing people's private photos is not one of them.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.120]   Typically, they'll wait until they receive a copyright notice.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   In this case, because it's a violation of community guidelines with respect to nudity
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:10.000]   and privacy, we're turning this around in days, in hours, not weeks.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.880]   And wouldn't it be nice if everyone got the same treatment that Jennifer Lawrence gets?
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.160]   Well, that's, you know, that's another point somebody made after Robin Williams passed away
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.600]   and his daughter was getting horribly harassed.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.480]   Then Twitter took action.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   Right.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.640]   But, because it's a PR issue for the company.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   Right.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.800]   It's a black mark.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.280]   But when normal people complain now.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.560]   And the other thing I came away with was boy, a huge amount of respect for any woman who
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.000]   tears to raise her voice in public these days.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Yes.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.440]   And I just, it makes me so sad.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.880]   You know, you could talk about STEM education and all of that, but it has to start in the
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   public spaces and it has to be safe.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.480]   It does, it's responsibility of all of us and to defend someone.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:03.640]   You know, if you're in an office place and you see someone sexually harass a woman and
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.840]   you sit back and don't do anything, you're complicit.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   Yep.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   Right.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   And it's just like that.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.920]   In virtual space.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   Just like that.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.160]   And, you know, there's a discussion in the chat room about, well, what about the right
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   to be forgotten in Jarvis?
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.400]   I was thinking about this today.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:25.800]   And my argument, I spoke to a bunch of Germans last night about their problems, as far as
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.880]   I was concerned, and talked about the right to be forgotten.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.520]   And you know, my general argument is that there are already laws in place and we don't
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.800]   need laws written to technologies and changing the technology.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   And that Jennifer Lawrence's photos were stolen and violated the rules of Google and Google
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   takes it down.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.520]   The difference with the right to be forgotten is just someone coming along and saying, well,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.240]   for whatever reason, I didn't like this.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.960]   And there isn't a principle at work except I didn't like it.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:01.040]   Now, would it be nice if, you know, we've stuff could be erased all across the net?
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.960]   You can argue yes, but you're never going to succeed at that.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.320]   It's a whack-a-mole game that's never going to end.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.800]   No, no erasure and no technology is going to solve that problem.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.360]   And there are free speech issues.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.920]   We in America let the Nazis march in the Skokie because we know that most people are smart
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.840]   enough to realize that they are the idiots.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.360]   The problem with the net today, I think, in your point is we're not acting like the idiots
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   or idiots.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.360]   We're celebrating the idiots.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:38.520]   Somebody's pointing out, and this happened before in a very small way, in CB radio.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   Remember CBs?
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.320]   Break or Break or One Line?
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   It's still around.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.520]   It's been rebranded as a family radio service.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.760]   But if you go into those CB channels, it's horrific.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   It's awful.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   And it got all--
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   Why did that happen to the ham radio?
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:59.040]   Because you had to get a license because you had to pass a test and to get a license.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.320]   And by the way, maybe even more importantly, and I'll ask the hams because our ham nation
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   shows tonight and they're coming into studio.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:11.160]   But I think even more importantly, there's a very strong culture in ham radio following
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.840]   the rules and doing the right thing.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.080]   And this is OK, and this is not OK.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:23.680]   It's a culture that is perpetuated by the elders in the ham community and passed along.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.240]   OK, but stay on that for a second, Leo.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.600]   You can still have somebody who needs their meds, somebody who's psychopathic.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   They can pass the test.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   They're smart.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.600]   They can get a license and they can go on ham.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.840]   And they'll be very quickly shunned by the ham community.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.320]   OK, we're going to talk about that.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   What does that mean?
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.960]   Why did that happen in ham?
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   Why not here?
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.280]   Well, why aren't the grand elders blogging and tweeting behaving rather than saying, "Ah,
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   fight, fight."
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   Well, good.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.920]   That's what we need to do.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.840]   You know, I don't know why, but that's what we need to do.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.920]   I think partly because hams, there's something about hams.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:00.400]   The people who are attracted to ham radio are often very public minded.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.000]   It's a culture that's fascinating.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.720]   I've always been fascinated.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:09.320]   There were people who wanted to connect with people in that in the essence of the net,
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   and they were like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the net."
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   But no one had to take a test to get on the internet.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   No.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   Right.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   Or on CB radio.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   Right.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   Right.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   Anybody can do this.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.320]   And CB is useless now, by the way.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   It's dead to anybody except the trolls.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.280]   This is what happens with these guys is if you don't do something about it, if you don't
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.160]   weed your garden, then all you have left is weeds.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   All the flowers die.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.720]   Well, that's Kathy's point about, and I had learned that lesson when I ran news sites
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.600]   and I thought, "Oh, people comment, let them comment, let it go, let it go, let it go."
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.640]   No, that's the broken glass problem.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:46.720]   You do that long enough, and people will just realize, "Oh, I can do anything here."
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   Right.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Yeah, they're actually clean up New York by getting rid of the squeegee men.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   Right.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   And other minor crimes like broken glass.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   Well, that's the scene you're looking for tonight.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.280]   On 49th Street, the squeegee men tried to drag me out of my car and put my wife into premature
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   labor.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   Geez.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.840]   It was not some minor.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:12.720]   These were scum bucket people who were there, "Oh, they're just screaming in your window."
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.440]   If you didn't pay them, they tried to go after you.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.440]   Wow.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:24.840]   Well, New York went through real renaissance after this small policing effort, putting
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.280]   more cops on the street and not ignoring minor crimes.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:38.080]   But maybe that's what we need to do on the internet.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.440]   That's kind of a different thing, though, isn't it?
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   Right?
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   I mean, there's no government, there's no police force.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.800]   No, but we can do it.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.880]   We keep our neighborhood up.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.040]   We keep our neighborhood up.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.800]   We do this in our chatroom, by the way, because we learn very quickly.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.680]   If you don't immediately ban people who are even just taking the subject off topic, the
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.640]   thing disintegrates.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.440]   Most IRC is like that.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.960]   If you go into normal IRC, chairman's like, "Ah, but we got thank goodness 12 or 13 or
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.000]   15 or 20 great moderators, all volunteers who keep it on point."
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   That makes a big difference.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.840]   People often bridal, they say, "Well, free speech.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   I should be able to get to do whatever I want."
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   No.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.400]   Not your living room.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   No.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   No.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.000]   We have a goal for our chat.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   We want it to be on topic and to the point and no ad hominem attacks and that kind of
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   thing.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.720]   We need to do that in general.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   We need to do that in general.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:38.800]   Look also what happened with the society in Hong Kong, of the young people there.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.600]   They knew what would have come down upon them if they went over certain lines.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.200]   They self-enforced their own lines.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.360]   We're here to make our point not to do, we're here to do this and not this.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.120]   It was an incredible community starter.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.160]   People sharing things and benefiting each other and using technology and mesh networks
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.240]   and phenomenal efforts.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.560]   We are a society on the net.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.480]   The net is the whole world, so it's all the good and all the bad of society.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.960]   We have to set our own rules here.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:12.480]   We have to encourage the good and ignore or discourage the bad or discourage those who
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.960]   would encourage the bad.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:20.240]   Meanwhile, federal agents are fake setting up fake Facebook pages in real people's names
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.680]   using real people's pictures from their real people's phones.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.840]   This is this one.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.800]   I guess my imposter is a federal agent of that.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.000]   This blows me away.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.800]   A DEA agent commandeered a woman's identity.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:39.280]   She was arrested but never convicted of a crime.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   They got her phone.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   They took pictures off her phone.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   They put them on the fake, some fairly sexy pictures on the fake Facebook account.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   With her child.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.320]   With pictures of her kids.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:02.160]   She was apparently sentenced to probation, so she was convicted, but she pled guilty.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.760]   While she was awaiting trial, the DEA used this stuff that they had garnered in the
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.720]   investigation to create a Facebook page.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.640]   They've friended felons.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:17.280]   It was a honey pit, honey pot.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.720]   The woman now, 28 sued, accusing him in federal district court in New York of violating her
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.800]   privacy and placing her in danger.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:31.320]   The government says, "Hey, when she was arrested, she gave express permission for the use of
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:38.440]   photographs contained on her phone simply by granting access to the phone and consenting
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.320]   to the use of that information to aid in an ongoing criminal investigation."
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.560]   Whether she actually knew that they were going to make a Facebook page in dispute, we'll
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   see what she did not.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.360]   I don't think that's why she fought.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.720]   They don't think that she imagined that was going to happen.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.600]   Yeah, or pictures of her kids.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.840]   Can we just all agree to leave the kids out of it?
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.320]   Can we just leave the kids out of it?
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.000]   I kind of feel like say whatever you want about me, Photoshop, me, to your heart's content.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.640]   Just keep my kid out of it.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.800]   And that was one of the things Sierra complained about is that her family was dragged into
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   it.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:18.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.720]   We got to find something fun.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   Sorry, that was depressing.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.240]   I didn't mean to give you a downer.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.280]   You, I'm the one who brought it up.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   The whole thing.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.640]   Oh, I'm glad you did.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.440]   No, when I read that, I thought we were talking about that today.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   I'm glad.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:40.920]   I do want to talk a little bit about what you can tell about you from your Facebook likes
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   quite a bit.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.240]   And we've got our change log coming up.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   Yay.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.120]   But before we do, how about I tell you a little bit about making the best darn website you
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.240]   can make.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.760]   One of the ways actually, one of the ways you can make the internet a better place is
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:03.680]   by creating your own content on the internet, your positive content, putting out your contribution,
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.240]   telling a little bit from your point of view.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:11.160]   That means having your own website and Squarespace makes it so easy, a better website for all.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.040]   They've updated their technology now.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   I don't know.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.440]   Are they calling it Squarespace 7?
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.200]   They've, I'll tell you, they've got engineers working all the time to create that.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.360]   So it's the best hosting plus the best software.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.240]   Yeah, they're calling it Squarespace 7 to allow you.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.640]   And this is the beauty part.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.440]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.440]   You get the benefit of this.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:39.560]   There are sites always are, you know, state of the art stuff, mobile responsive design.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.400]   You've got e-commerce on every template.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.800]   Really good e-commerce too.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.920]   Really well done e-commerce.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.600]   Of course live chat and email 24/7 right from their offices in New York.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.440]   So you know, you're getting the best possible support.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:58.240]   There is a great help site with webinars and videos and self help articles.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.680]   I'm just a big fan of Squarespace.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.120]   So a couple of things.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.240]   First of all, if you want to try it out, just go to squarespace.com.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.880]   Click the get started button.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.800]   You can play with it to your heart's content for three, a couple of weeks, two weeks.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.120]   And there's no credit card required to do that.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.960]   You know, if you're done, when you're done, you just leave and that's it.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.200]   They won't contact you.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:24.640]   However, if you do decide to buy, make sure you use the offer code TWIG to get 10% off
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.840]   and show your support for this week in Google Squarespace.com.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   Try the new Squarespace 7.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.040]   I think you'll like it.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.800]   And as a special promotion for our show and for you, our audience, Squarespace is giving
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:43.680]   away a full year of its top premium level services worth more than $288 to one of you
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.720]   randomly selected.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.160]   All you have to do is tweet, "Ready?
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.200]   Better websites for all."
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:56.720]   And use the hashtag SquarespaceTwig at this week in Google to be considered.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.440]   If you currently have a Squarespace site, post your URL as well.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.080]   We might talk about you in a future episode.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.040]   It's got a tweet from somebody who won a year's worth of premium service from Squarespace
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.960]   and is very, very happy.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.280]   We use it for our inside Twit blog.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:18.480]   Squarespace.com, try it free, tweet, better websites for all with the hashtag SquarespaceTwig
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.960]   at this week in Google and we'll have a drawing of all the people who tweet and maybe you'll
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.720]   be our winner.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:32.960]   Details and information, rules for the contest are at our website, which is a Squarespace
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   site.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.440]   There are ones now inside Twit.tv, inside.twit.tv, Squarespace.com, bang the drum slowly, it's
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:52.680]   time ladies and gentlemen for the Google change log.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.040]   And now ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:03.640]   Well, I've run out of things to complain about regarding Google Voice because the one thing
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.440]   that I've always complained about, I think that all of us complain about the one thing
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.280]   this would be a perfect product if is getting resolved.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:20.200]   Google Voice is finally supporting MMS, multimedia messages, baby photos in Google Voice across
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.280]   100 different North American carriers.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   There's a butt.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.160]   Google's been working with the ton of carriers, including ancient T sprint, people.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.760]   And as Jeff would say, a really big butt.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   There's a big red check mark size.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.520]   Oh, the B is a butt.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   It's a butt.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.520]   It doesn't work with Verizon.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   Oh!
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   Wow!
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:48.640]   A hundred carriers except Verizon, which is a big except, unfortunately.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.160]   But you know, so you'll get many MMS messages, not all of them, which is an improvement.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   I mean, before you got none.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.400]   Well, good.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.160]   You won't go over your bandwidth limits on Verizon.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.320]   It is with Verizon.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   It's with them.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   All right.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   Go ahead.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.080]   I'm going to save that rant for Jeff.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   But we want to feed, we want to feed the fire a little bit more.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   De-mobile.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   De-mobile.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.200]   A little update to Google Play, especially movies.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.560]   You can now pre-order movies on Google Play.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.000]   So this feature is only going to be available in the US, and although other countries will
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.040]   be added soon, Google says.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.280]   It means that if you see a title that's going to come out on Google Play, you can pre-order
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.920]   it and you don't get charged until it gets released and you get an email letting you
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.280]   know that letting you know that the movie then is in your library.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.560]   So they're going to be shooting to offer things to pre-order that are in theaters now.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560]   So this should help us think of some--
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560]   You know what I want next, Gina?
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560]   What?
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.400]   Here's what I want next.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.480]   When there are some obscures-- because I live way out of the suburbs.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.720]   When there are some obscure foreign movie that I'm interested in that I'm never going
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   to go in Manhattan to watch because I've even had to come home.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720]   Right.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.400]   And if it's not going to be out on video for nine months, I want to bookmark that in Google
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.840]   Play.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.880]   So when it comes out, it says, "Hello, Bozo.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   It's here.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.560]   We are a stupid, boring, foreign movie."
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.320]   And then, you know, that's actually useful.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.000]   So next step, Google.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   We're never--
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.800]   Yeah, I mean, my tastes are much less intellectual than yours.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.160]   But there'll be times when I'll be like, you know, what's the next Hunger Games movie?
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.800]   Just do a Google search for the next Hunger Games movie.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.160]   And there'll sometimes be that "remind me."
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.760]   Buttons all say, "Okay, yeah, remind me."
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.120]   They always come out in like November.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.160]   And then it's exciting because whatever the week in November, it gets released.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   It'll let you know.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.480]   I don't know if that will work with the not huge blockbuster movies, though.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.440]   I don't know if it'll work for you indie foreign films.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.560]   But that should work for every movie, honestly.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   Let's see.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   What else do we have?
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.000]   Oh, so Google now can now surface your past and upcoming bills from your Gmail account.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Google Play--
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   That's going to drive people--
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   What?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   They know my bills?
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.440]   How could they possibly--
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:14.240]   The Google app for Android and iOS now has access to your Gmail account because you gave
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.800]   it access to your Gmail account.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.000]   If you get email with a paid-in-do and an amount of information about a bill--
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   That's creepy.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.680]   You'll get a card in Google now letting you know.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   I need help.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   I love this.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.680]   I automate everything.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.600]   But every once in a while, there's that month where something happens and I just don't
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.240]   have enough money, so I'll take it.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.880]   I'll take whatever reminders I can get.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.800]   The next step is to pay my bills, Google.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   Just do it.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.520]   Just pay it.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   Move the money.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520]   Do what you got to do.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   Do whatever it takes.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.160]   I had a thousand great reasons to get married, but number one was my wife, and it was my
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.760]   children's dog, because it was awful at him.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.600]   You got yourself a CEO as a girlfriend.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   Hi.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   Let me tell you.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.600]   Nothing like it.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.800]   Everybody should have somebody who understands money in their life.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.760]   Who does the latest stuff in your house, do you know?
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.920]   I actually really enjoy the first of the finance stuff.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.760]   I thought you'd be the one.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760]   Yeah, me too.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   I enjoy organizing those things.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   You should do a risk, I think.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.160]   I'm not as good at it as Lisa, so good job, Leo.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.040]   Well, anybody's better than me.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.960]   Have you ever had your water or your electricity turned off because you forgot to pay?
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   No.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   No.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   Okay.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   Okay.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   Yes.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   You did.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   Oh, many times.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   You had plenty of money.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.480]   Oh, it's not going to have the money.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   I forgot to pay.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   Was it for months?
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   For months.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.240]   For God, or you said, oh, I'll do it tomorrow.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.400]   I just don't know.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   I don't know.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.520]   Who's thinking about your water bill until you don't have water?
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520]   That's it.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.960]   They get your attention when the water stops.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.320]   And then you have to go down and say, I'm sorry, here's the money here.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.160]   Please turn my water on.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.920]   Well, send a guy out on Monday, but it's Friday.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:05.280]   That's when they work.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.280]   I do.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   I pretty much automate everything, but everyone's in a while.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.400]   I get like, oh, I have to transfer some money.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.920]   I'm using a service called Pay Trust.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.160]   I don't know if there's still, well, I know there's still a rank because I still pay them
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.200]   10 bucks a month for nothing.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.840]   But they used to, when they were in Sioux City or Sioux Falls, Idaho, and I thought, why
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   are they there?
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.440]   And then I realized because there's a big prison there.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.960]   And all my bills were going to this prison and being entered by prisoners.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960]   Oh, geez.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.280]   Oh, my.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.680]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.080]   What could go wrong?
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.240]   Anyway, so reminders about your bills.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.880]   So the Leo's water never gets turned off.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   Thank you, Google.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.840]   You don't have a Lisa.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.240]   At least you've got a Google.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   Yeah, if you don't have Lisa, you have Google now.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   I don't know.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.280]   Google now will never be as good as Lisa, but we're getting there.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.880]   No, she's amazing.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.720]   Never misses a bill.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.560]   A little update to Chrome cast.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   I know.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.400]   I think Jeff was kind of making fun of this a little bit last time.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.320]   I think we talked about this a while ago, that it was on its way.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.400]   You can basically set the images that your Chrome cast shows, kind of like a screen
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.600]   saver or a slide show.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.240]   Well, it already shows gorgeous pictures.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   What it does.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.760]   It shows some gorgeous pictures, but now you can customize them to be your own photos,
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.880]   your own photo albums from Google+, or you can choose artwork from galleries and museums
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.440]   via the Google Cultural Institute.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.520]   You can choose news and lifestyle images from the New York Times, the Guardian, and the
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.520]   US.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.360]   I like this one, satellite imagery is from the hardest to reach places on Earth from Google
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.360]   maps.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.560]   I like a good maps slide show.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:49.360]   In order to do that in your Chrome cast app, open the Chrome cast app on your phone or tablet
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:55.120]   and select backdrop from the left menu, and then you can choose what images you want to
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.120]   see.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.520]   Jeff, I see you just added something to the change time here.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.200]   I just added something because I don't understand something.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.840]   Maybe on Twitter, who was it here, the nice person on Twitter, Blankenship, I think it
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.200]   was, Brian Blankenship, said there was an update to Chromebook update, makes it easy
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.480]   to juggle multiple accounts.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.800]   And Brian said, "Will let Jeff Jarvis be the judge of its easy functionality?"
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.640]   But they've always been able to do that.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640]   I don't understand.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.080]   I don't know what this is new about this.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.640]   When you first turn on your Chromebook, it shows you the...
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   Well, that's not easy.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.080]   You should be able to go back and forth with anyone account with them.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.720]   Oh, maybe that's what they can do.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.480]   I just log into my account or there's a guest account or you can have other accounts.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.320]   I horned my way into the change log here.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.800]   Boom, glad you did.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.640]   I had some Chromebook features.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.200]   What is the ASAML standard?
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.480]   Do you have any idea?
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   As mobile.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.960]   The enhanced identity features primarily focused on enabling the SAML standard used by common
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   enterprise.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   Oh, that's why I don't know what it is.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   It's enterprise.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   Enterprise authorization providers.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.200]   So it sounds like this is a way for you to switch between your personal account and
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   your organization's...
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:05.120]   Your Google for work account easily using that enterprise standard.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.960]   I actually don't know what ASAML is.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   Something...
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   So I'm something...
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   Security authorization markup language.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   There you go.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.480]   Oh, of course it's a markup language.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480]   It's a normal.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   It's a normal.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.920]   A security assertion markup language.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.520]   All those users to bring their own Chromebooks to the office.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.480]   I bet you it means you could authenticate with something.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   If you click on the bottom of that...
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   There's a link to the Google...
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480]   Single sign-ons.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480]   ...on solution.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480]   Right, right.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   All right.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.280]   More manageable for IT.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   Okay.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.920]   So they want to bring Chromebooks into the enterprise that's already using...
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   It's enterprise.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   Google sign-on.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   All right.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   Never mind.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   Never mind.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   All right.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   All right.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   That's all I got.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.960]   That is the Google change log.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.840]   Thank you, Gina Trippani.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.880]   So how much does Facebook really know about you?
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.200]   A study by researchers at the University of Cambridge gathered data from 60,000 Facebook
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.440]   users and with their likes alone predicted a variety of personal traits including gender,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.200]   religion, sexual orientation, and substance abuse.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:30.120]   So I thought I'd try to see the article in Slate talking about this explains something
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:30.960]   kind of weird.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.280]   If you like curly fries, you're likely to be intelligent.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.080]   Now that seems counterintuitive since those things will kill you.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.760]   But it turns out that people swim in packs.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.640]   And so at some point somebody who was really smart did a like on curly fries and they're
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.840]   equivalently smart friends because smart people seem to like each other were influenced by
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   that.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.680]   They liked curly fries and this is an actual signal and eventually enough smart people
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   liked curly fries that it seems more likely that if you like curly fries you'll be smart.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   Huh?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.760]   Well, I would say Facebook doesn't know about me.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.000]   Well, let me see because I ran the program.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.840]   This is they have two versions of this.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.360]   There's one called you are what you like.com and there's one called apply magic sauce
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360]   dot com.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.840]   They're both from Cambridge.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.480]   Apply magic softs gives you a Jason feed of your traits, but which you can parse, you
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.720]   know, in your brain.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.960]   But this one, this one is a little bit easier.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.840]   So apparently I am conservative and traditional, not liberal and artistic.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.000]   Same here.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.400]   That seems wrong to me.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   It's way wrong.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.360]   And it says by the way that I am because one of my conservative, traditional friends
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   is Chris Hughes.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.520]   Well, I made the mistake of befriending some Republicans.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.680]   There's my my problem right there.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.880]   By the way, Alex Gumpel, you're my most liberal and artistic friend as is Will Harris.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.680]   How about that, huh?
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.640]   You're very you're very liberal and artistic.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.000]   Did you know that Alex?
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.160]   Based on your likes.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.840]   I am well organized.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.800]   Apparently Facebook is not know about those bills.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.200]   I'm just arguing against that.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.800]   And when you think we can't even do our bills, I am not spontaneous and flexible.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   I am shy and reserved.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.960]   But you notice these aren't overwhelming percentages when we're the other.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.840]   So it's it's not a strong signal, right?
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.440]   And also how I use Facebook may not reflect my real personality.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.520]   I am a certain of the same.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.800]   Gina, don't go do this.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.160]   You're going to be the same.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.240]   We're all the same because we would be because we're in a cohort.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.520]   Yeah, it's a radical.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.040]   I am calm and relaxed as opposed to emotional.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.680]   I'm not really.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.680]   What a shock.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.960]   My most common relaxed friends are Kevin Rose and Steve Wozniak.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:56.040]   It's just so right here.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.960]   Personality twins Jeff Jarvis, you showed up.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   Nice.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.160]   And David Pogue, I think.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.080]   Jeff Jarvis, David Pogue, Carly Perkins, who works for us.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.280]   Martin Sargent from Tech TV and Jenny Moyer, who's a friend.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.080]   And then my opposite Alex Gumpel will look at him.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.720]   Dan Farber of Cnet, Kevin Rose.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.400]   He's my opposite.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.280]   So this is very interesting.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   My one click.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.880]   I don't find this very accurate.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.280]   Who is your Randy Zuckerberg?
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.480]   Is your is your is who you are?
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.880]   My personality twin.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.880]   Huh?
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.120]   I don't use Facebook so much, but I really liked analyze words.com.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.200]   Which looks at Twitter.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   See you do.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.800]   Well, in fact, I saw you and or somebody and Neil talking about whether you're analytics
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.040]   or not at thinking.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   Uh huh.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   So what's the analyze words?
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.560]   Yeah, analyze words.com.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.320]   You pop in your Twitter handle and it tells you, it kind of gives you, it does a personality
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   analysis.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.320]   So it says that.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.120]   Stuff is very close to astrology, I think.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.440]   Well, it says that I'm very upbeat.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.840]   I'm very worried and I'm a little bit angry and not so depressed.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:21.160]   Well on on Twitter, I'm extremely angry and extremely upbeat.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.120]   I'm highly plugged in, highly personable.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.680]   I am only an average spacey valley girl.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.200]   I think I got high on spacey valley girl.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.640]   I think this is so boat.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.000]   And apparently my thinking style is very high for analytic.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.920]   That's the strongest signal.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   And look at all the tweets that's analyzed.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.280]   Huh.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.960]   Then you can analyze a friend and compare yourself.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.120]   I don't know.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.960]   I plugged in.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.880]   But you are.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.920]   Let me compare myself to InfoSec Taylor Swift.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.680]   She's very angry.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.160]   We were having this discussion about whether or not think of as analytics.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.480]   I mean, certainly it is.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.240]   But we were talking more about how that really turns off.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.840]   Because it's a consumer product, but it's called analytics.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.400]   There's some dissonance there, right?
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.520]   Because John Gruber actually said, when you say social analytics,
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.680]   I hear tool for debags.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.720]   Which I think is like one step above SEO.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:28.840]   All right.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.040]   And he compared it to SEO.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.640]   Exactly.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.360]   He said that there's plenty of good worthwhile SEO,
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.760]   but the word has become so sullied at this point.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.120]   And that's happened to analytics.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.760]   And we've had a really hard time explaining what ThinkUp is.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.120]   It's like, no, it's not an analytics dashboard
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.840]   that a brand with a CMO is going to use.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.080]   It's for regular people.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.840]   But regular people aren't asking for looking for or relate to analytics.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.000]   So yeah, we changed our tagline to daily insights about you and your friends.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.880]   Insights are better.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.520]   I think so.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.880]   It isn't exactly analytics because it's not analytical in that sense.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.600]   I mean, you don't get a graph or anything.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.760]   It's just like little insights, little nuggets.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.200]   I have more followers than 89% of the people I follow.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.840]   That's kind of an-- that's a new one.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.000]   You just added that one.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:18.680]   That is a new one.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.760]   So 2,000 of your friends would reach a bigger audience if I retweeted them.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:32.840]   And for some reason, I would probably do that guy a lot.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.560]   I don't even know who he is.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.200]   Probably a troll.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.400]   And here's the--
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]   What was your percentage, Leo?
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.360]   Huh?
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.400]   What was your percentage?
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.360]   89%.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.960]   I have more followers than 89% of the people I follow.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.000]   84%.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.600]   That makes sense.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.000]   Yeah, that's our-- that's our-- you know, with great power.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.160]   Comes great responsibility.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.560]   My most popular tweet four years ago, one word.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.240]   Imagine.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   [LAUGHS]
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.240]   Huh?
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.520]   That must have been--
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.120]   Was probably the 20th anniversary of John Lennon's killing.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:09.800]   That must have been.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.120]   I would guess.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.000]   That must have been it.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.200]   Or 30th.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.560]   Yeah, it would have been 30th.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.920]   Holy cow.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560]   Wow.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.360]   Anyway.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.360]   Anyway.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:24.880]   Anyway.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.400]   I just-- from Gina that I'm ready for Hillary is following me.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.560]   I'm ready for Hillary right on.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.000]   I am.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.520]   Is that Sir Edmund Hillary Conqueror of Everest?
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:42.800]   I think Craig Newmark wrote a great post yesterday.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.240]   Yes.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.120]   And my favorite line was not the John Locke on Lost.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.200]   [LAUGHS]
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.120]   Not that John Locke.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.520]   It was just--
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.720]   I like it.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.080]   So more news from the-- more bizarre news from the HTC
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.960]   announcement, they have announced a new camera called the HTC
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.760]   Rei.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.720]   I kid you not.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.760]   This is a little black plastic periscope, kind of a GoPro.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.000]   $199.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.600]   But they make a point of saying, if you're going to climb them
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.040]   out and you use the GoPro, this is just for you, debishes.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:18.760]   We don't get it.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.560]   If you don't ride crazy bicycles off--
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.320]   it's a strange form factor.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.480]   They're--
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.440]   What do you do with that?
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.400]   You tap the button on the back to take a still.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.440]   You long press it to record a video on 1080p.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.080]   Or you front press the button on the device to record it
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:34.760]   slow-mo.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.840]   So it's a very simple UI.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.680]   There's no viewfinder.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.480]   I don't know how you then get--
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.080]   oh, the camera can automatically back up to Google Drive
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:53.000]   Dropbox or your phone when you're connected to Wi-Fi.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.840]   The camera connects to Wi-Fi or the camera?
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.800]   You know, you see--
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.320]   this is an internet of things play.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:01.040]   You're going to see more and more of this stuff where this stuff
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.120]   sits on a network.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.240]   And then the intelligence is not in the camera.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.040]   It's in the phone.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.440]   And then they're both on the same network.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.040]   And then the phone goes, oh, I see my re.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.480]   And let me send the pictures to Dropbox or whatever.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.840]   I still contend you're going to end up
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.880]   wearing your computer.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.480]   It's going to be that big.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.000]   And it's going to-- you're going to have one computer
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:22.760]   with a great battery.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.320]   And it's going to talk to peripherals.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.000]   And everything else in life becomes a peripheral.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.120]   I want to replace my spleen with a computer.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   Can I do that?
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.400]   Who needs a spleen anyway?
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.200]   You don't need the spleen.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.040]   It's just kind of--
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.640]   Why do I have to vent it all the time, then?
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.160]   You're venting your spleen again.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.040]   I don't know what that means.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:43.720]   I don't want to ask.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.680]   No, don't.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.240]   It's not.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.680]   It's--
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.600]   Well, it's OK, Gina.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.120]   It's OK.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:48.720]   It's OK.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.240]   It's OK.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.400]   You ever heard that phrase?
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   It's OK.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:51.840]   It's OK.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.400]   He's venting his spleen.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.400]   Which means you're--
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.120]   Oh, OK.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:55.920]   It's a phrase.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.440]   OK.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.120]   It's ranting.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.640]   I was worried that it was a Jeff medical procedure.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.160]   I was a chair.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.640]   It's not one of those prostate moments.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.320]   Don't worry.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.200]   OK, OK.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.840]   But now that you've raised that, we could go down there,
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.360]   but we won't.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.240]   Yes, vent your spleen.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.280]   Google tells me.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.280]   So--
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.400]   Figurative.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   James Fry.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.360]   Or is it Frey?
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.560]   How do you pronounce his name?
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.600]   I think it's Frey.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.080]   Fryer Frey.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.200]   Spell Frey.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.720]   I liked his novel, which was a million little pieces.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.720]   Was that what it was called?
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.320]   Yeah, he's the dude that made up a bunch of stuff.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.040]   Yeah, he got-- it was a really good--
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   no, I-- well, it was a million--
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:43.120]   it was supposed to be a memoir, but it really was just a novel.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.080]   And so for some reason, I don't really understand
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.320]   he got in trouble for that.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.040]   Well, because he-- Oprah loved him,
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.160]   and he came on Oprah, and then he had to go back on Oprah
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.320]   and get beat up by Oprah because he lied to Oprah.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.760]   It didn't-- but you know what?
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   It was a really good novel.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.880]   He went with the marketing part around it being a memoir.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.680]   He didn't direct everybody.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.400]   I guess he's rehabilitated now because Google's
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.760]   working with him on a project which will combine--
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.680]   this is all-- what do they call it?
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.480]   Transmedia.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.440]   It combines interactive novels with augmented reality games.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.880]   This is the next step for ingress.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.040]   By the way, we have a bunch of ingress devotees around here.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.960]   How many miles have you walked Jeff on ingress?
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.360]   Like he said, he said, I've lost 173 pounds or something.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.200]   Wow.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.080]   It's always in kilometers, so he never knows.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.200]   We don't know what's kilometers.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.280]   How many kilometers?
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.880]   He's done 91 kilometers in the last couple of weeks,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.640]   playing that stupid game where you try to take over post offices
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:51.600]   and I-hops.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.720]   Anyway, so the next thing is going to be end game,
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:00.520]   the calling, augmented reality interactive game.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.720]   The idea is to build a whole world around these novels.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.360]   So they're going to have puzzles, but I guess they'll
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   be in the real world.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.280]   The video right there, she is not a good actress.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.080]   OK, let's see.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.200]   Dad was right.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.000]   She's acting right now.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.560]   Oh boy.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.640]   I didn't want to believe him, but he was right.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.080]   The world has been mutating.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.280]   The last 10,000 years, the world has been mutating.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.840]   Is it the actor or is it the script, really?
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.320]   Unrecognizable.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:36.840]   It's broken.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   It's broken.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.360]   It's broken.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   It's broken.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   It's broken.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.280]   He was always telling me.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.480]   OK, I can't watch anymore.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.680]   What is going to happen?
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.880]   She's really unflosser.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:46.320]   She's bad.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.920]   I'm sure she's a very nice person.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   I'm sure she's very nice, and she's about as lucky
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.160]   as the runway models on the--
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.720]   What she's doing is hard, though.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.640]   I mean, she's just--
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.000]   It's hard.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.600]   I agree.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.880]   It's a terrible script, and she's
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.200]   trying to make it real in a camera.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.680]   And there's like five Google guys looking at her.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.280]   So it's hard.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:10.760]   It's hard.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:16.880]   She needs a James Cameron to come in there and work with her.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.000]   It's hard to say that the world is
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.280]   better morphosizing than--
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]   I wouldn't want to be in that.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.800]   I would be just as bad as that.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.040]   So they have a site like this.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Niantic Labs.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.840]   Do anything when you buy the book.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.080]   When you buy the book, it's very unclear to me
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.400]   what actually happens here and what you get.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.680]   Now, this is at Niantic Project.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.400]   There's something called the Jarvis Resurrection.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:41.880]   What?
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.680]   What?
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.320]   Let's click on this and see.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.040]   Parting words number five.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:52.920]   Let me see some dead.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.040]   Thank you very much.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.320]   The Jarvis virus.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.720]   What the hell is that?
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.200]   It turns all the blue ones green.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.400]   It turns all the blue ones green.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.960]   It's very rare.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.760]   Wow.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.320]   You are a very-- oh, wait a minute.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.240]   Bring it back.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.760]   Bring back the Jarvis virus.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.520]   There it is.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.520]   The Google guys, there's something with the word
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.680]   the name Jarvis, don't they?
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.640]   You do one that's not me.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.520]   It's because of Iron Man?
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:19.840]   It's cool.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.120]   Yeah, it's Iron Man, right?
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.080]   It's Iron Man.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.440]   Oh, just that's nothing.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.840]   OK, she's still talking, but now she's stopped.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.520]   And now it's ancient societies.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.880]   I don't know what it means.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.800]   The world is-- the world is--
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.240]   it's mutated.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.200]   It's mutating.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.320]   Dad was right.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.220]   Dad was--
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.720]   [SINGING]
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.240]   Anything else?
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.840]   I was an unlikeable person.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.520]   Have you read Mr. Schmidt's new book?
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.680]   I started it.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.520]   And I went to speak at Google and all I got was one book.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.440]   It was a sticking book, though.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.720]   How Google works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.920]   It's very much a management ebook.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.360]   Yeah, yeah, it's not my thing.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   That's the thing.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.240]   If they would actually say how Google works,
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.480]   I would read that.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.400]   Larry's-- go look up Larry's.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.960]   Larry's--
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.240]   pretty loot, what am I trying to say?
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.240]   Forward is good.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.560]   It's forward.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.360]   Does he actually talk about--
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.640]   I mean, is it just celebrating all the awesomeness
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.680]   that Google is?
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.600]   Or does he--
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.040]   are there any lessons learned?
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.000]   Are there any failures?
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   Were they-- you know what?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:35.800]   They came out of it?
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.000]   Or is it just about how great Google is?
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.880]   How do you get creative people?
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.680]   No, it's more presumption.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.440]   Because you want to be us, you might ask, what would we do?
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.240]   It's been done.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.000]   This is how you can do that.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.760]   This is how you hire really smart people.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.080]   This is how you do--
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.600]   Like-- like--
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.880]   There's chapters called Culture, Strategy, Talent,
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:02.880]   Decisions, Communications, Innovation.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.640]   The funny thing is the Wall Street Journal
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.280]   assigned Steven Sonofsky, the failed architect of Windows 8
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.120]   to the review.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.080]   Now we know what Sonofsky's been up to.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.360]   It's actually the shortest thing Sonofsky's ever written.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.960]   It must have had somebody really added it.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.720]   Let me go to the Larry--
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:23.800]   I've got it here.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.720]   Because they did a half-price deal if you pre-ordered it on play.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:28.840]   So I bought it.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.440]   And then I got to--
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.160]   It's not nice to remain to a book before it even comes out.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:41.880]   So if you go-- by the way, Jonathan Rosenbergs,
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.040]   or do Eric Schmidt's Google+ feed,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.800]   he has a really funny cartoon.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.640]   All right.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640]   All right.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.480]   I'm up for that.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.040]   I'm not going to do anything.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:51.760]   Here's here, Larry.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.800]   Larry says, over time, I've learned surprisingly
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.200]   that it's tremendously hard to get teams to be super ambitious.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:58.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.000]   It turns out most people haven't been educated
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.920]   in this kind of moon shot thinking.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.680]   They tend to assume that things are impossible
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.600]   rather than starting from real world physics
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.280]   and figuring out what's actually possible.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   It's why we put so much energy into hiring independent thinkers
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.080]   at Google and setting big goals.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.120]   Because if you hire the right people and have big enough dreams,
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.560]   you'll usually get there.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.760]   I'm envision this kind of grin now.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.640]   And even if you fail, you'll probably learn something important.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.840]   All right, I'm bored.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.760]   It's literally--
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   Moving along.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.520]   I would like to hire creative thinker who
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.440]   would come up with a word other than moon shot.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.320]   Can we make that happen?
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.200]   I'm tired of hearing moon shot.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.440]   Let's come with a different--
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.040]   I wanted to hire a creative thinker who can figure out
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.160]   how to do multiple accounts.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.160]   Oh, bad.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:51.880]   I yelled, but I spoke at Google last week at the work group.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.480]   And I said, I'm going to start there.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.560]   I'm going to berate you people.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.040]   I want multiple accounts to work well, and it doesn't work well.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.680]   I'm pissed.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.320]   And what was their response?
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.480]   Did they look at their shoes?
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.520]   I guess that's why they made the announcement today.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.440]   I got most of work.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.480]   Did you also see-- interesting too, I think Leo,
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.280]   similar to the end game thing is the Google doing cross media
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.160]   cross platform marketing for the movie "Interstellar."
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.160]   And this starts to show how Google+ becomes a monetizable thing.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.480]   Ah, a little bit.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.200]   So it's not an ad, but native content.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.600]   If it's "Interstellar.withGoogle.com."
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.840]   "Interstellar."
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.120]   Thought with Google.com.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.080]   There's a good--
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.120]   So this is a transmedia.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.560]   The idea of transmedia--
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.960]   Lucas is a perfect example.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.160]   As you have a world, a universe like the Star Wars universe,
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.360]   but you give people a variety of ways to get involved with it.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.480]   Not just watching the movie, not just reading a comic book
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.960]   or a novelization, but also action figures, video games,
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.040]   Lego pieces, whatever you could think of that will get
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.680]   people introduced to the world.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.000]   And then, of course, they consume the rest of it.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   So what do I do?
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.240]   Launch Space Hunt.
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   All right.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.080]   I'm going to let you do this.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:14.880]   I'm going to watch you do it.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.560]   What is it?
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.320]   Now what?
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   Here we are at Saturn.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.720]   Distance from the Earth is a lot.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.560]   If you had to walk here in Ingress,
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.720]   Star HD 11506 identified.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.040]   The universe-- oh, and now I can download this.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.680]   This is like wallpaper?
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.800]   It is.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.240]   So is this going to be a movie interstellar?
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:37.600]   Yes.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.840]   So now it's just by doing this, it's
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:43.600]   convinced me to download this crappy wallpaper.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.120]   What was this?
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.840]   Is it a wallpaper?
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:46.720]   Wallpaper.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.800]   Back to the moon.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.000]   What's this?
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.040]   That's not the moon, Leo.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.200]   Back to the Death Star.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.840]   The universe is always expanding.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.920]   Keep searching.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:02.600]   Jupiter's red spot is actually a massive high pressure storm.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.400]   It's been going on for hundreds of years.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.080]   Oh, no, not Matthew McConaughey.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.400]   I cannot abide him.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.280]   Have you seen his Cadillac commercial?
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.520]   That commercial-- no, it's not a Cadillac.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   It's a Lincoln.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:14.960]   It's not a Cadillac.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.320]   Lincoln.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:16.760]   Lincoln.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.600]   Oh, my-- see how effective it is?
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.520]   Oh, my lord.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.280]   That is a little bit of an annoying commercial.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.080]   I loved him in True Detective.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.080]   I think he's a good actor.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.160]   But he is kind of an annoying person.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.480]   I don't know what this is.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:36.280]   And this is companies every 10 years that companies come back
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.520]   to this.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.280]   We'll make this mysterious puzzle--
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.760]   You'll immerse yourself in.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.200]   You'll immerse yourselves in, and then we can sneak ads
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.400]   under your system.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.520]   I mean, remember the BMW ad that
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.520]   was at the very bottom of the page?
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.880]   And you'd say, what is this strange thing?
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.280]   And you'd click it.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.400]   This has been going on since the internet was invented.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.000]   Now I can hear the golden record.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.760]   So some of this is real content.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.920]   Oh, well, just push me to YouTube.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.400]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.520]   I wish to extend greetings and friendly wishes to--
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.840]   They've got a little more excited.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.600]   --to avoid you and receive this message.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.360]   The sounds of Earth.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.680]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.800]   It is very boring.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.200]   By the time this-- by the time Veeger exited the galaxy,
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.080]   we no longer were using vinyl records.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.840]   So we should have sent a CD.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.920]   I don't remember the committee and outer space.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.320]   And we believe, say, this committee would for Veeger.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.680]   I do French and outer space.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.840]   I ask you probably.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.080]   No, my country is situated in the west coast
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.480]   of the continent of Africa.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.880]   I don't think they know that.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.680]   I don't think they know that.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.320]   Otherwise--
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:53.600]   The continent.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.600]   What's the country?
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.160]   --continent?
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.760]   Well, Africa, what's that?
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.120]   Samsung, 60% profit drop is sales slow.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:02.920]   Yikes.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.360]   Yikes.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.240]   People are finally catching on to the crap
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.600]   that is the Galaxy phone series.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.720]   Or no.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.360]   That's mean.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.520]   I shouldn't say it that way.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.040]   But I feel that way.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.120]   Deep down.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.000]   We couldn't tell.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.400]   But that's weird.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.640]   You thought-- I mean, I thought you couldn't stop them.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.120]   They were a juggernaut.
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.640]   They spent more than $1 billion in ads last year.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.000]   We talked about it a little bit last night on all that Android.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.760]   They're getting hit by both ends, right?
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.040]   Their high end phones are available much cheaper
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.360]   from new manufacturers, the OnePlus One, for example.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.040]   And also the iPhone now that you've got a bigger iPhone,
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040]   people might be switching.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.520]   But this happened to that?
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.000]   Oh, well, no, this is a huge--
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.880]   this is a prognostication.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.120]   It hasn't happened yet.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.920]   Hasn't happened yet.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.960]   Ah, OK.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.960]   It is going to happen.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.680]   But it is.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.480]   It's an issue of they're not selling phones.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.680]   They're just not selling phones.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.680]   Right.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.480]   Which is amazing, given the amount of marketing
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.680]   and advertising they do.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.800]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.000]   When we come back, are you ready for a tip?
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.080]   On the number, I have a tool.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.880]   Our show today brought to you by GoToMeeting from Citrix.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.840]   Oh, we love Citrix GoToMeeting, the proven solution
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:25.080]   for meeting and collaborating online.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.680]   Right now, if you sign up for GoToMeeting,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.920]   you'll get another Citrix product free for six months
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.760]   communicating and business so important.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.920]   It's how we solve problems, how we get things done.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.080]   When communication doesn't happen, when it breaks down,
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.680]   that's when you're in trouble.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.800]   With GoToMeeting, you're always in touch,
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.240]   even when your clients and colleagues are anywhere
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.080]   in the world all over the world.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.840]   The GoToMeeting lets you share the same screen,
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.160]   so you're literally on the same page.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.080]   And with the built-in video conferencing,
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.200]   you get crystal clear video on your webcam.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.320]   And since everybody's got a webcam,
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.880]   whether it's an iPad, an iPhone, a desktop, or a laptop,
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.040]   it really is great.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.040]   It helps your team work smarter anywhere they are.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.280]   Sign up for GoToMeeting today.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.720]   Is it GoToMeeting.com?
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.800]   Don't wait, this offer ends just a few days hence,
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.440]   October 10th.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.840]   You still can try it free, but the six months free
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.040]   of another product, only for a couple more days
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.200]   to October 10th.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.280]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:30.240]   Let's start things off with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.480]   So my tip of the week is an Android Wear app that I really
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.200]   that I really like.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.960]   And I'm actually ripping this off from Aaron Carsten
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.400]   from who was on all about Android last night.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.120]   This was his app in the arena.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.960]   It's called Wear Mini Launcher.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.040]   It's a launcher for all your Wear apps
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:52.320]   that you pull over to the side and you get a grid of icons
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.600]   in order to launch your apps.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:59.480]   So by default, on Wear, you have to go to Google
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.160]   and then slide down and then go through all these menus
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.160]   and then go to More.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.280]   And it's a bunch of swiping.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:07.840]   And this Wear Mini Launcher actually,
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.040]   just you swipe in from the left, you get a grid of icons.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.640]   You can launch whatever app that you want.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.560]   And I use the stopwatch.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.720]   I use-- I got Flopsy Droid.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.320]   Flopsy Droid, what's that?
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.040]   Yeah, which is-- it's like basically Flappy Bird,
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.480]   but for your watch.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.240]   I got Google Keep, your settings.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.880]   I've got a baby lock app, which is really what I needed.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.080]   I need to be able to launch that baby lock as quickly
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.080]   as possible.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.600]   Flock it!
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.640]   Yeah, because the Moto 360 will not
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.840]   have the same fate as the M8 had.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.120]   So yeah, I really-- I like it a lot.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.000]   If you have Android Wear, check it out.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.360]   I sort of-- and I have to say, I'm backtracking here.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.840]   I sort of mocked the Apple Watch a little bit,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.840]   because I said, oh, look at those grid of icons.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.600]   That's crazy.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.520]   That's stupid.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.960]   I got to say, this is basically a grid of icons
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.760]   of your third party apps.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.520]   But I really like it.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.080]   It's a really quick way to just launch something rather
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.600]   than have to go through the regular, the default rig
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.040]   and roll.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:09.720]   That's not a default Google app that's in a card for Google
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.040]   now.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.560]   So that's a Wear Mini Launcher.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.320]   And it is free in the Play Store.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.080]   I agree, and I use it.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:15.960]   Installed.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.760]   Just installed.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.240]   I really like it.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240]   Awesome.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240]   Cool.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.320]   Also, as long as we're talking about Wear stuff,
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.280]   Intellicom makes some watch faces,
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.960]   customizable watch faces, which I really like.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.360]   On the Moto 360, it comes with its own really pretty nice watch
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.000]   faces, including a dual face that lets you do two times.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.320]   But this is from Intellicon.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.760]   You could put the Ferrari logo or the Google logo there.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.680]   I actually have an LCD that shows the East Coast time.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.720]   I showed this earlier.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.480]   Battery life on my watch.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:48.880]   It's free.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:49.520]   It's really great.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.840]   Intellicom, I think it's called Wear faces.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.800]   But I like the fact that it's really--
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.560]   we're starting to see customizations for this.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.920]   For instance, you have to download a little program.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.040]   But normally, if you say take a note, it goes to Google Keep,
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.240]   but you can have it use Evernote.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.000]   I just feel Lyman was on the triangulation on Monday.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.200]   He told me.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.240]   It's just a little-- it's in the Play Store little Evernote
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.360]   stub that doesn't even show up as an app on your app launcher,
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.200]   but somehow modifies Evernote so that that can be the default
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.400]   note application.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.840]   I'd like to see more of those.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.160]   That's really great.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.360]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.640]   My watch, by the way, this coming happens.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.920]   Yesterday, just suddenly I realized I haven't had any
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.840]   notifications on it all day.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.280]   And I couldn't get it going.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.520]   So I had a little mute thing on.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.600]   I couldn't get it off.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.880]   So I had to rebuild the watch.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.720]   But it's too much.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.560]   You slide it.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.200]   OK, let me just show you.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.160]   Yeah, you slide down.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.360]   You slide it down.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.280]   What, it was--
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.240]   OK, so you got the watch face?
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.080]   Two things to know about with the watch face.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.840]   You already know you double tap it or just say, OK, Google.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.040]   If you press and hold--
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.520]   oops, never mind.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.080]   I wasn't talking to you for this time.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.600]   This one time, you press and hold, you could change the watch face.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   I do that.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:09.040]   And if you slide down, you can mute or unmute notifications.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.760]   Oh, never mind.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.360]   Well, how do I-- now it's not unmuting.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.520]   OK, got to tell them you're--
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.080]   Well, that's--
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:15.080]   There it is.
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.280]   I don't unmute it together.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.160]   No, OK, got it.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.840]   All right, thank you.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.200]   Never mind.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.240]   Actually, are you guys liking your Moto 360?
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.200]   Actually, when we were in London, we used it for navigation.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.240]   So you can have Google Maps.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.560]   You tell it-- you know, navigate to the Tower of London.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.160]   And then it will show you an alert.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.800]   OK, Google.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.320]   Navigate home.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.280]   It'll show you an alert as you get close to the corner
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.160]   you got to turn on.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.400]   Let me just put my home address in here.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.360]   And I'm going to navigate.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.640]   You can choose driving, bicycling.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.320]   I'll choose walking.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:00.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.040]   Navigate.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.800]   And now what it's going to do is calculate the route.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.320]   And as you're walking, your Ristel buzz
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.520]   when you's time to make a turn.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.960]   North on Taylor Street toward Washington Street.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.640]   I didn't even talk to you.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.120]   So it tells you which direction to go.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.440]   And then I think this-- you guys with glass
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.880]   have probably already familiar with this.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.280]   But I think that's really a good use for the watch.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.800]   Yeah, that's neat.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.040]   I was-- at first, I was like, wait,
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.600]   do I need to just walk like this, you know, the whole time?
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.280]   And no, you--
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.400]   No buzz to you.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.400]   Yeah, you walk the direction you're supposed to go in.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.840]   And then it buzzes you when you're supposed to turn.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.680]   That's really nice.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.640]   It was great for getting around London,
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:36.840]   where we didn't know where we were going.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.160]   It really worked well.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.080]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis?
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:43.920]   Right, right.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.320]   OK, so well, I'm going to be a boring old poof,
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.720]   talking about my favorite topic, the right to be forgotten.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:51.680]   OK.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.520]   Just a little number update here.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.600]   So far, 135,000 requests representing 470,000 URLs.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.040]   This is the new part.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.600]   Google has refused 30% of them.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.240]   About 50% have been taken down.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:07.560]   And the rest required more details.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.920]   This comes from a registered story
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.280]   talking about how some Irish people were
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.040]   complaining that Google didn't do what they wanted.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.080]   Well, there.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.560]   So there.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.760]   There.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.920]   My tool comes from Paul Therat on Windows Weekly,
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.560]   of all things.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.920]   It's a Microsoft product that is kind of cool.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.720]   Microsoft ZIMS, spelled X-I-M, a free download.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.520]   It's for Windows Phone or Android.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.080]   I put it on my Android.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.560]   And you're going to like this.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.760]   In fact, if you check your Gmail, Gina,
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.840]   you might have a ZIM invitation from me.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.200]   What it does is allows you to share pictures and control
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.880]   that share on your phone.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.080]   The other person does not need to have ZIM installed.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.040]   They just need to check the--
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.360]   I can text or email.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.840]   And I'm going to create a new ZIM.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.040]   I can get the ZIM from--
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.920]   if you show my phone, I could choose it from my camera.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.560]   There it is.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.720]   Camera roll, OneDrive, because it's a Microsoft product.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.440]   Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.200]   I'm going to choose my London slide show.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.280]   These are pictures I took in London.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.000]   Select them all.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.840]   I'm going to have them go to Gina and Paul.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.680]   And let's start it.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.560]   And now, in theory, you don't even
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.600]   have to be on the same network.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.400]   And you don't have to have ZIM installed.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.280]   You should get a text.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.920]   And it's a web-- it's web-based.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.040]   Oh, let's say I think we picked them.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:30.400]   And now it's--
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.560]   There you go.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.720]   And it's web-based.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.600]   And so you'll get a link to a website.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.200]   And then I control the slide show.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.880]   Isn't that cool?
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.600]   Very cool.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.280]   Are you getting it?
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:41.760]   Did you get it?
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.120]   I'm trying to find--
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.160]   I haven't gotten the email.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.200]   You want to come to your Gmail?
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.000]   Maybe I screwed up.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.280]   I couldn't get Paul to see it either.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   But this is nice, because you don't
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.680]   have to hand your phone around the table.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:53.920]   You can just add your friends.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.400]   If they're in your contact list, it's quite easy.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.000]   And then you can just show them your pictures.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.520]   Weird.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.840]   I didn't see the email.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:02.680]   I don't know.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.840]   Maybe it doesn't work.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.040]   It's free to try--
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.000]   I'm going to try the search panel.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.200]   Maybe I might have done the wrong address.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.520]   Oops.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.960]   Very cool, though.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.280]   XIM.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.080]   Microsoft ZIM.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.080]   All right, that's it.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.280]   We're done.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.880]   Thank you very much, lady and gentle man.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:26.920]   No, no iOS.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.280]   Sorry, folks.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.080]   Gina Trapani is at ThinkUp.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.800]   That's a great place to go, where you get your free ThinkUp trial
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.600]   account, and get insights into what you're
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.400]   sharing on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.320]   And make yourself a better sharer.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.360]   And I'm blogging again at my old--
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:43.800]   What?
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.520]   --which is new, again, scribbling.net.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:50.240]   I'm actually doing the Ohms 30 Day Blogging Challenge
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.560]   three days in.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.600]   And actually, today I got a pass, because my talk from Excel
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.680]   got released on YouTube.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.960]   So it's now on my blog.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:02.200]   So yeah, I decided smarter where I sounded too much like underwear.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.760]   You got me on that, Leo.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.480]   I said that.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.160]   This is my new site.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.360]   I'm so mean.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.680]   Oh, cool.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.840]   But this is my-- yeah, so my XOXO talk is there on my blog.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.120]   And I've got a transcript of the talk,
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.640]   if you like, to read instead of watch.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.840]   And yeah, a couple of other posts, just little things.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.560]   What's going on?
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.120]   What's scribbling.net?
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.080]   Yeah, that was my first blog ever
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.160]   that I started in 2001.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.400]   The domain was, anyway.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.440]   So going back to old new first principles.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.000]   Very cool.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.880]   You know, I didn't mention, but we had the with known people
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.040]   on.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:41.840]   And I actually set up a with known blog at leoville.net.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.720]   I really like this.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:43.560]   This is the whole idea.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.640]   This is you post on your own site.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.200]   And then it syndicates it out to Facebook or whatever.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.720]   And so I've been posting pictures and stuff there.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.200]   It's kind of like a tumble log.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.080]   But what's cool about it is when you do post something,
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.320]   you can have it go out to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.800]   And I imagine they will add more in time.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.600]   And the four square, you can even
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.680]   do check ins via open street map.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.240]   Yeah, you know, I've been seeing your posts
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.840]   around the different networks and seeing
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.840]   that they're originating from the we're with known site.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.040]   And I have to say that they're really-- they look really good.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.640]   They look very native.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.480]   They don't look like they're syndicated.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.560]   I really like how you've been--
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.720]   it looks like the software works really well.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.440]   I think so.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.600]   I mean, it's very early days.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.880]   It's an open source project.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.520]   But I said, all you need is a lamp server.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.080]   And you do have to have PHP 5.4, a fairly recent version.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.280]   That was a little stumbling block.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.040]   At first, thanks to Bear, who helped me set that up.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.280]   We were able to get that going.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.120]   And it's primitive.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.240]   It's not-- it's early days.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.000]   There's lots of features I'd like to see.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.840]   But I like the idea of posting on my site.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.400]   The pictures live on my site.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   The posts live on my site.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.600]   But they get syndicated out to Facebook and Twitter and Flickr.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:55.840]   Yeah, very cool.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.160]   Let's see.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:58.640]   We're done.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.440]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.040]   Oh, he's gone.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.360]   Well, bye, Jeff.
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.880]   I heard the sad hangouts.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.880]   Goodbye, so--
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.440]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.320]   We partly knew he is Professor of Journalism
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:13.200]   at City University of New York, the author of What
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.080]   Would Google Do?
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.920]   Public Parts, a couple of great books.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.800]   Gutenberg the Geek, which is an Amazon single.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.680]   And he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.720]   And is really a public intellectual, somebody
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.920]   who's really out there in the world.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:31.080]   And talking about heavy stuff, deep stuff, even though people
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.440]   may not like it.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.640]   He's holding his own.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.920]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.200]   We do this week on Google Wednesday afternoons, 1 p.m.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:40.120]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:43.400]   That's 2,000 UTC, at least for another month,
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.680]   till our time changes.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.880]   And I hope you'll stop by live and watch the show.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.640]   But if you can't on-demand audio and video
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.920]   are available after the fact, at twit.tv/twig
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.480]   or wherever you get your podcast--

[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.360]   Cast, you know, all of those.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.280]   And don't forget, we have some really nice tweet apps
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.360]   created by some of our third party developers on iOS, Android,
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:10.240]   Windows Phone, Roku, yes.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.480]   So make sure you look on your mobile device for a tweet.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.200]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.440]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.220]   (upbeat music)
