[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.320]   Love your scroll bar.

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.080]   to show the covers everything having to do with the Google
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.720]   verse and all that stuff up in the cloud.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.800]   Joining us right now, it's great to have him
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   from his garden lair.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.720]   Kevin Marks of British Telecom, former Google
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   informal appler.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.760]   And I'm from now on going to introduce you
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.960]   as the father of podcasting.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   I think you deserve that credit, frankly.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.400]   One of the many fathers, I think.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.840]   Yes.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.800]   The first to demonstrate a working podcast client.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.560]   OK, that's true.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   Right?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680]   So that-- I mean--
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.280]   The first one to demonstrate one,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.160]   they got it onto the iPod, yes.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.720]   Yeah, I think that's pretty darn good.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.560]   So we owe it.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   By the way, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.440]   has decided to fight that Bizarro podcast patent.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.920]   I'm very--
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.160]   That's good.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   I send them a bunch of stuff for that as well.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.360]   And I know Dave and the others were too.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.200]   Yeah, and I think that's--
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.920]   Goodness.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800]   The person whom you're trying to reach
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   is currently unavailable.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.600]   And that would be Jeff Jarvis, who
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   will be joining us a little bit later on.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.520]   Jeff switched from Wi-Fi to ethernet,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   and it seemed to work fine.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.880]   And of course, I said, well, in some point,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.400]   it's not going to work.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.720]   Your Mac will suddenly decide, wait a minute.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.960]   He's pulled the rug out from under me.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   And in fact, that's exactly what happened.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   He was on here a minute ago.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880]   There we go.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now we've got him.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.320]   Right you were.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.560]   It always happens.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.200]   Always.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   We were talking about the fact that DeKeban is one
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.120]   of the fathers of podcasting this medium that we're using
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.480]   right here.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   And plus Adam Curry, plus Dave Weiner,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.920]   must we forget true?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.480]   But he predates both.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760]   Well, actually, in a sense, Weiner gets credit
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.560]   because he put the enclosure in RSS.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.280]   Why and how did it working inside radio,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.960]   and it would download the stuff with the hard drive?
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.200]   The thing that I did was put it onto the iPod.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.840]   So that was the addition I made, which I think made a difference.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.680]   I think so.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.760]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.560]   Just the hell.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.040]   We were also talking.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.320]   I now need a good bump for the Android.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.000]   And what I'm doing now is downloading them and copying them
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.280]   over.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.960]   I'm thinking I need to write something for the Android.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.480]   You don't use listen?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.160]   It doesn't seem to do what I want.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.120]   Maybe I should play with it again.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.200]   What do you want?
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.000]   What's it you want?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.320]   Well, OK.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.960]   Well, before we do that, I better bring in Gina here.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.480]   So Jeff--
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.400]   Bring in the others.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   And then we'll get to find out what you want.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.720]   Jeff Jarvis is here from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.800]   Great to have you, Jeff, the author of What Would Google Do.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.640]   And Gina Trapani, who is the author of the complete guide
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.840]   to Google Wave.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.340]   Hello, hello.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.040]   And this waving from Brooklyn, where both she and Jeff
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.080]   were about to get snowed under.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.520]   By I think it's 20 inches of snow you're expecting,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.080]   almost two feet.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.580]   Wow.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.000]   South of us, I think, in Washington.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.720]   And I think we're up here.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.800]   Gina, we're more like, what, 12?
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.680]   12, I think.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   I don't know.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   I feel like every time I look at the news,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   it gets higher, lower.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.520]   Who knows?
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360]   It's exciting, though.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.200]   Snow Angels.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   Weather is--
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Snow Angels.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.520]   Are you going to run out and do snow angels?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.200]   It's been a few years for me with snow, so I'm excited.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.480]   I have to admit, and I haven't been in snow in a long time.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.200]   That's always.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.000]   The first thing I do is fall back and go wave my arms
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.800]   and wave my legs and make an angel.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.200]   It's pretty pathetic, isn't it?
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   And people in California have no idea what we're talking about.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.080]   In Brooklyn, you have to do that right away,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.720]   because as soon as the snow is on the ground for a couple
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.440]   of hours--
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.480]   It's yellow, too.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.000]   It's ugly.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.480]   --that's ugly.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.880]   It's a yellow pretty big.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.520]   So what is it?
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.440]   We were talking about podcasting and Android,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   and Listen, which is Google's application for podcasting.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   I'm using that, but you think it's not adequate, Kevin?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.800]   Well, maybe I'm giving it another chance.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.920]   But what I want is slightly more subtle, which is I want
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.240]   to give me stuff that I want and to keep track of that
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.680]   and feed that back.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.560]   Part of this is part of the staff offline
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.840]   while I was commuting and that kind of thing.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.160]   And now I want a bit more from it.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.760]   I want to have the ability to comment on it.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.720]   I think there's more to be done there,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   making it more interactive and more
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.840]   two-way the way Twitter and the other.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.760]   You mean, you want it to be not just download stuff,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.360]   but you want it to be kind of more real-time.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.320]   So it's getting the programs in real-time.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.080]   Yeah, well, not quite real-time.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   No, I like being able to timeshift,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.080]   but I want to be able to react to them.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.760]   I mean, there's a nice thing called half duffer.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.480]   Have you seen that?
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.360]   No, this is a whole new way of thinking of podcasting me.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.240]   To me, podcasting was, I thought, a way
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.600]   that you subscribe to a show.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.200]   So it appears on your iPod at some time
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   after the show comes out and you listen to it.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.360]   But you want something much more interactive.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.200]   So what is this?
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.840]   I duffer?
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.960]   What is it called?
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.880]   Well, half duffer.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.000]   Half duffer, HUFFDUFFER.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.200]   What it does is it gives you a bookmarklet.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.280]   And every time you find an audio file you like,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.640]   you bookmark it and it creates you a podcast
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.600]   of those files and then you subscribe to that
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.760]   and you listen to them later.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.880]   So that's quite nice.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000]   So that means that as you wander around and find things,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.040]   you can share them there.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.120]   So it's like a, it's kind of like a delicious
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   for audio.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.120]   Interesting.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.640]   And does it doesn't have to be a podcast?
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.080]   No, it just has to be put in any MP3 or audio file will work.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.560]   It just has to be audio.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.880]   So that, I think that's the beginnings of this stuff.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.240]   I think, when we've started with a podcasting thing
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.440]   six years ago, there was always the thought of,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.600]   how do we make it easier to make these?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.840]   That is a bit easier now.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.400]   We have tools that help that.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.520]   But I think there's also, there's still more we could do there
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.200]   to make them more interactive and be able to respond
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.560]   to pieces of them and so on.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.680]   So I think there's space there and that's,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.400]   some of that plays with my thinking about voice stuff
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.680]   when I'm at BTST and then telephones and what smells
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.880]   like that.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.720]   I think from stuff that is coming at you
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.160]   and stuff that is two way to this partially asynchronous
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.280]   conversations, I think that's going to start getting interesting.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.640]   And I would add a third piece to that,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   which I'd like them to be more discoverable, easier to find.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.480]   If we can get all three of those working,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.080]   we might actually have something here.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.640]   Leo, you've talked about saying podcasts are kind of over
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.680]   and videos, what's next?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   Actually, I don't believe that.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.640]   I believe that, far from it, in fact audio is--
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.760]   Oh, over is strong, but you're changing your--
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.480]   Well, I don't by any means think that audio should be replaced
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.080]   by video.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   I think I'm a big fan of audio and for most people,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.320]   audio is a much easier thing to consume
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.000]   because there's a lot of time in the car in places
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.560]   where you can't watch video.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.760]   But what I do think is that podcasting hit a glass ceiling
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   about two years ago, and I think it was mostly
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   an issue of discovery, although I think some real-time stuff
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.400]   would help as well.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   But I think people just can't find them and have stopped looking.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.360]   It's the same problem I'm having with apps now.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.520]   Yeah, there's so many apps.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.400]   It's a filter failure problem.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.200]   I argued last week in a post--
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.080]   we'll talk a little bit about demand media
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.600]   and the crap off all around that.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.920]   But when you have over abundant content,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.240]   the value of curation is what increases.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.040]   And solving what Clacer he calls filter failure
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.720]   is really the key challenge we have.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.520]   And it's been the case since the internet came out.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.720]   It's what Yahoo tried to do is what Google does.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.200]   But it's something you can never catch up with.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.800]   Whenever we have something new, you
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.240]   have too much of it too quickly.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.440]   Podcast, Twitter, whatever.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   Apps.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.920]   Well, that's exactly what Hough Duffer does
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.720]   because you basically compile as a curator.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.080]   You compile a podcast of audio--
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.320]   so if you find interesting.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.640]   So I would basically follow your Hough Duffer, right?
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.480]   Kevin, and I would hear what you think is it?
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.360]   You get a bunch of audio that I like to look off.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.400]   I love that.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:13.920]   I love that.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.320]   If I go on this show, I'll put this show on it as well.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.920]   The problem with that, of course, is that podcasts are way
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.560]   too linear.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.400]   You can't skim them.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.120]   You can't find stuff in them.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.080]   You have to sit and listen to them.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   Well, that was-- there was an interesting day we
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.040]   had with NPR a month ago or so in San Francisco.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.520]   But they got together a bunch of people
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.080]   to talk about these ideas.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.960]   And something they're doing very nicely
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.160]   is they're chopping their shows up into segments
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.480]   so that what you can get from them
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.200]   is the five-minute story, not the 30-minute show.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.880]   I think that's interesting and important.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   I think that will help a lot as people start doing that.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.320]   Rather than saying, OK, here's an hour-long package,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.000]   it's like, here's the five-minute story,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040]   the next five-minute story, and the next five-minute story.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.680]   And you can skip over the ones you don't want.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.960]   And that creates a useful signal that you could then
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.200]   go back and share and say, here are the stories
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.880]   I listened to this morning for more edition.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.960]   And if Jeff does that and--
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.720]   you know, does that in New York for me, then by the time
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   I listen to it in California, I get the interesting ones
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.600]   from them.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.480]   I don't know where you--
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.640]   You see, you see, that's just a story,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.560]   but you also see the ability to link directly
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.800]   to deep link into audio and video.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.000]   And it becomes more possible now when
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.960]   you have the text coming onto the new automated
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.640]   subscript coming onto YouTube videos.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.480]   Yeah, but I hate to be a killjoy,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.840]   but how am I going to make any money at this?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.640]   Because there goes all the ads.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.720]   Right.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.400]   Well, I think it's the similar thing of blog discovery, right?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.120]   With blog discovery, you search something,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.600]   you find something in the blog, you read the blog,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.320]   and then eventually you'll ascribe to the blog.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   I think it's the same idea that you'll subscribe to the people,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.880]   you'll ascribe to the story.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.680]   That was always the thing--
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.640]   I think that's right, too, Kevin.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.320]   I think it's the same with being able to search books.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.880]   And you find an interesting thought in a book,
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.680]   and you're more likely to buy the book.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.200]   I think, Leo, the more your stuff is searchable,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.760]   our stuff, I should say.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.680]   The more people can go directly to a thought,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.080]   the more you have discovery.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.280]   Yeah, you're right, of course.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   It goes to the argument, you don't want to sound like Rupert
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.760]   Murdoch.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.200]   Right.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.760]   Try the accent again.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.520]   Now, you can't link in deep link in the My Podcast, mate.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:17.880]   Right.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.040]   You can deep link to my ads.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.800]   No, My Podcast.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.000]   Well, Eric Smith said last week that--
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.920]   or two weeks ago in his Wall Street Journal,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.360]   Op-Ed, that he's giving publishers 100,000 opportunities
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.600]   a minute to establish a relationship with someone,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.240]   I guess the hard part--
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.040]   you can see that easier in a text page
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.320]   because you can have relevant stuff around it, which
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.760]   is kind of the live story structure they're trying to go to.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.160]   In audio, it's going to be harder
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.920]   because you don't have a parallel stream of content in a way.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.960]   Someone's just hearing it.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.200]   You can't put an ad next to it or a link next to it.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.840]   Well, that's--
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.960]   But maybe you can do a five-second intro.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.440]   Say-- was it--
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:10:59.960]   Say Gina?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.560]   Go ahead.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.840]   Say Gina.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.080]   You could do a three-second or five-second intro
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.760]   thanks to so-and-so.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.040]   And then before you do the five-minute segment
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.840]   or the 10-minute segment--
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.960]   I mean, the nice thing about splitting up a show like this
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.760]   into five or 10-minute or 15-minute segments
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.000]   is that people could embed them and comment
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.800]   on something that we-- a particular story that we talked about.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.000]   And if they say embedded them on their blog,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.360]   if there's some way to automatically include
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.520]   some five-second intro.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.040]   I'm absolutely not adverse to that.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   In fact, the only reason I don't do it
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.840]   is just the manpower issue.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.720]   It's enough for us just to get these things out.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.160]   What I'd love is a tool that would make this possible
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.200]   for end users to do that.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.160]   In fact, we inquired if there were a way for a flash server
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.520]   to-- you could indicate in the flash player
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.000]   jump to this minute.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.480]   And it does require a special server to do that,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.120]   which we don't have access to.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   But that would be a great solution
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.480]   where we could just give you a mark and say,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.160]   here's where Gina starts her conversation about wave.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   Here's where Kevin starts his conversation about huff stuff.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.360]   And then people could go right there.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.840]   And I think that--
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.320]   Those permalinks allow people to gather around them.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.080]   Right.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.840]   Well, there are--
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.320]   And it's a loud--
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   --and it's a loud--
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.640]   --your argument about wave.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.720]   It depends how you're posting it.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.800]   There are champs and markers at empty fore.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.200]   And the reason I don't use that--
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.360]   Except for the first time you skip to them.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.240]   --is that's the end-text to work.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.400]   Yeah, it's a AC.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.440]   It's this enhanced thing.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.960]   And it's not only extra work.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   It doesn't work in a lot of players.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.600]   Well, I'm totally-- believe me.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.240]   I'm not against this at all.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.280]   I was being a little facetious in the ad thing.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.480]   I realized that our number one job
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.920]   is to get people to find and listen and consume our content.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   We can worry about the rest of it later.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.680]   I mean, YouTube allows for this, right?
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.160]   I mean, you can chop out segments of a video on YouTube
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.480]   and watch just that segment.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.840]   I know at least there's two--
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.160]   I think it's called tubechopped.com
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.560]   that lets you single out a particular segment within a video.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.600]   And that's timely because we are now on YouTube.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.640]   Thanks to you, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640]   Yay!
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.160]   Awesome.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.960]   So you can link into a timestamp at YouTube.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.760]   Yeah, you can do that.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   I'm not sure you can set an out point.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.320]   You can say it instead of an in point.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.040]   It has to have a specific kind of flash server.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.680]   And then you can say jump to this position.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.800]   With YouTube, I think you put #t equals and then a time.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.960]   And then it jumps to that, it's something like that.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Well, I would encourage all of our viewers to start doing that.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.480]   Sorry.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.360]   It was just more to the YouTube page, Leo.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.520]   Yeah, if you go to YouTube.com/twit,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.520]   we have a Twig channel.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.920]   We have a Twit channel, a Twif, and Mac Breakwiggling,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.640]   Windows Weekly, and we'll soon all be there.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.760]   Because Jeff Jarvis called his friends at Google.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   You're all going there now.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.560]   OK, that's fine.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   Sorry.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.400]   Jeff Jarvis--
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   I'm not running deaf.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.240]   Don't go there.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.800]   Jeff Jarvis called his friends at Google.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.560]   And we were awarded whatever this is, this special account
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.080]   that allows you to upload full-length stuff.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   And it's fantastic.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.640]   That's awesome.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.080]   In fact, we--
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   This is awesome.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.280]   Yeah, it's in high quality.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.440]   So I hope you'll start embedding this on your website.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   I'll play with that.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   It's cool.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   Yeah, we're very happy.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   What's the Twig channel?
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.080]   I don't see anything under /twig.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.000]   No, /twits.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.720]   YouTube.com/twit.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   OK.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.920]   So it's the whole network.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.000]   You're all-- we're all there.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.160]   You're all in one.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.520]   And then there's a Twig playlist, which I think
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.680]   is sufficiently granular.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.720]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.640]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.040]   I'm totally going to embed this.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.080]   And it's high quality.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   And so we're glad about that.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.680]   It's interesting.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.720]   When you first upload it, it's low quality.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.880]   And then I guess Google is choose on it.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.600]   And then it becomes high quality.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.360]   So yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.960]   I'm very happy about it.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.160]   I think the high quality in code takes longer.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   Yeah, I would gather.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.960]   We're not uploading in high def, but boy, the high quality
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.320]   does look good.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.960]   So I'm just-- you know what I have to do is I have to do some
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.400]   work on this page so that we can have an easier way to find
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.360]   the playlist and stuff.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.080]   But this last week's show is up there on Twig.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.920]   And again, thanks for their due to Steve Grove at YouTube
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.080]   who's in charge of the news and politics channels.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.800]   Thank you.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.640]   Boy, that's great news.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.360]   And thank you, Jeff, for pulling strings.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.160]   It's nice to have friends in high places.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.440]   But not live streaming yet.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.040]   And I think in some day, we will have this ability to just
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.480]   say, hey, here's the relevant issue.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.160]   People for people to blog and so forth.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.480]   This is kind of the problem in general with audio and video.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.160]   Is it just nonlinear?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.600]   I mean, it is linear, rather.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.560]   And it's not easily searchable.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.200]   And it's not easily linkable to a small part of it.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.320]   Let's move on you.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.840]   You like Charlie Strauss's 21st century phone piece I see,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.440]   Kevin Marks.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.880]   That's an interesting thing.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.800]   I thought that was pretty good.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.200]   Did you have a chance to read that?
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.440]   I just saw your link just now.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.240]   It's from anti-pope.org.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.680]   Google-- I'm sorry, gadget patrol, 21st century phone.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.760]   This is in a product review.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.000]   It's a big picture overview.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.360]   So what is-- he's talking about the phone of the future
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.600]   or is that the only one?
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.120]   Yes.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.320]   So his basic thesis is that the self-uncompanies
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.600]   have been trying really hard not to be commodity pipes,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.680]   whereas Apple and Google have an interest in them
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.120]   becoming that, especially Google.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.600]   So that's the sort of overview of it.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.120]   But he's got some very good analysis there.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.440]   If you don't know, Charlie, he's a brilliant science fiction
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.840]   writer.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.480]   He's written a whole series of great ones, some comedy ones
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.440]   and he was a bit of the Hugo this year.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.800]   He wrote a near future one called Haulting State,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.120]   which was about five years time in Scotland.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.080]   There's a bank crisis in an artificial bank
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.320]   and a bunch of stuff like that.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.360]   So he said, this is from the Haulting State.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.240]   This is his prediction that effectively what Google is
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   trying to do with the phone is turn the cell phone carriers
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.840]   into a mere pipe so that they're
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   a way to access the internet.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   That's his analysis.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.360]   And I think there's a fair bit of truth in that.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.840]   He says, Apple is an experienced company, a high end mark.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.240]   They don't want to destroy the telcos.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.760]   They just want to use them as a conduit
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.480]   to sell their user experience.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.360]   Google is an advertising corporation.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.440]   Their whole business model is predicated on breaking down
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.920]   barriers to access, barriers which
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.360]   stop the public from accessing rich internet content
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.480]   plastered with Google's ads.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   We said that before.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.320]   That's all Google wants.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.640]   They just want a better internet because it's
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   a better delivery medium for their business.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   So he says, Google want--
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.560]   Google want-- I want to say wants, but he must be British.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.800]   Google wants--
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.300]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.240]   It's British.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.800]   I knew it because they just always get that.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.400]   They always-- companies in Britain are collective nouns.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.240]   Yep.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.960]   Google want the mobile industry communications--
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.360]   mobile communications industry to switch to version two,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.720]   version two, pure bandwidth competition.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.280]   In fact, they'd be happiest.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.520]   Promise he switches back and forth because now that Google
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.720]   is they again.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.040]   In fact, they'd be happiest if the mobile networks would go
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.640]   away, get out of the user's faces, and hand out free data
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.560]   terminals with unlimited free bandwidth.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.760]   But that's not going to happen.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.880]   And it's the same thing that's happened with cable and television
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.680]   companies, like Comcast.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.040]   They-- of course, there's all this pressure for them
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   to become pure bandwidth companies.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.280]   And their response to this is there's not enough money
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.160]   in selling bits.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.200]   We have to sell premium content, exactly the same position
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.120]   the telcos have.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.200]   Why do you think Google wants the white spaces to become
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.040]   super-wifi?
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.360]   Right.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.240]   So we finally get competition in that.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.160]   And we get other opportunities to get bandwidth.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   Or the idea that bandwidth becomes
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.880]   a right in this country.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.680]   And that we see what happens there.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.040]   What comes out of that?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   If we just imagined a world of truly ubiquitous broadband,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.440]   I was talking with a consultant.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.320]   I'm going to blog about next week about the postal service.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.640]   And you start to see a world where you really don't need one.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.080]   And how much money do we all save in the economy from that?
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.440]   There's all kinds of implications to having--
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.800]   But you guys, I mean, you're starting
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   to sound like crazy hippies because they're
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.760]   huge commercial forces in this company pushing just--
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.560]   just as hard back in the other direction.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.920]   They don't want to go this way.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.040]   Do you think this will happen inevitably anyway?
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.200]   I think so at some point.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.480]   The value to Google is so great.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.080]   I can't find it.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.760]   I thought I had put up a link to a post
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.040]   going through the economics about how Google could give away
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.840]   the Nexus One, its alleged phone for free.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.320]   And it's not hard to get there.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.960]   No, it's easy to get there with advertising.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   And it's not hard to get a spend with for free.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.320]   It's hermaphroditic economics.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.080]   You don't know who's doing what to whom these days.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.160]   So what's our consensus?
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.400]   Is Nexus real?
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.280]   Is Google starting in January going to sell a phone
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.920]   and undermine its partnerships with Verizon and T-Mobile?
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   Oh, I hope.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.600]   It appears that that's what's going to happen.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.480]   It sounds like January 5th is the--
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.960]   it's not confirmed, but that seems to be the date coming
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.440]   from a few different sources.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.800]   But it sounds like it's going to be a lot of--
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.200]   Google, by the way, Google says, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   We're not going to compete with our channels.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.880]   I think they're going to set it up
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.240]   and just say, oh, you're going to have to use this on a channel
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.800]   and you can use it on a channel.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.240]   You can just do so without a contract.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   So you think they're playing language games?
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.120]   They've been selling phones for over a year, right?
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.240]   They sold the G1 for two months.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.120]   As a developer tool only.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.800]   And the Nexus 1 maybe may just be the next evolution of that
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.200]   in people's jumping to conclusions,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.400]   or they may have some other plans.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.160]   Well, that's the question.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.800]   But they can say on a lock phone for over a year.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.120]   And there are other ones you can get.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.680]   Yeah, but how many?
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.720]   They've sold a few thousand.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.240]   I mean, it's de minimis.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.640]   I mean, T-Mobile doesn't care.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.360]   Verizon doesn't care because people aren't going to buy them
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.400]   from Google for 300 bucks when they can get it with--
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   Well, but then if you need to put a statement at you
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.000]   got to buy that from the channel anyway.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.440]   Right.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.600]   They make their money.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.960]   You can use them as a wife.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.440]   Now I can take my iPhone.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.920]   I wouldn't buy the droid before because I'd
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.320]   have to commit to $2,400.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   And then would I spend $400, $500, even for Nexus 1?
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.680]   And swap out my SIM card for my iPhone?
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.400]   You bet.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.560]   Huge opportunity for T-Mobile here.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.880]   If they could get their high speed data network everywhere
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.440]   and say-- and they've already said this.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.880]   They've already got the-- you don't
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.960]   have to buy a phone from us.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.640]   You can go month to month.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.440]   We'll give you a flat rate.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.120]   This is a chance for them to go to fifth from fifth to first,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.960]   at least with the geeks.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.800]   Absolutely.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.440]   But will they do it?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.560]   It's going to be interesting January.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.840]   And they do it.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.240]   So yeah, that's-- you know, I have to say looking
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.840]   at the Nexus 1-- have you played with one, Kevin?
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.000]   It looks like a really nice phone.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.400]   I haven't seen one yet, no.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.240]   Looks spectacular.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.400]   Well, you weren't for anyone who's actually seen one.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.000]   I have talked to-- we talked to somebody who
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.960]   was played with one who was very impressed.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.760]   And he said it's-- in fact, the general response from people
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.720]   who've played with them is surprisingly snappy.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.960]   I think it's an A9 processor, Cortex-A9 in there,
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.640]   which is the fastest--
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.960]   There's also the report of the, quote, "weirdly large" camera.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.760]   And my theory on this is that it will improve Google goggles.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.240]   Is that true that it's a big camera?
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.960]   I saw that weirdly large.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.880]   That was from TechCrunch.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.160]   Nobody else has confirmed that.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.800]   And my friend who played with one said it was completely just
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.880]   like a droid camera.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.160]   So, you know, five megapixels--
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.280]   And the question was very big.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   Yeah, it's five megapixels.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:21:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.400]   And it has flash.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.520]   I think Google goggles works fine with a droid camera.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.480]   I think it's what you need.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.200]   What the key is not megapixels, it's autofocus.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.320]   Apple showed that with this 3.2.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.520]   It's that autofocus is the key for things like reading,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.080]   you know, these barcodes, these short codes,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.640]   and for scanning and text and logos.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.080]   I wasn't that impressed with goggles
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.560]   after playing with for a while.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.400]   Really?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.480]   Yeah, well, it doesn't--
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.240]   Oh, really?
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   Yeah, it's not very--
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.040]   It's not very--
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.080]   I wanted to work on faces.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.040]   That's the need I have.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.520]   So do I, badly.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.200]   That is coming.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.600]   Really?
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.720]   You think so, Jeff?
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.080]   I was at an event that was supposed to be off the record.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.440]   I won't say who said it.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.640]   But it was a certain high level executive
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.280]   from a certain company said, yeah, basically, it's almost
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.520]   there.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.080]   It's just a ticklish thing to do.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.040]   I got an email.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.120]   I got an email, a very angry email.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.480]   Because I said the same thing.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.520]   And I said, look, the government already
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.440]   has this technology.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.840]   Let's put it back in the hands of people.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.800]   Because the feds got it, of course.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.000]   And I got a very angry email from a person
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.400]   who raised a very good point, said,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.800]   I have a family member who was assaulted
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.680]   because a stalker was able to find information about her
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   on the internet, including her home.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.160]   Do you really think it's such a good idea for strangers
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.520]   to have a device that they can say on that girl's cute
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.080]   and find out everything about her?
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.280]   Right, well, the problem is, Leo,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.200]   we always come back to this.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.920]   Can you take any given device and say that it could be used
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.760]   to do harm, and then we live to the lowest common denominator?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.720]   There is a risk at anything.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.880]   There's a risk to kitchen knives at some point.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.200]   But the power of visual search is incredible.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.960]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.040]   Absolutely incredible.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.280]   And the power of search around an annotated world,
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.920]   do you tell me about this place where I am?
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.320]   Tell me about this thing I'm holding.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.120]   Tell me about this person I'm seeing.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.440]   And also let me comment on any of those things
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   that add information to the world about those things
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.120]   is so damn powerful that, yes, I understand the risk.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.960]   There is risk.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.800]   There's risk to privacy.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.080]   There's a lot of things.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.920]   But--
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.720]   And the thing is, we're already doing this, right?
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.360]   We're already doing this with Picasso and Facebook
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.200]   and iPhoto.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.520]   We're already annotating all our photos of our friends.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.360]   If you just searched that, that would be useful to me.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.680]   If you just said, OK, this is that person
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.840]   you met last week in Paris, that would be really handy.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.640]   Love that.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.040]   Oh, I'd love that feature.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.320]   Maybe that's what they do.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.680]   Maybe they don't do it in real time.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.000]   You have to snap a photo.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.600]   I mean, I think there's a firestorm, however,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.000]   facing Google if they do this.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   Yep.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.120]   That's why they haven't done it.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.720]   Oh, definitely.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.640]   Because of the free things.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.440]   And they know that.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.040]   I think that there's some way you're
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.640]   going to find the power of it.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.720]   I wrote a post this week about trying to put together--
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.360]   Gina wrote a wonderful post about 2009 and all of Google.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.440]   And I did my bad version of it, trying
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.040]   to just put together all these things we talked about last week
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.080]   and see where this heads.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.320]   And you start to see the idea that the search becomes
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.200]   visual and oral.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.400]   Google gets better and better and better at sound search.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.120]   The fact that Yelp and such--
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.040]   we'll talk about it soon, I'm sure--
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.080]   becomes an effort to get social around something local.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.200]   It becomes really powerful in ways
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.600]   that I don't think we can even imagine yet.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.720]   But, Gina, you're the sole woman here.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.920]   I mean--
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.760]   It creeps me out.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.280]   It creeps me out.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.680]   The idea that somebody could take a picture of me
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.200]   and get Google search results from my name.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.400]   Because it's scary.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.960]   I bookmarked this last week and we never
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.040]   got around to talking about it.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.560]   But Eric Schmidt was quoted--
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.000]   I think it was in that Google special that we all
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.200]   missed that aired on CNBC or MSNBC.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.760]   I guess he was asked about privacy.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.960]   What about people who feel like that they want privacy
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.200]   and they don't want any company to have so much information
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.640]   about them?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.520]   And he was quoted as saying something along the lines of,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.320]   if you need that kind of privacy,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.400]   then you probably shouldn't be doing the thing that you're
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.480]   doing.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.160]   That just-- that really--
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.680]   Yeah, that was--
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.040]   Wait, by the way, I know we didn't talk about it on Twig.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.400]   I should have seen it for you.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.960]   I know we didn't talk-- yeah, well, exactly.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.080]   We didn't talk about this on Twig.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.160]   But we did talk about it on Twig the next day.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.120]   And in fact, the name of that show is Schmidt Happens.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.240]   And I think appropriately-- and that's
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.880]   exactly the point I brought up, Kevin Marks.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.160]   We had Jason Howell from CNN.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.200]   And I said, wait a minute.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.720]   Didn't Eric Schmidt--
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.840]   embargo CNET for a year because they published details
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.880]   that they had found on Google about Eric Schmidt?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.640]   Yeah, it was--
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   Steve--
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   Yeah, right?
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.920]   When that kind of attitude is going on, it scares me a little
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   bit.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.080]   And as someone who has had trouble with harassment online,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.440]   I don't want--
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.280]   I have a private mailbox that I use because I don't want anyone
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.720]   to be able to find my address.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.040]   I use a Google Voice number.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.840]   So it's a mask my actual phone number.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.720]   Like, I'm--
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.040]   like most people kind of a freak about where
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   I enter in, kind of identifiable information.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.520]   But more and more, I do it.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.280]   And we all do it, right?
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.800]   Because the balance between risk and convenience,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.000]   the convenience that you get for the risk is often outweighs it.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.360]   But still, the idea that someone can take a photo of me
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.040]   from wherever without my knowledge, which you can do in
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.600]   public very easily, and do a Google search result and get my
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.400]   name back and whatever search results there are, it freaks
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.920]   me out.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.960]   Then again, I mean, if someone has my name, which isn't a
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.400]   stretch, they can Google me just by typing it in.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.280]   So I guess it's not that much of a leap.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.000]   And they can go to Facebook and see you staying in a crowd
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.720]   and see you have no connection to you, but see you annotated,
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.920]   have your name, and then go.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.520]   I mean, I agree with the creepiness level, but I think
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.960]   that there's also--
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   what you end up with at some point is you have the law of
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.640]   the land works across any medium in any technology.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.600]   And we know how well that works.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.080]   But we have to worry about that more.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.360]   I think there needs to be more stalking laws and things
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.880]   like that, which we enable us to be.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.800]   Because the issue to me is, I always say, is in privacy,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.960]   it's control.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.120]   I need to be able to control my information, control how it's
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   used, control the connections I have with people, and give
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.280]   me control over that.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.640]   And if I don't, that's the problem.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.360]   You go to other issues like the--
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.720]   what I was talking about here before, the theory of
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   mutually assured humiliation, that we all have embarrassing
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.760]   things, which I think is what Schmitt's really saying.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   If you really have something embarrassing online, then
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.120]   that's probably the question.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.240]   Yeah, but if you're the guy who has the least
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.440]   embarrassing things online, then you win.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Right?
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.840]   Well, I think that's the problem.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.680]   It's supposed to become the dullest person on Earth.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.360]   Maybe.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.280]   And nobody cares about you.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.440]   I heard a story I listened this morning to this week's On
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.920]   the Media, the public radio show.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.800]   And they had a segment from a guy who was giving a funeral
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.840]   for his name.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.560]   He had written a story, I think, in the Harvard paper
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.960]   about picking up closeted college jocks.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.920]   Oh, boy.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.800]   And it was very popular, and it rises to the first of search.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.160]   Oh, boy.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.120]   But now he wants to be a fourth grade teacher.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.360]   Too late.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.840]   Nope.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.640]   He's legally changing his name.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.840]   And so his mother is there crying about not being able to
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.240]   use his name.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.200]   But hoping that sometime this won't matter as much so he
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.600]   can start to do it again.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.320]   But he held a funeral party awake for his name.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.720]   Maybe he shouldn't have done that.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.160]   I mean, look--
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.680]   That's the Google publish.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.160]   His new name.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.640]   In a couple of weeks, we'll be arguing whether Google should
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.800]   have cross-references to previous names.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.880]   I mean, come on.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.240]   Right.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.640]   They didn't use his real name on the piece.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.200]   Let's call him Peter, they said.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.720]   That's interesting.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.040]   Can you change your name and change your history?
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.080]   Not with face recognition.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.560]   What was the other issue about that is that in blogs and now
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.120]   in news, we argue that you don't erase your mistakes.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.520]   You cross them out and show they were there.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.680]   And that's the ethical thing to do.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.320]   To try to change history, we don't consider ethical in the
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.240]   blog world, right?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.720]   Right.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.600]   Somebody in the chat room said, you know, you could always
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.160]   just ask somebody their name.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.240]   It's called socializing.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.360]   No.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:02.880]   No.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.560]   We don't want to do that.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.040]   Let's line letter 261.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.440]   But who are you really?
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.280]   I find it interesting.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.640]   We've had two subjects here.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.920]   In both cases, there's a lot of pressure from one group that
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.640]   wants this, which is either cell phone carriers or cable
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.160]   companies becoming pure bit purveyors, the other being
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.760]   Google giving us face recognition.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.880]   There's this force in one direction, and there's this force
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.640]   in the other direction.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.840]   It's very interesting how these tensions arise in this new
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   world where you have--
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.400]   and I think very reasonably, these are really tough things
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.440]   to solve.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.640]   And I'm not sure how I would go on this face recognition
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.160]   thing.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.480]   I think they're both good arguments in both cases.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   What's the next step here?
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.520]   If you have a photo that exists of someone, and the first
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.520]   step is the annotation of it.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.040]   So if I don't know Gina at all, she's among some people,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.840]   I think, who the hell is that?
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.720]   Somebody says that Gina Trapani, I can search that
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.280]   created a connection that wasn't there.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.800]   Gina could have tried to be very private.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.640]   That's the issue with Facebook photos.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.680]   An annotation, right?
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.520]   The next step is whether or not that photo that already
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.280]   exists, I could do face recognition to find out who that
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:14.560]   is.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.280]   I can do that today.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.800]   There have been services for the last couple of years
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   been promising that.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.280]   The next step that we're talking about here is only that I
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.200]   can snap you in person and find out who you are.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   At least there, you can see me doing it.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.440]   Right.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:27.960]   The thing you're--
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.560]   There's this huge comforting note that you'd have to ask
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.960]   someone else who I knew or who was in the photo with me,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.240]   who I was, or one of those people would have to tag me.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.640]   I mean, the thing is your face is well known now.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.320]   So you could mechanical Turk it.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.440]   We could put the photo up to the Amazon thing and say, who
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.120]   is this?
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.200]   And someone could go around and say, oh, that's Gina.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.560]   I recognize that.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.040]   Jonathan Zitreim was talking about this at Supernova.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:55.000]   He says, there are police doing this.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.440]   They had a big photo of a bunch of student protesters.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.640]   And they were putting the faces up on mechanical Turk, saying,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.000]   do you know who this is?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.560]   We'll pay you $0.10 to identify the people in this photograph
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.400]   so that we can serve them with a arrest warrant.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.640]   So the difficulty is that you can now
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.480]   use these other tools, these distributed human-based tools
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.800]   to do this stuff that the machine-based stuff can have a go at,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.320]   too.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   I mean, the machine-based rotation isn't that good.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.600]   I mean, we've all played with the car, sir, and the iPhone,
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   and so on.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.760]   And mostly, it'll get some of them.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.160]   It'll get the ones that-- you say, OK, this is Kevin.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.200]   It'll find the ones that look very similar to that.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.560]   But half the time, it'll say, my son is me,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   or my other son is me, or something as well.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.280]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   Whereas the human-based stuff on Facebook is much more,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.000]   it's like, no, that's Kevin.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   Even if it's me with a funny hat on or something,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.080]   people will be tagging me with that.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.200]   I guess you're right.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.440]   In some ways, this is the genie that's
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.000]   going to get out of the bottle one way or the other.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.240]   So we have to deal with our education.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.960]   We have to deal with our laws and our cultural views of this.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.080]   And rethink public misinprivacy.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.880]   I think it'd be a mistake to go to a complete lockdown
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.560]   on privacy, because as Lenin, 2-6-0-1, just said,
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.240]   we do want to socialize.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.520]   And we want these connections to happen.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.240]   We can't be ruled by the one possibility
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.320]   that something goes wrong.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.280]   We have to be cautious about that instead.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.240]   I mean, the other thing--
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.440]   I think we're going--
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.240]   Sorry.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.760]   Sorry, go ahead, Kevin.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.040]   Dana Boyd spoke at both Supernova and LaWeba about this,
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.920]   which is that we are now publishing more and more
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.640]   of their lives online, but we're still not using that to do good,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.480]   using that to find people and help them.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.640]   And I thought that was a really strong one.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.040]   I disagree with that.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.280]   She's saying there were powerless people who
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.200]   put stuff up online, and nobody pays attention
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.000]   until they do something bad, and then suddenly they'll
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.600]   work with them.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.400]   I disagree with that.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.720]   And I'll unfortunately will raise the specter of my people
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.360]   in the business again.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   At least it's going up.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.720]   OK, go ahead.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.960]   Incredible things happen.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.480]   Wonderful things happen.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   That couldn't have gotten the support and the information
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.360]   that I got back if I had not chosen to put myself out there.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.720]   There's certainly benefits to living in public.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.400]   I think that's true.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.880]   But her point was that there are people
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:26.080]   who aren't as privileged as us, who don't feel safe doing this
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   because they didn't have the ability
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.640]   to hide from the bad people effectively.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.560]   And if you had a chance, watch Dana's talk from Supern
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.440]   Overall Away, but I think both of them are up online.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.560]   Really recommend that as a corrective.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   It certainly made me stop and think about what we're doing.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.960]   But that's no reason to say, well,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.880]   stop putting stuff online.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.280]   Well, no, no.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.400]   I think Jeff made the point originally
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.640]   is that the thing is that the authorities already have it.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.360]   They have the ability.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.320]   I suppose that's potentially what Schmidt was saying, too.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.040]   He says they're the government.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.960]   They have nuclear weapons.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.360]   They can get the data from us if they force us to.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.560]   That's the--
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   the bottom line, it comes down to that.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.240]   And the challenge is can we then give that data to ourselves
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.120]   and use that for good as well?
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   If we can get the information ourselves and use it,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.000]   we can probably make more sense of it
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.520]   than a random stranger can because we have some idea of who
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.080]   our friends are and what's going on.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.680]   Is there--
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.400]   An interesting related issue.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.640]   I'm going to-- there's a thing called the Personal Genome
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.800]   Project.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.920]   And Harvard geneticist George Church is doing this.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.680]   They want to collect 100,000 genomes
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.880]   and match it to phenotype information,
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.440]   weight, height, baldness, medical history, that kind of thing.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.240]   So it's a very valuable database so that they can figure out,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:50.200]   perhaps, what gene expression has to do with some medical history
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   and that kind of thing.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   And they do an interest.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.160]   So I'll volunteer to that.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.680]   I'm going to do this.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.200]   Esther Dyson has done a number of people who have done it.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.600]   And what they say in this is we're not
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.680]   going to protect your privacy.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.000]   We can't.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.900]   So you should know that forever more, your genotype
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.600]   will be in public along with your complete medical history
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.200]   and your name.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.000]   We could have made an attempt to protect this,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.720]   but we know that we're not going to be able to do it.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   So we're just going to not even try.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.680]   And so when you volunteer, you say, yeah, OK, fine.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.600]   And maybe that'll make it hard for me to get insurance
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.480]   down the road or whatever.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.800]   And one of the reasons I'm doing this,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.640]   I'm going to publicize it.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.000]   But because I don't have much to fear from that.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.880]   And I think people need such a valuable database.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.280]   And you create value with it.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.880]   I argue in my book that when we get to the point where not sharing
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.040]   data becomes seen as antisocial, quite literally,
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.320]   23andMe has a survey out about your reaction to H1N1.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.720]   And at some point, by sharing more of this data publicly,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.280]   we're going to find correlations that we couldn't have found before.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.480]   But we can only do that if people are generous with their data.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.400]   Maybe that's what Schmidt was saying is we need to get over this stigma.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.840]   We're stigmatizing information.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.040]   And now some of us, like you, Jeff, are kind of pioneers in this area.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.640]   Or obnoxious about it, whatever.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.040]   Well, I think some of us have less to risk than others.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.400]   You know, if I were Gina, I wouldn't do this.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.600]   If I were a woman of any stripe, I don't want to choose it.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.040]   Whether you choose control.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.480]   Right.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.240]   You don't need everyone to do this.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.360]   It's the Wikipedia.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.320]   You don't need every human on Earth to give their experience here.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.560]   You need a statistical number who were generous enough.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.120]   Or exhibitionistic enough.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.240]   So let's talk about Yelp, because this is the big rumor now that Google is
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.360]   planning or offering or thinking about.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.960]   And it's not confirmed by Google to spend half a billion dollars to acquire
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:47.280]   Yelp, although in conjunction with Google goggles, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.840]   Jeff, do you have any knowledge about this?
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.680]   Is this going to happen?
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.280]   No knowledge.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.640]   I mean, Michael, Larry, and Ted Crunches is where I start.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.000]   Mike, by the way, has a history of rumors like this that never pan out.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.360]   So I'm always a little bit skeptical.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.200]   I love Mike, but I'm always a little, you know, like, OK, well, that's one data point.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.960]   It's interesting to me, because what I said was, watch out or put it another way.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.800]   Newspapers and phone companies lost this opportunity.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   They could have owned this level of information that Yelp has.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.400]   They should have.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.240]   They had it.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   It's like communities.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.720]   And so there's great power there.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.960]   And I think that the next frontier for Google, besides the things we talked about last week,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.440]   like more intent and search, is local mobile.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:38.160]   And that Yelp gives them an incredible amount of data for local venues.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.040]   It improves the place page, which improves maps, which improves navigation, which
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.920]   improves local advertising.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.320]   And they bought AdMob.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.600]   Yelp is also potentially a backdoor to social.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.320]   I'll be curious to hear what Kevin and Gina say about this, because it's an opportunity
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.280]   to say that you're--
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.320]   I saw one post that I think I put up on the friend feed that wondered whether this was
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.120]   a side way to get to four square.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.880]   And that you're talking about places and you're gathering around places and giving that data
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.480]   and people are doing it, and that it's a social thing as well.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.800]   I think that's less important.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.000]   I think this is a huge opportunity for Google in terms of local, and it has been newspapers
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.920]   and phone companies and yellow pages to lose.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   Any thoughts?
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   The yellow pages have lost it.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.920]   Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   It's amazing to be--
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   It's amazing to be--
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   I put it straight in the recycling bin.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.360]   It's amazing to even know that people are still chopping down trees to print these ridiculous
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.200]   books that nobody can use in it.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.120]   Does anybody use the yellow pages?
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.320]   Or maybe we're just early in that there's still people using it.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.160]   So considering how well Donnie is doing, the Yellow Page publishers are doing, no, you're
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   right, they're not--
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   Somebody's you.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.160]   Somebody's--
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.560]   Gina, you're the youngest one here.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   She's--
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   This sounds--
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   I'm not saying it.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.200]   I mean, but Yellow Page is part of how we found information.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.320]   Were they ever for you?
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.600]   Do you even know what they are, Gina?
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.400]   I mean, they're part of how I reached the really tall shelf in the kitchen.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.560]   I'm like, kind of stuck off.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.240]   I mean, I really never remember using the Yellow Page as an antagonist.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   Oh, my car.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.760]   Maybe when I first started to use the phone and I was eight or nine, but not very much
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   now.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.200]   Or even a phone book?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   Anybody use a phone book?
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   Like a paper address book.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.600]   I mean, how about one of those for a while?
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.120]   I mean, remember they printed white pages, too.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   Oh, the white pages.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   Yeah, the white pages.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.040]   Yeah, me and my friends would go to the white pages and try and find funny names.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.920]   Yeah, that's what it was good for.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   Yes.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.720]   When prank calling was kind of--
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.800]   Do they still print the white pages?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Yes or no?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   Am I wrong?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.480]   They still print white pages, right?
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   I guess they have to.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.040]   There's got to be a set of the population that's not online.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:00.080]   Boy, that really shows you why, in fact, being online is a human right.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.360]   Because it's not long before you're not going to get that stuff.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.920]   That's why France did Minitel, right, in the '80s, was so that they didn't have to print
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   yellow or white pages.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.520]   They saved money and brought more people to the country.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.720]   They gave it everybody a free terminal.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.080]   Well, that's where I think, Leo, that's where I think, if you really go the full extent
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.960]   of the rumor mill and go beyond Nexus One to the latest rumor that's also goes back,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.080]   that Google's going to do a Chrome OS machine themselves, at some point it's worth it to
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.760]   get everyone in the country a machine.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.520]   Why does Google need to do hardware?
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.480]   Because they can, because they can give it away?
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.920]   Because they can change the economics.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.160]   They could just say, "We'll just going to give it away."
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.680]   It just sounds like a--
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.880]   Talk about disruptive.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.400]   At some point, the US federal government is going to just say, "You're breaking too
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.160]   many businesses."
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:59.280]   You know, you're not a monopoly, but-- I mean, is there a societal consequence to a company
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   like Google that is so disruptive to everything we know?
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.080]   I mean, they aren't putting everything on it.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   Or is this another case of--
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.080]   That's Google.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.080]   It's internet.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   Well, that's my question.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.000]   Or is this just a case of inevitable?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And we just better--
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.280]   That's the broadest, broadest companies that give away devices, right?
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.640]   In the UK, you can get a netbook that you don't pay for.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.800]   You're just paying the subscription fee for the connectivity that they've been out for
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   a couple of years.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   These exist.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   People show anyone's doing that in the US, but that may just be because the carriers haven't
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.960]   really come up with it yet.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.840]   Most of the time you get these onerous two-year contracts.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:42.280]   And that is enough-- people have quickly realized that that's actually a huge cost of
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   thousands of dollars.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.840]   And I don't think it's-- you can get a netbook for $50, but you have a two-year deal.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   So--
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.640]   Google would say, "Do we really want government to come in?"
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.040]   Yeah, I mean, this is what I want.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   Right.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   Sorry, Janet, go ahead.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.840]   I was going to say, this is what I want to see.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.960]   I want to see Google just stop this stupid contract madness.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   And you know--
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   They could, in one--
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   --make this actually work for users.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.760]   With one stroke of the pen, they could disintermediate the phone companies.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.360]   They could put netbook manufacturers out of business.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   I mean, they could change the landscape.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.400]   You see, Leo, you're operating-- you are playing back what we hear so often about,
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   well, Google destroys something.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.720]   Well, that's the economics of entitlement at a corporate level.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   That's the sociopath thing.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   It's the sociopath thing.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.720]   It's the sociopath thing.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   Aaron Schwartz calls them sociopaths.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   It's the sociopath.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.360]   This breaks list stole from them.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   Right.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.400]   Craig is the grandest philanthropist who left money in the pockets of the transactors
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.000]   and took it away from the middleman.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.480]   So who's to say that we should suddenly protect some old industry from Google or the internet
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.440]   and make life worse for consumers?
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   That's absurd.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.680]   Aaron Schwartz says, "Naturally, the sociopaths are outraged that their control is being taken
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   away.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.560]   Newspapers, book publishers, television companies, ad agencies, their businesses are all failing
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.880]   while Google's is on the rise.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.200]   The sociopaths may be outraged, but this is exactly what's supposed to happen.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.840]   Most people don't have a vested interest in whether ABC does well or even continues to
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   exist.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.200]   What they want are good television shows at a reasonable price, and if they can get those
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.320]   from Apple and Google instead of their local cable company, bully for Apple and Google."
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   Right.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.040]   So Gina, you're rooting for this to happen.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.320]   And if government stepped in to stop it from happening, you'd be enraged, right?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.800]   Yeah, but- Yeah, definitely.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.280]   So really though, but wait a minute.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.240]   We're dropping businesses and screwing up consumers.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.560]   But wait a minute, government represents businesses in the same way it represents individuals.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   Oh.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.760]   I'm going to bet that Kevin Marc studied that at Oxford or Cambridge or somewhere.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   Tell us.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   Physics.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   Physics.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   Physics.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Physics.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   It's not going to help you.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Physics is no use here.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.600]   Well, companies are legal persons in the US and to some extent the US.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Absolutely.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.320]   But government protects property.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   Let's be very clear.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.280]   Government really doesn't protect individuals, it protects property.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.760]   Except that we have a political will.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.240]   The problem is we don't have the lobbyists.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.960]   So that's why the political structure is broken.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.600]   It's because we don't have the people, common cause aside, don't have the lobbyists to fight
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   for that against- You're talking about revolution.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.600]   This is a revolution.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.640]   This is an economic revolution.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   Yes.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.080]   The question is whether it'll be a velvet revolution.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.800]   Well, the problem is this.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.920]   It's about things getting smaller, right?
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.160]   It's about a deflation that occurs when everything gets cheaper.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.320]   And that's innovation and Moore's law makes everything cheaper today.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.440]   And that's not the way the economy was built.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.520]   The company was built on centralized control and making things more expensive and what
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.920]   the market would bear.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.400]   And you charge as little as you can bear now to be as big as you can be.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   And it changes the fundamentals of economics.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   And I did horribly in economics class.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   George Gilder wins.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   Oh, Uma- You, Uma-ha-k?
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.000]   You've been meeting his recent stuff?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.720]   No, tell us about that.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:10.880]   So he was saying basically a lot of the businesses that exist are not creating value.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.800]   They're just moving it around and extracting some of it.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   And he says his bet for the future is on businesses that are creating actual value by
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.160]   returning it to the people who are using it.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.880]   So the craziest example is a good one.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.560]   They're rather than charging and make extract the most money from brokering it.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.640]   Craig made sure that most of the money went to the people using it.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.600]   The other thing that sort of leads to this was John Hagel's stuff at Supernova where
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.680]   he was looking at return on assets for companies since the '60s.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.720]   And he basically said it's been going down.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.280]   What's happened is they're not making money from being large anymore.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.000]   And any money they do make is either extracted by the customers as better value or by the
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.240]   individuals within the company who extract it as wages.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.920]   The corporations themselves aren't keeping it anymore.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:03.280]   In order to effectively the old Cozyan theory of the firm where a firm exists because it's
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.000]   transaction costs are lower, it's no longer true in this age.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.800]   And it's easier for us as individuals to lower transaction costs collectively than it is
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   for a company to do it bureaucratically.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.680]   That's a big change.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.520]   So if Google does something that yes, destroys an industry but that benefits all of us in
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:27.880]   huge ways, the industries are going to scream like stopcakes as they are but do they really
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.880]   have a right to?
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.400]   No, but I think if they only did it onesie-toozy, probably they could get away with it.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   They're about to do it.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.000]   They've got a wholesale.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.640]   And I just, I have to, the only thing that's going to save them is that Congress and the
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.120]   federal government is completely clueless.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.000]   And by the time they catch on, and of course, these sociopaths don't believe it's going
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.240]   to happen.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   So by the time-
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.280]   This is where, but the problem here, Leo, is I asked Eric Schmidt about this at the
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   Ask When Ideas Festival this summer.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.000]   And what he said was the change isn't going to happen as fast as you want, Jarvis, because
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.560]   the resources of government in terms of money and regulation are favoring the incumbents.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.600]   Well, that's kind of what I was saying.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.360]   But I think that's disinformation that Eric Schmidt is handing you, Jeff Jarvis, because
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:26.040]   I think, I think Eric Schmidt knows exactly how quickly it's going to happen.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:31.000]   And his sole goal at this point is to stay as stealth as he can for as long as he can,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.400]   so that it will be too late by the time the vested interests come to this.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.640]   That's amazing about Gina's post this week, about 2009, and about our discussion.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.360]   What do you hear this has been?
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.720]   You start to add it up.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   It's awe inspiring.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.760]   Each one is rather stealthy, is rather small.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   Okay.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   So they did this, they did that.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.480]   Yeah, add it together, and it starts to show to me, maybe it's just my scales on my eyes,
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.760]   I start to see the strategy come into clearer focus.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   No, I'm with you.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.240]   And I think if you don't listen to this show, you may not become clear, but when you just
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:06.400]   from doing this show, and we've done 21 episodes, and I guess Gina, you knew all along, but
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:13.360]   it's become extremely clear that we are in, this has been a transformative year.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.200]   And is accelerating rapidly.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.400]   Is it was at your point?
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.640]   It's unbelievable when you look, yeah, I mean, when you look at what everything that Google
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.880]   has done in aggregate in 2009, it's really crazy.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.360]   And it's accelerating.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   It's made launches of the year.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.160]   It's happened faster in the last month.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   It's incredible.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.160]   Well, we're here.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.520]   At the end of the year, they were busier, it seemed in the beginning.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   Yes.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   Continue on.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.880]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.040]   No, no, that's okay.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.200]   I mean, the three big launches of the year, which from where I sat were, Wave, Chrome,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:58.880]   Chromium OS, and Android 2.0, were actually, for the regular consumer, not exactly earth
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   shattering.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.720]   A lot of people still aren't on Wave, and Chromium OS was just a demo.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.400]   I mean, that's not even out.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.840]   The Google experience release build isn't even out.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.080]   The Droid is still very, not very widely used.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.480]   And it's interesting to me, and I love it as a developer, that these are all open source
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.000]   products that are out earlier, that are out for developers to play with and for people
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.480]   to try out before the actual final release with the exception of Android, Chromium OS,
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.000]   and Wave are still really preview.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.120]   But I think that they lay this groundwork for the next few years that's going to be
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.760]   pretty incredible, pretty incredible stuff.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.520]   I mean, we're moving really entirely into the cloud, entirely into real time, entirely
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.920]   into having these powerful computers in our pocket that can do so many things on a fast
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   network.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:50.840]   I mean, this year was a big one, even though regular Joe Schmoe isn't going like, "Oh,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.280]   Google blew my mind this year."
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   Right.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.720]   No, Joe Schmoe has no idea.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:00.440]   No, except that's where I picked up what Gina was and tried to patch together the discussion
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.680]   we had last week, and I looked at it in two ways.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:09.200]   The first is Google getting closer and closer to intent on search, and that's why goggles
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   and visual search matter and voice search matters.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.960]   It's why the thing that last week amazed me, the search for whether in CH and you get the
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.760]   weather in the search box before you even ask the question, they give you the answer.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.480]   So that's one area, that's their core area, but then they've got to move past search.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:33.320]   Bitly, it grows by the minute because human links grow by the minute.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.240]   I'll get to my number of the week in a minute.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:42.440]   But then you look at mobile and local, and that's where I wrote this before the Yelp
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.640]   thing even came up to start to see where they get to the idea of knowing we're going to
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:55.120]   have a constantly connected device and all they can anticipate and give us in there.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.720]   And then as a result, target the hell out of us for advertising, and it's a beautiful
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.160]   thing for them.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:06.600]   Essentially, I think where we're headed is a heads up display somehow that basically,
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:12.040]   it's augmented reality that is at every moment giving you, I mean, we're very close to that.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.680]   Google's very close to a full time connection to Google and just look around you.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.200]   Google says, "What do you want to know about?"
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.080]   I could tell you anything you want to know about any of these things, and Wikipedia feeds
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.760]   into that.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   Where are you?
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   Who are you?
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   What are you doing now?
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.960]   Plus add in Google DNS and a Google OS so it really can know us as it goes along.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.120]   Are we sheep being led to the slaughter though?
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.520]   I mean, are we willing to Google give?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.320]   I mean, when it does this, it's this incredibly compelling offer.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.480]   And no one is going to say no.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.800]   Everyone is going to opt in.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:55.880]   And Google then becomes the arbiter of all information.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.360]   They become Skynet.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.360]   This is when you sound.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.720]   And by the time we realized there won't be any more yellow pages that we can fall back
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   on.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   It's too late.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:11.480]   That was interesting for me going to Paris because I'm so used to using my phone to tell
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   me where to go now.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   And it didn't work there.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   I've got to draw it.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   I could use it for Wi-Fi.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.120]   I couldn't use it anywhere else.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.880]   I was like, all right, there are these things in them called maps that I can look at to find
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   where I get to the destination.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.680]   I remember this from the 80s.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.520]   It was like a trip back in time for me.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.440]   Just on the walls of the metro, right?
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.000]   You go into the metro, there's a map.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.560]   And you get to the destination, there's a local map.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.080]   There's a system that's been there around 100 years that works.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.000]   But I'm so used to carrying this thing around it saying, "Turn left here."
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.600]   I think there's going to be an nostalgia movement, just as there is with vinyl records of people
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.240]   who want yellow pages and paper maps.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.800]   And they're going to be seen as very retro and bizarre.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.600]   They're going to-- we're at warding clothes.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.160]   It's a civil society of yellow pieces.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   It's just team punk, yes.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   It's crazy.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.320]   Oh, let me pull out my map.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.280]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.440]   Should we talk about the Twitter hack this weekend and security a little bit?
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   Yes, please do.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.640]   What happened?
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.560]   This is the Iranian thing?
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.440]   Yeah, the Iranian thing.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.600]   So the Twitter homepage, I think it was Friday night or Thursday night?
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   Thursday night was Thursday night.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.680]   I think for an hour, was it Thursday night?
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   For an hour was redirected to-- I forget what it's called.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:30.000]   It was called the Iranian cyber hacker squad or something.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.720]   That should not happen.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   That should not.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.640]   They should-- what the hell?
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.520]   I mean, after all, Twitter has been through.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.040]   You would think at this point.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.320]   But TechCrunch wrote up how it happened.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:47.280]   And basically, the attackers have been able to take over the email address that the Twitter
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.440]   had registered with their DNS service.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.480]   So they went and sent a password reset email and had gotten into the account.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.680]   And then just-- so it was just a DNS redirect.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.880]   So they didn't actually hack into the Twitter servers.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   They just said, this IP address should go down to RPA.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.880]   They said, we own Twitter.com.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.880]   They were able to--
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   Because they were able to--
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:09.280]   Who just, out of curiosity, did we know who the domain registrar was that was so
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.880]   blithely said, oh, Twitter's moved to Iran.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   I mean, what the hell--
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.520]   I think the service is called--
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.120]   Dine, D-I-N.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   I hadn't heard of it before.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   Dine DNS.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.120]   Dine DNS.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.760]   No, they-- you know what?
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   That's right.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   I think it's just--
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   Dine.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   It's the same company.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   It's on the same thing.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   Same company.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   Yes, it is.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.960]   Because we were talking about some security issues with Dine DNS.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.480]   And their parent company runs Twitter's servers.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.040]   I forgot about that.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.920]   But I mean, it really wasn't their fault because they-- I mean, they got into the account because
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   they sent the password.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.160]   You know, the Twitter's email address wasn't set up.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   No, I--
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   It's not the best word.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:56:00.560]   So they-- the December reminder to everyone is to double check your secondary email accounts.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.880]   Make sure that your password is secure, that your webmail accounts are all active, that
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.080]   one can just go set up-- reset up that hotmail account you used and send to Google
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   account password reset.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.560]   And by the way, Apple is not moving to Vladivostok.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.600]   So if you get any more mail saying Apple is moving to-- that's not true.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   Please.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.440]   You would think there'd be some sanity check, but I guess it maybe is fully automated.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   God, that's what it--
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Yeah, it seems that way.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   It does seem that way.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.520]   That's got to really hurt.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:42.080]   So I want to get to our tool tip and number of the week in just a bit before we do anything.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:49.240]   In that direction, anybody have another story that you want us to cover before we move on?
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   Going, going.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.120]   This was a great conversation, by the way.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.720]   Just fascinating conversation.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:57.560]   The other interesting Twitter one this week was the WordPress and Postgres implementing
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   the Twitter API.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.960]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.920]   I was interested to see what Gina thought of that one.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.280]   I love that idea because it disintermediates Twitter.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.520]   And this was Twitter as a Achilles heel, right?
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.680]   Because they have this great API.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.600]   And can you copyright an API?
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.480]   So actually, I missed the story.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   So what happened?
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.840]   They implemented the API so that you can make requests to the blogging services versus
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.400]   Twitter.com proper.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:27.480]   You can use your Twitter third party tools to post to Postgres or WordPress.com.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.680]   Just plain that to me.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.200]   Well it means that the API is published and well known.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.600]   Anybody could say, okay, just this happened with Blogger, Kevin, right?
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:43.120]   The Blogger API, the Blogger RPC became the defacto way to post to a blog.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.000]   And, you know, there's a bunch of us being going around saying we should come up with
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.640]   some standards for this stuff for a while.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.040]   This is the activity streams thing and all that stuff, right?
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   That's going okay.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.760]   But Twitter was like, oh, we like what we've done.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.040]   And so the others have now said, oh, well, if people are using your API, why don't we
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.040]   just clone it?
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.200]   So Matt and Coet WordPress did this first and the Postgres guys did it later in the week
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.720]   where you could now use some of the Twitter clients where you can actually set the end
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.120]   point to read and write to those as well.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   Why that's fantastic.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   Isn't that great?
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   Got it.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.200]   So it's emulating the Twitter API.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.840]   So that's interesting.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:25.000]   I'm not sure it's necessarily the best thing because the Twitter API isn't as rich as
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   all the other way.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.800]   It would be nice if we had a nice open API that was designed for this.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.520]   But that's what the winner was saying this week.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.920]   But it doesn't happen that way.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.440]   That doesn't happen that way.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   Our emergent and they come out often or standards are emergent and they come out of people behavior.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.440]   And somebody says, good idea.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   I'll do that too.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   And boom, you're all there.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   Right.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   Unfortunately, that's.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   To some extent.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.960]   I mean, you know, there are standards that are designed as well.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.360]   But the good ones are based on practice.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.400]   The bad ones are made up from scratch by somebody in a, you know, in a.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.280]   In ivory tower somewhere somewhere in Massachusetts.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.120]   And the good ones tend to be put together by, oh, we're doing this thing.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.880]   Why don't we get together and see if we can agree it?
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.280]   If you look at our author and those standards, they come through that process.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.120]   So it's interesting to see.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.600]   And it was, you know, I've been, as someone who's been poking the Twitter guys about,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.960]   it would be nice if you came to more standards meetings.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.560]   This is an interesting twist on that.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.200]   They kind of won.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.240]   What's, what's wrong with the Twitter API?
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.000]   Nothing, but nothing's wrong for its purpose for Twitter.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.960]   It doesn't actually is, it's like my analogy is the difference between a t-shirt and a
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   suit.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.520]   If the Twitter API is like, you know, like the Facebook API is really well fitted for the
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.440]   purpose there.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:43.600]   What you need for a general case is something that's likely looser fitting that will map
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.920]   to more places.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:50.240]   So, you know, the Twitter API isn't a perfect fit for a blog, but it's similar enough that
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.400]   you can make it work.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.680]   But you'll find that something, you know, some things don't quite make sense in that
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.840]   world because you have to map.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.800]   So if I'm retweeting, what does that mean?
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.120]   With Postrus, it means I'm reblogging with WordPress, not clear what it means.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.480]   If I'm, if I'm replying, is that a comment on the blog or is that a post to my own blog?
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.360]   The mapping isn't perfectly exact and you've got to decide what it means.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.120]   But it's close enough that you can do it.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:19.440]   But then Kevin, isn't the sense, isn't the old mapping of the blog world what's the suit
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.000]   and limited when you put it that way?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.600]   Well, you know, Twitter was a blog service to begin with.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   Sure.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   You could argue that.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.400]   Well, the point is, you know, what you can do.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.800]   Yeah, you could argue that, but if Twitter is not going to implement that.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   Right.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800]   Just let it happen.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.720]   If Twitter, you know, if, to give an example, Twitter won't do enclosures.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.720]   This is, you know, Dave Winers, crusade for Twitter.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.280]   Give me a way to attach MP3 files to Twitter.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.240]   The blogs have ways of doing that.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.080]   So how do we do that now?
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.880]   Well, we'd have to work out a mapping that sort of degrades down to something that works
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.160]   with Twitter to post it as a link.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.280]   And then we have to reverse the short link and decide it's an MP3 and do a whole bunch
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.640]   of extra code to deal with that.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.040]   Isn't that what Twitpick does?
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.960]   You know it's a brand and the clients tend to know that it's a photo and displays the
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.520]   photo in the client.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   Right.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.840]   But it has to, but it knows it's Twitpick.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.640]   It doesn't, you know, some of them work with Flickr.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Some of them don't.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   Some of them work with YFrog.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   Some of them don't.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.240]   For each URL, you actually have to go there and sit there and fetch it and then sniff it
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.000]   and say, was that a JPEG?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.400]   Was that a page that contains a JPEG?
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   How do I know if this is a photo?
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.600]   Or you know that the URL always has JPEGs.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.960]   So Dave Weiner tomorrow could start and you, oh, oh, oh, oh, fathers of podcasting, would
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.880]   start a new enclosure brand tomorrow.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   Right.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.840]   And you don't have to go and talk to every client and say, by the way, you know, Kevin
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   Davis.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.040]   Kevin Davis photo.com is a photo service.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.440]   But that's the beautiful thing about the client world is the client, it's like a federation
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.400]   because the clients are keeping up on this.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   But it's a weak way to do it.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   You're going to have a hundred of these.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   You know, compared to both.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   Well, yes, it is.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   Yes, it is.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   There's an image.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.040]   It's a fairly clunky way of doing it.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.120]   But I also can see it's a world where you throw out a feature and if there's critical
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.400]   mass behind it, it will get adoption if there isn't.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400]   It won't.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   Sure.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.560]   And it's not unlike, you know, the fact that a hashtag became a hashtag only because it
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.320]   being critical mass.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.080]   So I kind of like that emergent sense of it rather than the committee sense of it.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.760]   But technology has to hate it because it's so disorderly.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   That's why I like it.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.400]   I like to make them nervous and in congestion.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.720]   You're making Kevin very nervous.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   I can.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   I know why.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.080]   I've been advocating for a empirical standards, you know, that's, that's, you know, what
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.760]   we do is we say, okay, clearly six of us are trying to do something that's really similar
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760]   here.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760]   How about we agree on how to do it rather than doing it.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   Right.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   Eventually you want a standard.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.800]   You don't want it all ad hoc because it's just that.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   That's crazy.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.440]   But, but then you don't have to sort of do it through business ratios because you can
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440]   do it through reading the spec.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440]   And that's the thing that helps in the end.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440]   Right.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.280]   Gina, you worked with this, with this API.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.680]   I have and, and you know, I have a whole block of code that says, is this, if this is twit
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.600]   pick.com do this, if this is why I frog do this.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.560]   So I mean, you know, if someone, if a leader came out and said, okay, I'm going to publish,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.800]   you know, an XML file and keep it updated of all the, you know, mapping the, you know,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.640]   what photo services to their method calls.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.360]   And then so my client has to query that every time.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   That's cool.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.200]   But I would rather, I'd rather it was just an enclosure standard.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   Right.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.760]   So this is, this is kind of a meta.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760]   Sorry.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.000]   Isn't that kind of a better DNS then?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.840]   That's what it would be.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.440]   It's just that, you know, and then if someone long, you know, Kevin launches his photo service,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.600]   he has to let the intermediary, you know, organization know they have to update and
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.440]   then my client has to, but then like my clients making all these other and it's complicated.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.480]   It's a more complex way to do it than if you just, you know, supported enclosures in
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   the standard.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.600]   But that being said, if the Twitter API has been implemented in a wide number of really
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.640]   great clients on a lot of different platforms.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.800]   So the fact that you can post to other services using it means that if all the clients make
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.560]   configurable endpoints, meaning that you can say, Hey, when I post a status update, you
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.960]   know, post it to my blog here, post it to Twitter here, post it to these rest, the rest
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   of these places, it's great for everyone.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.320]   It's great for developers because you don't have to rewrite code.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:14.360]   It's great for users because you can access, you know, many platforms from one single
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.720]   interface and it's great for the clients because suddenly they become multi tools and
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.280]   they're not just Twitter tools.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.080]   So I'll explain this to me.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.540]   If that happens and if I used the Twitter API to never update Twitter to only update
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.080]   WordPress, which I could do, right?
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.640]   Then what control does Twitter still have over the API?
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.560]   If everybody agrees to an enclosure and Twitter doesn't do it, but everybody else is doing
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   it.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.520]   So if everyone also agrees to enclosures and Twitter doesn't, that means that your client
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:50.240]   should be able to do those, have that extra feature if you're just posting to your blog
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.160]   and not Twitter and Twitter wouldn't.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.160]   So no, I mean, Twitter wouldn't be able to, wouldn't have any control over that.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.080]   I don't believe that you can trademark method calls and interfaces.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.200]   I don't think that you can copyright an API, although I'm not positive.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.160]   But I'm pretty sure that you could say we support the Twitter API plus all this other
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.880]   stuff as well.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:17.520]   I'm not sure that they wouldn't necessarily have to dislike it, but if they did, is there
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.040]   any way they could torpedo it?
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   I don't believe so.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   I don't think so.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   But I'm not.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.240]   Well, there's a real risk there.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.280]   If you change the API out from under stuff like this, there's the real risk that you'll
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.160]   leave behind all the people who are running to the API.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.720]   You can't, you can't just kind of say, Oh, we're going to, that's deprecated.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.280]   Well, you would overload the API versus change it, right?
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.200]   So you would all message should work, you know, and match and parallel Twitter, but you'd
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.080]   overload them for the other services that can do the extra stuff and Twitter just couldn't
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   do that.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   So that's how you'd have to handle it, really.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.240]   So if you're Twitter, go the other way.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:55.080]   If Twitter is smart and they are, how do they take advantage of this?
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   There's no defense.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   There's no defense.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:02.600]   So do they, do they convene committees to agree to all these other things that even they
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   never thought of?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.800]   Well, these, there's a way that they can embrace this.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:12.800]   Well, potentially, but they'd have to, you know, basically set up a say, and they've
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.440]   already got a discussion forum for we want new things in our API, can you add them?
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.320]   So they could make that less of a please up, please do this for me, Twitter, you know,
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.880]   the Microsoft approach to APIs and make it more like an open source model where people
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.360]   can submit patches and things.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.520]   And they'd have that would change for them.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.600]   Yeah, I mean, if the most popular Twitter client supports enclosures and lots of people
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:44.560]   using it to post to their blog, I think that's a very compelling reason for Twitter to consider
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.280]   that addition to the API versus, you know, a couple of forum posts on people saying,
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.440]   hey, we'd really like to do this.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.880]   But isn't that what's happening already with Twitpick and WiFrog and all of these?
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.680]   It's de facto enclosures.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.280]   They operate differently with it.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.200]   All right, I specialize in ignorant questions.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:08.400]   So is there an open source API, there are open source code bases, but is there an open
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.920]   source API like what you just described coming up?
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.600]   OpenSocial was a good example.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.360]   OpenSocial has an API that's designed for a whole bunch of different social networks
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:22.240]   to do this kind of thing and includes, you know, identity.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.680]   It includes activity streams and a few bits and pieces like that.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.960]   And the way changes happen to it is people propose them to the standards group, they
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:34.200]   debate it and then they issue a new version of the standard with code.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.160]   And that's, you know, the IETF is an organization that's built on this model, right?
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.880]   The IETF that does the internet standards is designed to let you create new standards
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.720]   by reference to old standards and you debate them and you create interoperating implementations
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.360]   and post them to that and extend them over time.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.280]   So there is history here.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.200]   The difference here could be that Twitter could become that body.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.080]   If Twitter embraced this, they would become like the IETF and say, okay, we're going to
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.880]   help everybody do this in a more sane way.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.080]   They could do that.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.800]   Over everybody else's dead body.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   Right.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.880]   No, I mean, the IETF is, yeah, I mean, it, yeah, standards committee is by definition
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.920]   not a single corporate interest, right?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.120]   I mean, it wouldn't be.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]   It wouldn't be the same.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.400]   So the other thing with the organization was set up to try and make it easier for people
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.600]   to do this kind of thing.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.360]   What we've seen over the last couple of years is that the new standards and I'm having to
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:40.080]   set up some governing book that you can agree to changes to it and deal with.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.880]   And the point of the Open Web Foundation was to provide a template so people could do
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   that.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   So that would be one answer.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   Okay.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.680]   We, it is zero from Web Foundation template.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.880]   We administer this.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.440]   But it still, you know, it still comes out of having the world to say, yes, we're handing
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.400]   over control of this to a third body.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   We're not going to wait it ourselves.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.200]   And that's, that's, that's difficult thing to do.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   Okay.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.000]   I'm delaying my own pizza, but one more question.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   You are.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   You delay my pizza now.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Go ahead.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   Sorry.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.520]   So the fact that, you know, two things happen this week, Google announced its own URL shortening
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.520]   service.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.080]   Meanwhile, Bitly came out with a pro version and also some neat stuff like Bitly video
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.960]   where they can tear apart the URLs and find out what the most popular videos are.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.800]   So does the shortening service become kind of a parallel API to all this?
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.360]   And you find different features with different shortening services.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.680]   And what happens if people use Google's versus Bitly's or the New York Times's or Bitly's
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680]   private label ones?
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.400]   Does that complicate our world again too?
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.440]   Or am I just being dumb?
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.400]   No, it does complicate things, right?
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.760]   Because like, because some photo services, for example, I think like tweet photo lets
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.240]   you do things that maybe YFrog doesn't let you do like comment or star or have friends.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.120]   And so Bitly offers statistics on clicks that maybe, you know, other shortening services
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   don't, right?
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.160]   So, and that's part of the reason why some people like to use some over the others.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.600]   I like Bitly because it gives me stats.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.240]   I'm not even really sure if Google's new shortening services service does that.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.400]   So, so, no, it complicates things, right?
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.120]   Because then it becomes, is the stats and the extra stuff that you can do with the shortening
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.200]   or with the enclosure?
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.640]   Is that part of the API as well?
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.440]   I mean, is it, you know, in order to be a shortener or an image host for Twitter, do
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.880]   you have to support, you know, should you support these extra things?
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.720]   It's, you know, it's a good question.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.400]   Everyone's kind of overloading things.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.240]   Did you sign up for pro?
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.600]   The Bitly pro, did you sign up for that?
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.640]   I have not, I have not yet, but I very well may.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.760]   Yeah, a lot of people try that yet.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.000]   Is it fantastic?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   That's my asking you.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   I don't know.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   What is it?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.480]   Bitly, do you do it because you make your own.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.880]   It becomes a private label service, right?
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   Right.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Sure.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   You make it.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880]   So I have it slash whatever.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.640]   I tried to get T W dot I T, but you have to be Italian, unfortunately.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:01.000]   Ah, that's, I don't think I wonder, by the way, all these two tin horn dictators that
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.160]   own these suffixes, if one of them pulled out, if I don't know where dot L Y is, Libya,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   don't you love Libya?
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   Hey, hello, cut off.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.360]   We've just, you know, put our necks on the line with Libya.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.000]   You're and they can pull out and they can hold us up now and say, all that data you have
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.880]   is now useless.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   That's interesting.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   They could take it.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   They could do the thing.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   That's a good point.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.360]   I think that happened to Twitter by, by, by, by fiat because of the government.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   Right.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   It's true.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   We owned that.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.120]   Anyway, I want every bit of the URL to Gaddafi fan page.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.360]   Oh, that would be dastardly.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.360]   Dastardly.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.240]   Not that I want to give anybody any ideas.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.400]   Sorry.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400]   Once again.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.240]   All right, we're going to, we're going to take a break, come back.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.760]   Two believe you down.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.240]   T when Tuvalu sings, what are we going to do?
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.880]   There'll be no dot TV.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.120]   Then I'm in trouble.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.120]   We're going to take a break, come back in just a bit with your tip of the week.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.240]   Gina, true, Gina, Trapani, your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis, and I have a tool of
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240]   the weekend.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.880]   We'll just let you say anything you want, Kevin Marks, anything at all.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   I have to think of something.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.560]   I think of something clever to say.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.000]   It could be, what about your epigram of the week?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.360]   I think that's what Kevin should have an epigram.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.920]   It's your gram of the week.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.360]   Well, you have a minute.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.240]   I'm going to talk about that one.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.240]   Start spinning.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.000]   But first, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, about my great Ford Sync.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.600]   I think this is absolutely a transformational technology in cars.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.800]   And in fact, I understand some major announcements coming from Ford at CES.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.360]   We'll be there and we will cover it.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:40.880]   Ford Sync is the hands-free Bluetooth phone capability in all Ford, Lincoln and New Ford,
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.800]   But it's more than that because it's also a way that you control your media player.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.000]   When my iPhone is connected, it starts playing back audio from the Bluetooth.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.400]   I can listen to music.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.920]   If I connect it up via USB because every Ford Sync vehicle has a USB port, you can then
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.560]   index all the stuff on your Ford Sync and you could say, "Play this week in Google episode
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.760]   21," and it starts playing.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.080]   You can say, "Play the Beatles, you can play next, play previous, play similar."
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.000]   It is just incredible.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.880]   And I have a feeling that we're going to see some very interesting developments.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.560]   I think Ford Sync is the iPhone of car computers.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   I want you to try it.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]   You can do a couple of things.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.000]   Go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com for a tour of what Ford Sync can do and to learn more about
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   it.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.120]   Or just go to your local Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealer.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.720]   You don't have to say, "I want to drive the car."
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.880]   Say, "I'd like to test drive the Sync."
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.320]   See what they say.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.120]   Ford Sync, it is incredible.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.680]   If you're in the market for a new auto, I highly encourage you to take a look at Ford,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.200]   Lincoln and Mercury vehicles just for the Sync alone.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:44.760]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com is the URL.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.400]   Gina Trapani, it's time for your Tip of the Week.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400]   My dear.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.960]   I sound like W.C. feels like my dear.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.640]   It's your Tip of the Week.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   This week, Google launched a useful little addition to your Gmail contacts list, which
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.320]   is your contacts for your entire Google account.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.360]   If you go into your contacts, there's now a new button that says, "Find duplicates."
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   How I'll load you.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.080]   It will do just that.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.840]   It'll show you names that appear twice.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.360]   If you have a friend who emails you from one address and then emails you from another
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.440]   address later, that person appears twice in your contacts.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.120]   But you hit that "Find duplicates" button.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.240]   It will show you a list of the names that appear to be dupes.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.680]   And then you can, in one shot, you can check off the ones that are indeed dupes and hit
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.880]   a merge button.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.480]   And it'll just merge them all together and clean up your contacts list in one shot.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   Much needed.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.800]   Does it do a good job?
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.800]   It does a great job.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.600]   It shrunk my contacts list by like 50 people who I had doubles of.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   Hallelujah.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.280]   Well, you get doubles also because of Gmail copying addresses of people you send mail
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.880]   to and not knowing that it's in that contact and so you get all these extra little...
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.720]   I look forward to that.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720]   That's great.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720]   I will try it immediately.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720]   Jeff Jones.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720]   Would you tap the ship that?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   Pardon me?
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   Really grab that ship that I remember.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.520]   They were building that when I was there.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.800]   So it has been coming for a while.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800]   So that's good.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.720]   Anytime you have synchronization, you've got to have deduplification.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720]   Yes.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   Is that a word?
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   Jeff.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   I think so.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720]   It made sense to us, but no one knew it.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   In my world, it definitely is.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.640]   It only goes a "f" in there.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.440]   But anyway, deduplification sounds right somehow.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.280]   Jeff Jarvis, what's your number of the week?
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   Two billion.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   Two billion.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.080]   I've been crowing about how Google News does one billion clicks a month and Bitly had
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.080]   matched that.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.960]   Well, now Bitly has doubled that and the Bitly blog says that there are now a two billion
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   clicks a month.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   Huminy.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.960]   Cost.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.120]   Which is awe inspiring and amazing, but it also I think does raise the concern that
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.080]   we spoke about a minute ago is that we've lost the transparency of addresses on the
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.400]   web.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.680]   And so it's very hard for us to gather around addresses and find the heat.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.640]   And there are intermediaries who now have to go to decode addresses again.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.800]   It becomes, as we said a minute ago, in another context, a kind of shadow meta DNS.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.520]   And in a way that's troubling, I think, that we've made addresses opaque again.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:15.160]   Nonetheless, give credit to Bitly and also note, I think, the importance of this.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.960]   But if you add up Bitly plus all its competitors, you have the growth of the human link and
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:27.400]   the power of the human link again versus just the search and the algorithmic means of discovery.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   Amazing.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.760]   Bitly, I think, is an amazing service.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.400]   I have to say, I'm really looking forward to trying these things.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   I don't care what more.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.960]   I'm our Gaddafi once.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.760]   Now, this actually ties very well into I'm going to do two tools because one, of course,
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:48.240]   is the one Gina mentioned, that he's Google shortening, GOO.GL.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.680]   And I don't know who runs Greenland, but we can hope that they will be a benign superpower
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.120]   protecting us with our shorten links via Google.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   That doesn't seem like it has a whole lot of features.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120]   There's no Bitly.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.280]   Let's put it that way.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.600]   But I wouldn't put the guys in Mountain View out of the picture.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.760]   I'm sure at some point it will have a lot of features.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.640]   And certainly there's a pretty clear roadmap of where you go with a URL shortening.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.200]   Let's start the URL right now that Google's going to buy Bitly.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200]   It's not true.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200]   I know nothing.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   But what the hell?
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   Let's make a rumor.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   That's how Mike works.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.200]   That's fine.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   GOO.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   GOO.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.680]   GOO.GL.G.L. and there is a Chrome extension if you want to do it automatically in there.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.760]   I really don't know why anybody would, to be honest, would use this as opposed to Bitly,
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.280]   but there's a reason.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.640]   There's certainly a reason why Google is doing it.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:44.040]   They say the core goals of the service are stability, security, and speed.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.560]   And I think I'd have to have it out of the fourth Greenland.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.240]   Also, this is the tool I was going to start with is Google browser size.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.080]   This is kind of an oddball tool.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.200]   But it's bizarre.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:04.360]   You can see how much of your page as a web designer, people can see.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.600]   I think that's such a stupid tool.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   Can I run about this for me?
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   Yes, please.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:18.000]   First of all, if my screen's only that wide, the layout changes because I've done my page
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   properly.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.360]   Secondly, my little screen's zooming in and out now.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.560]   And thirdly, guess what?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560]   People scroll.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.720]   This hole above the fold crap.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   It's kind of antiquated.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.320]   And it's the people actually scroll down and look at stuff.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.680]   I just think it looks cool.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.760]   It looks cool, but it's propagating the wrong thing.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:48.400]   It's one of those great informatics that makes you really think you're learning something.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.880]   When in fact, you're learning nothing at all.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.240]   People don't read the top inch because they expect the banner ad to be there.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.000]   You put stuff in that top inch.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Nobody sees it.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.520]   Because they look down an inch below it.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.520]   There's a whole science of eye tracking here.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.200]   There's a whole set of actually observing people's behavior and what they do.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.560]   And this is doing this in the crudest, stupid way possible.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.520]   I expect better f***ing people, really.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.440]   Did you guys see there is no pagefold.com?
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.640]   Which I think lasts on the same day.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.960]   Now, how he said that he loved the irony.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   I love it.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.760]   There is no pagefold.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   This is the internet.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.720]   The whole notion of home pages goes away.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.600]   The notion of the home page is just silly.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.560]   That's where you package the world and most traffic doesn't come in through the home page.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.640]   And so I say there should be no home pages.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   Welcome to the World Wide Web, an interactive medium in which screen resolution statistics
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.820]   are trivial.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:47.320]   Browser view reports are variable and scrolling behavior is a standard.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   Keep going.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   Go down.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   Go down.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   Go down.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320]   Go down.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.240]   There is no pagefold.
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.240]   There's more.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240]   Keep going.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240]   Keep going.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.240]   Go all the way to the bottom.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.000]   You can tell because you get a little scrolling.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.800]   Love your scroll bar.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:09.200]   Okay, so my tool sucked, but it did give us a great conversation.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.600]   And that's all I really care about.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.280]   It's been really good having you all on.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.200]   Kevin Marks, thanks for joining us.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.200]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.200]   Way to be back.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.920]   Of course, Kevin's blog is apayus.blogspot.com.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.240]   Is there anywhere else you'd like to plug anything else you'd like to let us know about?
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.520]   Oh, I think you look at RIBB mobile.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520]   I think that's interesting.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   RIBB, yeah.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.440]   R-I-B-B-I-T mobile from a service of British Telecom.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.160]   And is it just for Wave or is it for anybody?
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.440]   No, no, no.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.880]   This is a service.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.120]   It transcribes it well and sends it to business.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.840]   Okay, and I hope that whatever he said will come to me as an S&S soon.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.400]   Got some clever stuff.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   Good.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   RIBB-I-T.com.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.000]   It's great to talk to you.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.080]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is always available at BuzzMachine.com.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.840]   His great blog, which is a must read, is one of the best bloggers out there.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.240]   I really enjoy it.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:18.480]   Don't forget the book, "What Google Do in Edition 29 or whatever it is."
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   How many editions?
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.480]   How many?
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:21.480]   We have 11 printings.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.480]   11 printings.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   Amazing.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.960]   Gina Travani's blog is smarterwhere.org.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:33.560]   She's also the author of "The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com."
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.160]   And she's in the snowstorm now.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   Yes, sir.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.760]   So she will never come back to San Diego again.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.600]   She's buried in avalanche.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.760]   Not at least thoughtful next year.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.160]   You and Jeff stay warm and enjoy your holidays.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:52.040]   We will be back here on Boxing Day if you guys wish to continue to do a show the day
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040]   after Christmas.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   Yep, for it.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.040]   I'm up for it.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.040]   Okay.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040]   I'm hoping I get back in time.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   Yep.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.960]   If not, we'll postpone, but I think it'd be fun to do it.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.520]   And then the day after New Year's, we'll have our first show of 2010.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.260]   As I mentioned, you can see us now on YouTube, which is greatnews.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.720]   YouTube.com/twit.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.480]   We can also, we also have video versions available at Twit.tv and soon to be on iTunes as well.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.160]   And on the Roku box and lots of other places too.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   Watch the show and video.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.760]   You can see how silly we all look.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   I'm Leo LaPoule.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.280]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
