[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff and Stacey are here and we have lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.920]   Why did Facebook give local news $100 million? What's going on with the weather business and
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   the sad story of an astrophysicist and some very powerful magnets? Don't try this at home.

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hey Stacey is going to be on a ask me anything this Friday. We've been doing these with this
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320]   our third one. It's kind of fun just a way to get together on Fridays. I won't be part of this one
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.760]   because I did the last two but this week is Florence Aion from all about AndrÃ©ed Renee Richie from
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.120]   Macbreak Weekly. Paul Therot from Windows Weekly and our very own Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.520]   1130 a.m. Pacific Friday April 3rd. You can join us. Ask me anything. The stream is at twitt.tv/live.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.560]   You can ask on Twitter. You can ask in our chatroom. Stacey you're going to have a lot of fun. It's
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.080]   a really fun relaxed couple hours talking about you know whatever and then I think next week
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440]   we're going to start doing game night. We're working on the details of that. We'll probably move the
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   AMA from 1130 but we might still do it but we're going to do game night I think 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.680]   Pacific that'll be 8 to 10 p.m. Eastern starting a week from Friday. That's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.000]   I am definitely playing in that one. It's time for twig this week in Google or as somebody said
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   we should call it Google Gaga. The show where we cover everything having to do with Google,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.640]   Facebook, Twitter, the media verse, all of the verses. Stacey Higginbotham is here. Stacey
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.720]   on IOT.com she does the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel and we love having you on and she's
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.560]   I mean you look chilly. You look chilly. You're wearing down. Oh it was super cold today. I mean
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.320]   it's like 36 degrees. It hailed yesterday. Spring has been interesting. Locusts are coming next.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   Yes. My daughter is very upset about the Locust Jeff. There are Locusts in Africa.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.840]   Oh but they had them in didn't they have a grasshopper infestation in Las Vegas? I think they did.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   There were those goats taking over a Welsh town have you seen that video? Oh it's the greatest.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   A whole herd of goats just took over the town and every night they're there and they're just
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.680]   eating the bushes and having a high old time. Nobody to bother them.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.200]   So it's related to the coronavirus? Yeah. There's nobody on the streets. That's Jeff Jarvis,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   professor of journalism at Goats. An old goat. And an old goat with me. He is of course at
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.880]   buzzmachine.com. He's also at the City University of New York. The town night.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.480]   Craig Newmark. Craig Newmark. School for entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.400]   First first. How are you guys doing? How are you doing? Good. That's good. I think we should
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.240]   start a show like that. How are you doing Stacy? I'm you know I chant Jason Howell was so helpful
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.120]   when I was anxious. So you already know this is going to be bad because I'm like bring it anxious.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   But today I woke up and I was feeling pretty anxious and I'm chanting Jason Howell's
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   anxiety is a wave. You just got to write it. So I am a little down today.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   But I am glad to be here with y'all. And I someone actually said that they found the show
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.840]   helpful. And they said me a DM telling me that. Oh thank you. So for that person I'm like hey I
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.800]   might be doing something good. So you know that actually got me out of it. Not got me out of bed
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.760]   this morning but it makes me feel good sitting here. So I think both your shows. I think
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   podcasts in particular right now are I think valuable because we're the people if you've been
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   listening to our shows who've been with y'all along and now we're all in together. I think that
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   that's that's certainly my goal. Jeff how are you? How are you doing? I kind of melted yesterday.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.000]   I wrote about this last night. I think the 9-- it was 9/11.19 is the name of the post,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.560]   COVID-19-9/11 and it-- the death toll passing 9/11 just kind of brought back the PTSD of
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   that.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.520]   Well, and you're in New Jersey. You're in New Jersey in your home, but you work in times
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.560]   just going--
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.520]   That city is my work.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.440]   And it hurts to see my city brought down again.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   And to see the pictures of-- and it's on the 9/11 site.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.880]   The whale terminal, the train station that you go into, when you come into town, empty.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.080]   Was-- I mean, wow. I mean, just empty.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   But it's a day on--
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.680]   I always wanted to drive into the city just to drive around, but I think that would probably
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   depress me.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   That'll make you-- that'll make you sad.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   It'll feel like a Charlton-Heston Planet of the Apes movie.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   Like, "You damn dirty apes! You did it!"
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   But of course, we did it. We did it towards--
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   And just, it won't be totally empty because there are still people running around and then
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.680]   you'll get angry.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.680]   Yeah. Yes, that's true too.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   That's true too.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   I asked Mary Jo because--
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   I think you should meditate and stay home.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   Mary Jo Foley has an apartment. It's roughly Midtown, I think.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   And I said, "Do you walk around?" Because I'm fascinated by the pictures of the empty streets
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   in Manhattan.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   I thought it'd be kind of cool to walk around.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.680]   You can't really walk around with it and preserve social distancing.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   There's still too many people out in the streets.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   But--
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   And the sidewalks themselves, you know, you're not going to walk in the middle of the streets.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   It's not that deserted.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   If you could walk down the middle of the street, maybe.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.680]   The other thing I--
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   It's trying to find a lot of stuff on the Upper East Side and said that he just put on Facebook.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   Pro-talk for walking the dog.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680]   Go the wrong way on a one-way street.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   The middle of the street because it's hardly any cars.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   Then you can get out of the way.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   Right.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   It's people who are trying to figure out how to do this.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   Right.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.680]   So how are you, boss?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   Oh, I'm-- you know, my--
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   The funny thing is, my routine is pretty much the same as it was before.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   We're doing this out of a little bit different studio, but I'm still--
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'm glad I decided to come to work A because I do better psychologically if I'm out of the house.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.680]   Poor Lisa is in the house.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   And it's really hard for her.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   She's just sitting at the kitchen table all day.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   Working.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   Working.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   And so one of the reasons I come here is to get out of her hair.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   And then-- but also by coming in, I eliminate the need for another technical director.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   So we're trying to keep the staff requirements as low as possible.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   And because I'm working in my own office, nobody else here, and I'm switching myself, I feel relatively safe.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   It's psychologically difficult, but not-- I don't feel like I've been too challenged yet.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   I'm worried as this goes on, and I think we have at least another once.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680]   At least.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.680]   Cuomo said today that we'll hit the peak in the model, most of the average of the models at the end, the peak.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   So it means we still got a long way to go down from there at the end of April in New York, and it's going to hit other parts of the country later.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   Do you think the San Francisco really did--
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   Yeah, I think--
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680]   --think of--
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   --manage it?
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   And again, it's hard to tell because we don't test.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   But that Kinsa thermometer that I showed you, the internet-connected thermometer, and there are millions of them out there.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   You can look at a county by county breakdown, and they're not measuring COVID.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   That's one of the benefits of this.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   They're merely measuring temperatures.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   But they have what is considered normal this time of year based on flu and other infections.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   And they have what's-- for a while San Francisco is trending just above normal, and then you can see where shelter in place started.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   And it is now well below normal in terms of--
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   Because they're so damn chill in San Francisco.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   Well, no, but just because there's no-- you're not also not getting the flu.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   You're not getting other illnesses.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   Yeah, you're just-- when you're home, you're home.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   It's-- I will say--
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   So I think that that's happened in this area, although our cases and numbers are going up.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   But where are numbers?
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.680]   You know, Sonoma County, where we are, it's like 44 people have it.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   One death.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   Wow.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   I mean, it's very small numbers.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   No, I was going to say Seattle seems to be-- we social distanced earlier.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   And apparently, we're never social to begin with.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   So we're doing-- I am gratified that our numbers seem to be-- our increase in numbers seem to be leveling off.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   So--
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   You were the first hot spot.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   You were the first hot spot.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   We were.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   But man, New York is-- I think of you a lot, Jeff.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   I'm very concerned for you.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   Thank you.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   So--
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.680]   Well, I saw on map today that was interesting.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   And there's many interpretations.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   But if you look at the spots in New York City by zip code, one theory is that it's people who have to travel the farthest way on the subway.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   Another theory is that it's the lower income spots.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.680]   But you can see where the Queens is the hot spot and the hot spot.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   And the big fear here is how-- I'm so lucky as hell.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   I'm out here in the burbs.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   I got, you know, grass and trees around me.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   That's what I'm-- so I've got social distancing, thanks to nature around me.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   I'm very lucky.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   I'm fortunate.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   But people in New York who have to go to work still.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   Yeah, that's hard.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   The-- I think some of us think, oh, well, how am I doing?
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   And because my situation like mine-- and really kind of yours too, because we're all-- you know, we're kind of working home.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   Isn't so different.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   Yours may be Jeff, because you don't go into class.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   But there's more to it than that.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   And I think this is what's going to start to hit us.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   It's what's happening in New York as we see those images and we see those numbers.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   And there was an article in the Harvard Business Review.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   I've not referred to it before.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   You've probably seen it by Scott Barranato.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   That discomfort you're feeling is grief.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:24.680]   They talk to a guy named David Kessler, who is the world's, they say, foremost expert on grief.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   Co wrote a book with Elizabeth Kubler Ross on grief and grieving.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   And his latest book adds, you know, the five stages that Kubler Ross talked about of grief.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   He added a sixth stage, which is finding meaning.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   And I have to say, having gone through something very slightly similar in San Francisco in the '80s with the AIDS epidemic,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   that was one thing that AIDS activists told me, was that it was also as horrible as it was,
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   there was meaning at the end of it, and that there was learning at the end of it,
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   and that the community going through that suffering got something out of it.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.680]   The Kessler has founded a site called grief.com, and in the interview, he said, we're all, we're feeling grief,
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   and some of his anticipatory grief as a country and even as a world about what's happening,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   about the people who are dying about the illnesses that are happening.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   And that resonated with me.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   I don't know if that's how you guys feel too, but that kind of explained why I have this kind of lump in my stomach all the time.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.680]   It's whoa.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   Yeah, that's...
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   It is.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   I was complaining earlier about having my chest be constantly tight,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   and I think part of that is I just constantly feel like I'm about to cry.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   But I can't quite cry because it doesn't feel good.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   It's a whole...
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.680]   It's a whole bunch of what I wrote last night is I just realized this is 9/11 in slow motion.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   And worse than the way...
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   You were at 9/11, you were in it.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   I was there and I made decisions, some bad, like staying there.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   And now I feel like, you know, if I'd gone a few feet one way or the other, I wouldn't be here now.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.680]   As the tower came down.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   So you have PTSD.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   You have a severe...
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   Well, I actually got diagnosed with it recently.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   That fell view of all places.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   And it was attenuated, but now I know what's happening.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   It's coming back.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.480]   And every decision you make, you touch that door knob, you go to that grocery store, you
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680]   take in the mail and don't wash your hands.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   It's like I had a promo for you yesterday.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   Oh, God, I just did it.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   And it's not just me, it's my family and my community.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   And so that's with us constantly.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   There's a responsibility and uncertainty, a powerlessness.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   And do you part of meaning, Leo?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   We can get things out of this if we try.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   We can get caring for our healthcare system.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   We can get caring for communities that aren't being cared for.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   We can figure out how to be better connected with the world and share more.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   Or we'll screw it up.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   We'll see.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   We have, you know, as a society gone through the stages of grief, there was denial.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   It's genuine.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   There was a lot of denial.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   There was anger.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   There still is for a lot of people.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   There's anger at the government for not acting fast enough or anger at authorities for saying,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.680]   "You're making me stay home.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   I don't want to stay home."
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   There's bargaining like, "Hey, if I do this for two weeks, can I go out next week?"
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   There's sadness.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   There's acceptance.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.680]   There's meaning.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   He also talks about, those are the traditional stages, the kubler-rust stages of grief.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   But he also talks about anticipatory grief, which is more like the anxiety that you were
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   feeling, Stacy.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   He says, "Our minds begin to show us images.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   My parents getting sick.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   We see the worst scenarios.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   That's our minds being protective.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   Our goal is not to ignore those images.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   Don't try to make them go away.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   Your mind won't let you do that.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   It's painful to try to force it.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   The goal is to find balance in the things you're thinking.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   If you think, if you feel the worst image taking shape, make yourself think of the best image.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   I think that's why it's nice to think that maybe our society will come through this wiser,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   maybe even more equitable.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   I think we should be starting to talk.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   In Kevin and I, we introduced a segment on our show.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   This is the tomorrow show, "Be the Second One," where we talk about what we want the world
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   to look like at.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   Perfect.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   The first one, oh, now I don't even remember.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   We talked about privacy and medical devices.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   The second one, we talked about broadband.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   Next time, I'm going to talk about electrification.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.080]   We do have, and especially with the administration talking now about a future investment, we do
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.320]   have a chance to build maybe not a new world, I mean the old world, but that things are
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320]   going to change.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.680]   I think it's really important for us not just to say, it's going to change.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.920]   It could be awesome.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.680]   We need to start taking the steps.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.040]   We need to articulate what we want that look like in trying to find concrete actions to
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.320]   take for that.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:28.000]   That might be something as simple as saying, writing to your congressman about the importance
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.840]   of taking the FCC's e-rate program and using that to broaden broadband access to people
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.520]   in rural areas.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.240]   Or it could be something as difficult as trying to electrify your entire home.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   There's so many options.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.800]   Yeah, I think that's a good way to handle it.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.280]   I'm really pleased that you're doing that.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   I'll have to start listening to that segment because that's a really good way to think
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.320]   about it is, well, here's the opportunity.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.120]   I should probably write these down.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, it'd be great.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.720]   I have one thing I wish.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.320]   No more April Fool's jokes ever again.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   Amen.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.800]   I screamed this morning and said, "Don't you dare today.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.200]   Don't you dare pull that crap."
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.000]   I mean, I could make a case on the one hand.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Maybe we all need a little levity, a little laugh.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.800]   There's nothing funny about April Fool's jokes.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.520]   Wait, I will tell you.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.600]   And this is not technically an April Fool's joke, but I tweeted this out.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.640]   Let's see what if I couldn't find it.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.840]   You know, Janelle, oh, what's her name?
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.080]   I'm going to come up with it.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.160]   Janelle Shane, so @janelleseshane on Twitter.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.000]   She did, I use the neural net GPT2 to generate some April Fool's pranks.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.880]   And it is quite delightful.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   So here, let me--
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.720]   What's the Twitter handle?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.840]   Could you spell it?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   @janelle, here, I'm going to drop it in the--
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.560]   No, just spell the last name, James.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.040]   Oh, Shane, S-H-A-N-E.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.600]   Janelle C. Shane.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.000]   Janelle C. Shane.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   See if I can find her.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.760]   Yes, I think I did.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.160]   She blogs at aiweardness.com.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160]   Is she like--
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   Yes, she's--
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   She's--
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   She's like--
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   Do you not follow her?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   She's so fun.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.320]   No, following right now.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.760]   It's a needed laugh.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.840]   So she's an expert in artificial intelligence.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.640]   Artificial intelligence in her--
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   And neural networks.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   --using GANS, generative adversarial networks.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.800]   So she feeds things to neural networks, and then she--
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   So here's a few.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.400]   Here's a few.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.800]   This is her wild prank fest based on GAN AI,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   colorfully wrapped pasta with sweet pickles and a hot bath.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.840]   Ha!
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.680]   Skittles-- apparently she did it too, which is hysterical.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.580]   Skittles on wood skewers luring yet more
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.660]   skittles to their skewery doom.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.380]   Red fridge spiders.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.380]   And she did them.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.060]   That's the funny thing.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   Wow.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.060]   This woman did them.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.900]   So, yeah, these are delightful.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.460]   Like, tear up a roll of toilet paper and make toast out of it.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460]   Oh, I see.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.900]   This is another woman, Micah McKinnon, who actually made them.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   So like--
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.900]   Oh, my God.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.500]   My favorite is put your fear of insects in women.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.900]   Put your fear of insects where?
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.900]   Into a lemon.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.980]   Toilet paper toast with shredded toilet paper toppings.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.860]   Radishes festooned with part of my inexplicably enormous stash of plastic breads.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.260]   It's clips.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.580]   OK.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580]   This is good.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   I don't know if all of these are GANs, but they're very funny.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   That's cool.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.420]   Yeah, so there is some value to April Fool's.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   I just--
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.420]   No, there's not.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.420]   So this business wake up with dread.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.420]   It's like dark mode.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   It's like a dark mode of humor.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.420]   This is a good--
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.300]   It should be eliminated.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   So Google decided not to--
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   Like, is that organic over--
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.820]   It's a full side of just good taste.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   Normally--
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   Civilization.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.780]   Normally Google, as you know, really kind of goes over the top.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.020]   And of the last few years, they've calmed down.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.140]   According to an internal email obtained by Business Insider, Google will quote, "Take
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:25.020]   the year off from that tradition out of respect for all those fighting the COVID-19
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   pandemic.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.500]   Our highest goal right now is to be helpful to people.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.420]   So let's save the jokes for next April, which will undoubtedly be a whole light brighter
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   than this one."
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.740]   We've already stopped any centralized April Fool's efforts, but realize there may be
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.260]   smaller projects with teams we don't know about.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.580]   Please suss out those efforts and make sure your teams pause on any jokes they may have
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.580]   planned internally or externally.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   I don't--
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.220]   Don't you dare.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.980]   I am much relieved because I wake up with dread on April 1st thinking, "I--"
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.060]   "When I have to sort through before I do the shows today, didn't see anything."
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   I saw--
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.380]   Oh, there was a Josh.AI did one.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.380]   Which one, Stacey?
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.380]   Josh.AI did one.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   It was silly.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.380]   And not silly.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.380]   It was just dumb.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.380]   Silly's OK.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.140]   I don't want one that's plausible or breathtaking.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.580]   Well, that's what happened to me is-- because we're huge Roger Federer fans of the House.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.580]   And I saw one report that said he was going to announce on Twitter that he was retiring.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.180]   And that would be huge news.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.540]   I couldn't find any more help.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.540]   Yeah, that's so annoying.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   So why is this happening?
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   Well, I said, it's April 1st.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   It's April 8th.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.540]   I don't want to see any Apple buys Microsoft or anything like that.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.740]   So this is Josh.AI.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.580]   Is this real?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.340]   Or is this the April Fool's show?
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340]   Politics.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.580]   It's a voice control for homes.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.180]   Or AI joke was something about politics.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.180]   Oh, so--
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.180]   Maybe they took it down.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.180]   So this is the mistake, Josh made.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:01.300]   Because I thought this was sophisticated AI for the luxury home was the joke.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.980]   No, that's what they do.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.140]   OK, see, this is why you shouldn't do April Fool's.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.940]   Because now I'm going to think of them as a joke.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.300]   What do you mean AI for the luxury home?
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.300]   What the hell?
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.540]   They provide voice control for Crestron.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.460]   Oh, see if that's the answer.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460]   For calling the Butler.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.460]   That's where it's for.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460]   Jeez.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.540]   That little button is just like that button old homes used to have under their dining room
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.780]   tables where they would bring the servants' orders.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.300]   Or I just want to--
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.180]   I want a nice taffeta.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.340]   I want to carpet--
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.340]   Bell chain.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.340]   Bell chain.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.340]   Bell pole.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.340]   Ball pole.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.340]   That's it.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.340]   So what are they?
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.740]   So apparently they took their April Fool's off.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.740]   They may have--
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   They think they did.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.940]   Yeah, it was something about like you call your politician.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.940]   It's not on there.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   OK.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.780]   I think showing some taste.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.020]   It's got to be hard.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.860]   It's got to be hard to be the onion right now, doesn't it?
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   Oh, man.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   They're doing a great job.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.860]   Are they?
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.220]   Yeah, they know how to do it.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   That's set time.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.940]   Because you know it's the onion.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.580]   And there's room for satire in this world, I guess.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.580]   I'm now in the--
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.780]   And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.700]   Yeah, I used to say what I saw you.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.700]   OK, so I rest my case.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.700]   No, man.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.140]   No, don't go there.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140]   No.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.940]   I won't go on screen, but I got to go see what you're talking about.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.940]   Oh, dear.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.940]   OK.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.940]   That's pretty funny.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.940]   But it is funny.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.740]   That's pretty funny because it's the weighted blanket thing.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.420]   Have any of you tried that weighted blanket for anxiety?
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   I have one.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.980]   Yes, my daughter sleeps under one.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.980]   She loves it.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.980]   It keeps her his roots.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.980]   And when I have my friends.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.980]   I will sleep under one, too.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   And they're--
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.980]   Nice.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.980]   What if I'm going to be in a family?
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.980]   And I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:09.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:23.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.980]   I'm going to be in a family.

[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980]   I'm going to be in a family.

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980]   I'm going to be in a family.

[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:29.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   I'm going to be in a family.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.980]   It's a great software.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.980]   It's an antidote to PowerPoint.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   It's an antidote to PowerPoint.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   It's an antidote to the anodyne.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:08.980]   Prezi Video lets you be in the presentation, which is wild.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:15.980]   I'll just give you an example from the Prezi site of what a Prezi presentation looks like.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.980]   I've used these.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.980]   It's nice if they're not expected.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.980]   Probably now, I think people know about them.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   The other thing great about Prezi is that it's not serial.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   You can go from here to there and you can change the paths in something.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.980]   It doesn't presume that everything is just linear.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.980]   It swoops around, but that's how you get C6.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   You have to do it judiciously, I think.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.980]   But you've also organized this stuff.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980]   I've done presentations back in the day when I did them where I would change the pathways.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   The same material based on who I was talking to.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   The other way I've used this, which is nice, is you can in real time annotate the presentation.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.980]   You can modify it.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   Most presentations are on rails.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.980]   This slide is followed by the next slide by the next slide.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   Prezi, you can say, "Let's go down this path."
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.980]   You can make your presentation.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   I've done that really big.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.980]   With lots of stuff you don't necessarily want to cover.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   But as you're interacting with your students or with your listeners, you can change paths.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   The founders are really nice people.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.980]   I think they're Hungarian.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.980]   The negative is expensive.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.980]   There's a free version.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.980]   There's personal usage.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.980]   My students use it.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.980]   That looks pretty good.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.980]   Maybe they've got...
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.980]   They've always had a free rendition that's been good.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   I forget what the preview was.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   But now, but now, that was a cue.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.980]   You could do with video.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:52.980]   The one you're going to want, it's either $7 a month or $19 a month.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.980]   I don't give enough presentations.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   That's the problem.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   To really do that.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.980]   But the video...
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.980]   See, if you're doing Zoom conferences, do these.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   Can I do this on Zoom?
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.980]   Or do I have to?
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   I was on a conference call.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   I don't know if he wants me to say who it is.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   I won't.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:19.980]   But a person you would know, there was a brainstorming call about things to do around COVID.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:27.980]   Suddenly, he just had a whoop, a Corona beer bottle came up and he said, "This is brought to you by Corona."
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.980]   We all were just, "Wow, how do I get that?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   How do I get that?"
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   He said, "It's a present video."
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.980]   That's good.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980]   I'm going to do it then.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.980]   I'm so sick of these calls.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   Hi.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   No, we've never used Zoom.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980]   We use Skype.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   It doesn't let you split your tracks out.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980]   Right.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.980]   For recording, which is a pain.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   I thought it did, Stacey.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.980]   I just started using it because I just started recording some stuff.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   Zoom did, it does.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.980]   Zoom lets you split your tracks now?
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.980]   You can speak or get a track, yes.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   Oh, but then the other people have to send you their tracks?
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   No.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.980]   No.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.980]   I recorded them.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.980]   Well, then--
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.980]   I give you the wrong.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   I didn't use this, but I saw it was in the options.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.980]   I looked at it, but it was under duress.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.980]   Skype was behaving badly and I needed to record a podcast.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   I just ended up recording it and having to edit without splitting tracks, which was kind
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   of a pain.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   The other weird thing is, I'm the host of-- I talked to an amazing Yale epidemiologist,
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   Greg Gonzalves, who's been a trenchant critic of media coverage of the crisis.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   Oh, yes, he had it.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980]   Oh, boy, is he here.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.980]   Oh, is he great.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   So I talked to him for about 40 minutes.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.980]   One weird thing is, so I'm the host.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   Leave it on if you would-- leave it where it is.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.980]   I'm the host.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.980]   He's the guest.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.980]   I would think that the host should be where Stacey is, but it always puts the host where
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.980]   I am.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   Lighter thing.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.980]   Do you think-- don't you think that the--
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   The host should be on the left, you're saying.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   Yeah, the host should be on the left.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   As I am right now, it would be crazy if I were on the other side, which is--
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   It would look very well.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   I'm usually in the middle.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.980]   Yeah, I don't know, Jeff.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   Maybe it's-- yeah, I don't know.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.980]   You know, in countries where we go left to right, maybe you're right.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   There are countries where they go right to left.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   Maybe it's British.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   So on the rundown under other, I have Siva Vadianathans Zoom backgrounds.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   Which I think you're going to want to show, because there's a whole series of them.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.980]   Okay, let me pull those up.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   And then we will-- we do have some non-COVID news.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   We have news.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   There's actually quite a bit of it, but I will talk about that in a little bit.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.980]   Just a second.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.980]   So you put it-- where did you put it under--
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   Under other.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   Under other, well, the right--
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.980]   Where everything?
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.980]   Under--
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.980]   Yeah, as I see it, I see it, Newsweek.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980]   Yes.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   Right.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.980]   It's from Newsweek.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   What is Newsweek these days?
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.980]   No, it has some stories that are okay, but then it's otherwise kind of weird.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.980]   I--
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:11.980]   So in my youth, I think I've mentioned this before, you were either a Time magazine family
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.980]   or a Newsweek magazine family.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.980]   Right?
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   Or Colgate or Pepsident.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.980]   But it was a little more-- it was a little more political, because Time was a little more conservative
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.980]   and-- and Newsweek was a little more liberal, because it was the Washington Post Company.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.980]   And Time was Timing.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.980]   But we got life, so I'm confused.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   When I grew up confused.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.980]   [LAUGH]
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.980]   But I loved Newsweek.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.980]   I read it, you know, from the moment that became--
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.980]   That was a real magazine.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.980]   --aware every week.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.980]   It was a great weekly magazine.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   Then it got sold and-- I don't know.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   Some strange company owned it and all that.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   But-- so you're saying some of this is okay, because all I remember--
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.980]   Some of it's okay, but--
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   Is the horrific cover story when they went back to print, saying,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   "We've discovered this creator of Bitcoin.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   It's this guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.980]   It wasn't."
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   It was just some random guy they found name.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   I don't know if they never retracted it.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   And they never attracted it.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.980]   Never attracted it.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.980]   Not that I saw it.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.980]   They didn't do it publicly.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   Maybe they did it in their secret thoughts at home at night.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:09.980]   So--
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   To go--
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   --journalist wins Zoom.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.980]   Is this it?
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:14.980]   No, no, you're a troll.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   That's a troll, though.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.980]   He's not a journalist.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   Oh, I love these guys.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   I was a professor.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.980]   He used to be.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   Here's--
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   So Siva is on the left as all presenters should be.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   And he's using that very famous now meme of the guy walking with his girlfriend,
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   but checking out the hot girl going in the other direction.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   And of course his girlfriend's not too happy about that.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.980]   But Siva is the hot girl going in the other direction.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.980]   Is that brilliant?
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   I just love that.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   And it honestly looks like the guy's checking out Siva's rear end.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   I'm just saying.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.980]   There's a whole bunch of them there.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   There's more than one.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   I want this.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   This is not great.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.980]   Siva's brilliant.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   I love Siva.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   If you go back to the news week, they put them together.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.980]   Oh, there's more than this week.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.980]   OK.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.980]   Journalist wins Zoom.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:11.980]   Oh, this is from Bohemian Rhapsody.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980]   He is Freddie Mercury.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.980]   Yes.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980]   And notice, by the way, that touched a detail, attention to detail Siva put on a black T-shirt.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   So that he'd fit in with the black background.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.980]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.980]   And there's more.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.980]   That's more.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.980]   That's right.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   I think below knows that it.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980]   Is that all?
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   This is how to do it, I guess.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   That was all I see.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   And then I put another thing right right below that in the rundown.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.980]   Which just made me giggle a few minutes ago while we got out there.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   I'll let you read the tweet yourself.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   Man, turns himself into a pre-read.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.980]   So my boss turned herself into a potato.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   And our Microsoft Teams meeting can't figure out how to turn it off.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.980]   So she was stuck as a talking potato.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.980]   I just love that.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   I just love.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   By the way, apparently a potato that's not been dug up.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.980]   She's underground, but she does have lipstick.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   Oh, my God.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   Maybe giggle so much.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.980]   OK, we got a whole new thing going here.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   We got a whole new thing going here.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.980]   I didn't know you could do something new.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.980]   Teams.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   Yeah, let's take a break.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   There is.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.980]   I don't know if you read it.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:33.980]   The funniest story of the week is the guy who is trying to invent a device to keep you from touching your face.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   Oh, it's the greatest story.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   It's the greatest story.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.980]   We will save it for later.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.980]   Come back.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980]   We'll save it for later.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   You go, stay around.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   You want to come back to that.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   I'll take a break around for that because that's.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.980]   It goes from bad to every line of it.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   It's perfectly written.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.980]   I showed it.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.980]   I brought to you by Mint Mobile, the Fox.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.980]   In fact, I'm proud of Mint Mobile.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   They are doing a very good thing.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   At least through April 14th, I suspect they're going to extend that.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:09.980]   Mint Mobile is providing all current and new customers with free unlimited high speed data add-ons.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   So no limit to your data.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.980]   If you want to know more about that, if you're a customer already, mintmobile.com/unlimited.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.980]   I am a happy Mint Mobile customer.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   Mint Mobile is what we call an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   They resell the connection from one of the big four, soon to be the big three.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   In fact, in this case, it's T-Mobile.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:37.980]   So you're going to get the same service you get from T-Mobile, but you're going to get it for a price you may not actually believe.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980]   This is no April Fool's joke.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:47.980]   The reason is, your bill, your wireless bill, your 70, 80, 90, 100 dollar a month wireless bill pays for a lot more than just your wireless connection.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   It pays for stores and marketing and overhead and thousands of employees.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.980]   Mint Mobile's reimagined how you buy wireless.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   They've made it all online, no stores.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   And the savings go right into your pocket.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide text, nationwide talk, crazy fast 4G LTE.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.980]   You choose how much LTE you want.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   You can bring your own phone, but port your number over.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   It makes it easy.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.980]   They sell phones too, but you can bring your own phone and port your number that way.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.980]   Even your contacts go over with it.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.980]   So it's a painless transition.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   They'll send you the SIM for free.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   No charge for the SIM.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.980]   And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered with a seven day money back guarantee.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.980]   Here's the introductory plan.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:40.980]   Three months, $15 a month unlimited nationwide talk, text, three gigs of data.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   And right now, no unlimited data.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.980]   So that's pretty awesome.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   I liked it so much.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   I did the trial and said, this is good.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   So I bought the most expensive plan they have, which gives me unlimited nationwide talk and text and 12 gigabytes of data a month.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   Most expensive plan they have, I bought a year for $300 that's $25 a month.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.980]   That's less than a third when I'm paying T-Mobile for the same thing.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.980]   And it's guaranteed for 12 months, I love it.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.980]   Cut your wireless bill down to $15 a month with a three month introductory plan.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.980]   And get the plan shipped to your door free at Mint Mobile.com/Twig.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.980]   You got to check it out, Mint Mobile.com/Twig.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.980]   Do what I did, start with the $15 a month, three months introductory plan.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.980]   Then you can decide if you like it.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.980]   Okay, maybe you should go for the, you'll know how much data you need.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.980]   Mint Mobile.com/Twig.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   Really awesome.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:53.980]   And it just makes me wonder, why am I paying so much, you know, to Verizon or Sprandered T-Mobile or AT&T when you get it for so little, $15 a month with a three month introductory plan.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:45:00.980]   By the way, this just crossed the wire. Thank you, Jay Cup in our chat room.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   John Ledger has now resigned as a T-Mobile CEO.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   So that's the end of an era.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   I think it's effective now, right?
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.980]   April 1st, the deal was consummated. He's done.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   I guess consummated is probably the right.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   There was a rumor he was going to go to WeWork.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.980]   I think that was put to rest. He's not going to WeWork.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.980]   What is he, you know him, right? Stacey, what is he going to do?
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.980]   Slow cook or sundays? I don't know.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.980]   I mean, that's what he does now.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   I really like the guy. And I think we owe him a debt because I think with all of this crazy marketing and the magenta, he really did force the other companies to say, "Okay, we could be better cut our prices."
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.980]   He was a good marketer.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.980]   He was hard on them.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.980]   Great marketer.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   And boy, his social media team, their lives were hard because he was un...
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   I mean, he was filtered like, "I'm filtered," like, not totally crazy, but he's kind of like, "Yeah, let's be real."
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.980]   But I think that's why people loved him. It was real.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   That is one thing I'm hoping we get from all of this.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   When you see the anchors, when you see, it's so funny to see them in their homes.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.980]   I love it. I just love it.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:14.980]   And I mean, some of them, they're all trying to look like they have nice places, obviously.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   But when Andy Sinkooper is sitting in his book line, Gloria Vanderbilt Library, you know that he lives just a little bit better than the rest of us.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.980]   So my favorite was Casey Hunt, who I think is really great.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   In hers, I tweeted, I said, "I never would have thought Casey Hunt would have been one to organize books by color, because she has a red shelf and a blue shelf."
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   And she laughed and came back.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   Oh, my God.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   I read voraciously. I can tell you exactly where every book is, but I also like design.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:50.980]   And then she showed me pictures of her other bookshelves around.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   Michael Beschloss has the killer office that I would die for.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.980]   Beautiful blonde wood and stone.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.980]   Oh, my Lord is it gorgeous.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   Yeah, he's a professional.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.980]   He's pretty much pay well.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   Historian.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   Oh, and then there's Bill Crystal. Did you see Bill Crystal's office?
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   No.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   Okay, he's sitting in front of the requisite bookshelves.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   Apparently, if you're going to do it, you've got to have built-in bookshelves.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   And one side is nice and neat over here.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:24.980]   And the other side, it looks like he just stuffed everything possible in every which way.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.980]   I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:34.980]   It was an even, I think it was Anderson Cooper, even said, "Your books, oh no, it was MSNBC.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.980]   It was Brian Williams.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.980]   Your bookshelves look just like mine," said Brian, which is typical Brian Williams.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.980]   Because I doubt very much Brian Williams bookshelves looked like that.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   But the other one that you use, Claire McCaskill, was getting horrible, horrible video when she was on a major thing.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.980]   And obviously, she's much too far away from the router, so she's now in her kitchen.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.980]   Just kind of nice.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   I love it.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   But she's got the sink right behind her.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.980]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]   And that's what I'm thinking.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:09.980]   What I'm thinking to be is the men who in this state are putting on a suit and tie.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   Maybe no pants, but a suit and tie.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   I know.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.980]   But only from here up, because you know they're wearing sweats underneath.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.980]   Don't you think?
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.980]   Well, why would you?
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   Usually I wear pants for this show.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   You get dressed up?
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   Like they are wore sweats.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.980]   Or wore sweats because like, well, pants are not dress up.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.980]   And you're not standing up, although you did just stand up, so.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   I see guys that I constantly stand up because I'm running off like to do things or get coffee.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:45.480]   So that's my hope is that finally we can see people, all these people on TV as normal
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   people living a normal life and kind of take them off.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.300]   I don't want to knock them off the pedestal.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   I have respect for them.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.060]   I'm raising their talent.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.540]   Let them be human.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.660]   Because it's not healthy for us to look up at them.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:03.680]   And honestly, people on TV, all it takes, you know, you get a reality show, you can be
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.860]   present in the United States.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.420]   It's not a good, it's not a good value to have.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   Oh, he's on TV.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.220]   He must be, he must be good.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.220]   She must be great.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.460]   So long ago, I was one of the first to do webcam live on MSNBC.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   Really?
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.460]   Nice.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:24.180]   Many, many years ago on, on connected coast to coast, I think it was called with Ron Reagan,
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.580]   Jr. and Monica Crowley, and I used to do the blog segments.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   What are the bloggers?
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:35.300]   Well, Jeff Jarvis joins us from his basement to talk about the law.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.460]   So I had to go into the studio every time, every day of time.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.060]   And then one day they needed me and they had me open the segment and it was a blizzard
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.060]   and I couldn't get in.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.060]   I said, guys, it's time.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.060]   We could do it.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.020]   And so I had it set up in my, in my office in the house with books on top of things and
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   all kinds of stuff.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.780]   And of course it was jerky, but, but the CEO at the time went into the control room and
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.780]   said, I love it.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.780]   This is so real.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.460]   And so it was hot for about a month.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.220]   It didn't hurt that MSNBC was at the time owned by Microsoft.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.220]   I might point out.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.220]   Yes.
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.220]   Yes.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.780]   I did quite a few of those hits later as well because they wanted to show off Skype and
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.020]   they wanted to show Microsoft products and stuff like that.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.020]   Well, this is love.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   And be techy.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.020]   Yes.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.020]   And be techy.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.020]   Yeah, they wanted to be techy.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.020]   So we had some news?
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.020]   Yes.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.900]   I actually wanted to ask you about this.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   You promised people something.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.700]   Oh, no, I'm saving them for later.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.700]   Well, we got to do that.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.700]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   Good cheese.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.420]   I'm not using all the good stuff.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.420]   I'm trying.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   I'm going.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   Okay.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   You got to get me wrong.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   The news.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.620]   Magniboy is coming later.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.140]   I've got to do at least three moral panics before you get that reward.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.140]   Exactly.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.940]   You've got to earn your dessert and one Gutenberg.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.140]   And Facebook, did it.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.080]   Stacey is a little giddy today.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   I like this.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   Good.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   You know what?
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.080]   Jeff, we're cheering her up.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   She's laughing at the potato.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   We're cheering her up.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   Yes.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   We're making her feel better.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.840]   Y'all are probably the most interaction I've had.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.200]   Well, since Kevin this morning.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   But no, that's really.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.400]   There's two of y'all.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   This is my hope.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.840]   Initially, podcast audiences plummeted.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.440]   I have to be honest with you.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.520]   When this first started, I think because everybody was so concerned, they were listening.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.480]   I'm sure the daily went through the roof.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.880]   But I thought I was, I kind of liked it.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   According to PodTracker, it does measurements for this kind of stuff.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.720]   The number one podcast to really get hit hard, My Nemesis, the true crime podcasts.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:33.600]   Oh, oh, right.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.640]   It got so bad for a while.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   We were talking to people.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.880]   They said, "Well, do you have a true crime podcast?"
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   It got so bad.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.600]   I said, "Lise, look, I have a treatment."
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.840]   I just got to go kill somebody.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.200]   No, I have a treatment.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   So I got a treatment.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.840]   This is a great true crime podcast.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.040]   It would be wonderful.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.160]   It has to do with tech.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.320]   We'll never do it, but I wanted to do...
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.640]   Was it the Broadcoms spent?
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.520]   No, it was not.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.080]   Nothing to do with Broadcom.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.360]   Remember Adrian Lamo?
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:09.600]   The hacker who died, it was supposedly serious, a suicide, but there are some real questions.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.280]   I thought it would be a very interesting series.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.440]   What happened to Adrian Lamo?
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.480]   Because as you go through the story, it's fascinating.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:25.960]   He's the guy who turned in Chelsea Manning, was reviled by the hacker community.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.000]   I don't think he did it.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   He was on the spectrum.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.840]   I think he just said, "Sometimes people on the spectrum do.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.840]   This is the right thing to do.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   What do you do?
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   You always do the right thing.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.760]   You don't consider the consequences or there's no shades of gray.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.280]   It's black or white.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   It's the right thing to do."
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.760]   I think that's what he did.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.240]   But he died under mysterious circumstances.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.560]   His family and girlfriend never thought he committed suicide and furthermore, and this
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:57.400]   is given away the best part, they found taped to his thigh a name and address.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.400]   Ooh, it's getting a good part.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   See?
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   True crime podcast.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   I got it.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.680]   It's all ready to go.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.920]   Never going to do it now.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:13.520]   Anyway, true crime podcast down, but the podcast's audiences are starting to come back up again.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.680]   We're noticing this anyway.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.920]   It's my hope and feeling that people are looking for their friends to join them.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.840]   I went down also because people aren't commuting.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.920]   That's when the house was broken, but then people needed to go back to school.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.760]   We're here where your friends were going to keep doing the show.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.280]   I think it is somewhat, I hope it's somewhat reassuring to have your friends in your ear
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.680]   and talking about stuff that's going on in our lives, but also the news.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Like this one.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.280]   I thought of you, Jeff, when I saw it, because you've done some work with Facebook.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.000]   You're all about journalism.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.560]   Let's be clear here.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.640]   I'm in a way paid by Facebook.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.760]   I raised the money for the school from Facebook, which I do this close, but I don't work for
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   Facebook.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.120]   You had an advisory role at some time, right?
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   No.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.160]   According to the Wall Street Journal, they have pledged $100 million for news outlets
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.560]   hit by Corona.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:13.920]   In fact, there's been some talk about how do we save local news?
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:21.120]   Now, it's not all, it's $25 million in emergency grant funding for smaller news outlets with
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.880]   immediate needs.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.720]   $75 million in ad spending.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.960]   Is that ad spending on media?
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   I didn't look.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.200]   That's my question.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:36.000]   It would be fine if it's ad spending on those newspapers, but if it's on Facebook, this is
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.400]   what Google did.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:42.200]   It was actually $800 million, but it was mostly ads.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   So 75 million in ad spending to help news outlets of all sizes make up for expected revenue
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   shortfall.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.120]   I think that sounds like it's never going to buy ads in those newspapers, which would
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   be great.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120]   It should be great.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   Or what?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.960]   Mark, I don't know, whatever Facebook selling.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.280]   For saying, see, you remember when you love Facebook?
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.640]   We're like that.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.560]   We're not so bad, are we now?
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560]   Huh?
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.800]   Just a student, yeah.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.280]   This Wall Street Journal quotes Campbell Brown, who, of course, is the face of Facebook news
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.480]   former, which was a CNN, right, Jeff?
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   Yep.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   Former CNN journalist.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   Every business is suffering now, but the news industry has really been struggling, and
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.960]   we are in a privileged position to be able to help.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:28.160]   She says Mark Zuckerberg feels that getting accurate news about the virus is vital, and
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.880]   he has a real responsibility here.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.480]   It's obviously a public relations.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   Of course it is.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   Of course it is.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.640]   But it's a good thing.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.320]   Well, actually, I emailed them today.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:45.160]   Not an official relationship, but I had a couple of ideas about how Facebook could help.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.040]   And I think that we all got to pitch in, and they got some power here, and they've got
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.600]   a good moment when people are reading.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.000]   So Facebook traffic, I think we said last week, was up 50%.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah, social.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.560]   And then there was another story out today.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.040]   I didn't put it in the rundown.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.280]   Maybe it was in the right eye, maybe sorry.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:06.920]   That's where I read it, Carston, that traffic to news on Facebook is up considerably.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.680]   So they're benefiting from the crisis.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.280]   And news is benefiting.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   This is an expansion.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.040]   But no one wants to advertise against it.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.600]   That's absolutely true.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   That's absolutely true.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.000]   A huge, huge problem, and the advertisers should be ashamed of themselves because everybody
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.600]   is treating it now.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.040]   Every story is corona.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:30.280]   You saw YouTube is demonetizing any YouTuber who just mentions it.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.080]   Yeah, which is ridiculous.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   That's really ridiculous.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   We're done.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   Because that's bad.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   Yeah, well, I...
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.560]   Well, look, there's lots of brands.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.840]   I mean, you'll see things like in, I see in my Twitter feed and on Instagram brands putting
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:47.720]   out like, you know, like soap, proctor and gamble telling us to wash our hands and saying
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.120]   like, you know, then I can't think of their soap brands right now.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.360]   But Downey, I resope wants you to wash your hands.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.880]   Those kind of ads would play just as well on a newspaper.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.800]   I mean, it's brand advertisement as opposed to like something specific, but it's basically
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:09.680]   saying I give a, I give a hoot about the world that we live in, you know, associate my brand
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:14.120]   with not coronavirus, but information.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:20.040]   It's not unusual for the marketing departments to take the wrong direction initially, you
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.200]   know, and add a panic.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.680]   Well, I get off of this.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:28.280]   But one hopes now is this is as you mentioned, a slow-moving train wreck.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.680]   Over time they'll realize, no, no, there's, you know, the right way to do this.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.480]   And I did hear somebody say, I'm sorry I'm quoting you without attribution, but it was
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.000]   really right on.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.680]   This brands are going to have to remember people will remember what they do in this
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.280]   crisis.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.960]   This will resonate for your brand.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.480]   You know, when Disneyland says, hey, sorry, you signed up for a year pass.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.680]   You got to pay us every month.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.600]   Doesn't matter if the park's closed.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.280]   That does not roose out or down well.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   They're saying.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.920]   Some airlines saying, I can't give your money back.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.280]   We'll give you a credit where you want to go next month.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.480]   And it's like, yeah.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.760]   So these things will be remembered.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.400]   And I have a feeling most brands will realize that and do the right thing.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   They should.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   And also how you treat your employees.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:17.640]   Well, more is not going to take the temperature of everybody coming in and Amazon and food
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.160]   has had a strike yesterday.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.760]   And then Amazon fired the guy who organized a strike.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.760]   Right.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.080]   Saying, oh, he broke, he broke social distancing rules.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   Not smart.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.560]   That is really bad PR.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.800]   That's just terrible.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.000]   And they're going to suffer from that.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   And that's mishandling it because there's an opportunity here to really they, you know,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.640]   they're hiring 100,000 people, Wal-Mart's 150,000 people.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   Who was it?
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   Was it DoorDash?
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.120]   300,000 people.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.040]   I mean, these are the only jobs out there.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:57.440]   These people, they could come out heroes here and they, that is stupid to.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.600]   And I think we're going to be in this for a full year and not, not quite at this level,
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.040]   but at some level here.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:10.160]   And so I think that that we're going to be able to tolerate the brands behavior is not
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.280]   just a one month and it's over.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   Stay safe.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   You seem to have that.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.560]   I got excited news, news.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:21.840]   Microsoft announced that they're going to keep their events virtual through the end or through
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.920]   the first half of 2021.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.800]   Sorry, I don't know what I almost said 2018.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   So all through next year.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.880]   So tying into what you're saying about this lasting a long time.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:40.760]   This is a, I mean, Microsoft, their executive leadership, intelligent, very good at processing
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.200]   information and fairly conservative around these things.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:53.160]   So that's a, I think it's also a, maybe an indicator that even after this is over, even
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.840]   after you don't have to do that, a lot of conferences are going to go virtual.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.920]   Oh, if there's a question, education is going to change tremendously.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.080]   We're talking about that, you know, every minute now.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.320]   By the way, I tweeted today that, that, I'm not the first to do what I'm sure, but I've
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.520]   a reason I'll be clear about the second that Apple is the new Microsoft and Microsoft
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520]   is the new Apple.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:18.200]   Because yes, Apple bought dark sky and it's killed.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.040]   Oh, and pissing me off bad.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.320]   I so I tweeted about this because it's, I am so frustrated, not actually at Apple.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.760]   They're just doing what they're just Apple in along.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.880]   You know, Apple's going to do what Apple's going to do.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.720]   Not far from their tree.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:46.360]   I will say Google, I fault them for not kind of, I guess, anticipating this and to making
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.960]   the acquisitions to make their ecosystem look good and then building an ecosystem that mainstream
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.680]   users can appreciate and enjoy.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.120]   Because it is too damn difficult to do anything within Google.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.040]   I mean, Jeff, your favorite complaint about G Suite, I pay Google and I hate the service,
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040]   right?
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   But it's just constant Google.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.920]   They're like, we have the coolest stuff.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.000]   We have created a brilliant tech solution for the world.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.440]   It will make everything better.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   They throw it out there.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.320]   They don't make it accessible to people at all.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.760]   And then they wonder, they wonder why people turned out.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.240]   Maybe they don't, they don't care.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.400]   By the way, in defense of Google, they only did that demonization of COVID for a week.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   They kind of bad.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   They realized that was.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   Oh, they did.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400]   They backed down on that.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.960]   And not all, not all, obviously you don't want to monetize part of, you know, what they
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.000]   even said at the time is we're as advertisers.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.400]   We want to protect advertisers from being associated with videos about bad things, global
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   health crisis.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.280]   What's happening too is the, no matter what Google does, Google is probably just responding
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   to the advertisers.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.120]   The advertisers are putting COVID on their do not buy list.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120]   We did.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.200]   And they are from our own average, some of our, not all, and in fact, only a handful,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.800]   but get queries about that.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.960]   Are you going to talk about COVID?
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   Because we don't want to be on those shows.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.120]   Oh, geez.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.160]   And I think that that's the knee jerk reaction.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   Well, we said it is.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   It is immediate.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.320]   But it's life now, folks.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.080]   We're living it.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:15.040]   If you've got to be there with us and give us empathy and care about us and that's the
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.920]   opportunity you have as brands and opportunity to be human, especially on podcasts like this.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   That's our opportunity.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.200]   We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.360]   this is our chance, all of us to be human, be more human and then in the good part of
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.640]   the human, not the bad part.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.920]   Really usage of Hangouts Meet 25 times this month, what it was in January.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920]   20 times.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.400]   You're sucking for us at the school.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.080]   Oh, are they sucking bad?
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:48.640]   They're having a hard time day over day growth, 60% over the last few weeks.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   It's bad.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.480]   Now it, now it, everybody's fuzzy, but now what happens is if you've got five people
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.400]   in the Hangout, everyone who's not speaking gets frozen until they speak again.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   Wow.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   Yeah, I am super frustrated because I'm getting, what year are we 2020?
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.880]   I still get, I'm like, why am I still having to argue with people over what on the conferencing
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.280]   software I'm going to meet you on?
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.560]   Like, hey, let's FaceTime.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.600]   And I'm like, I can't FaceTime.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.400]   Let's do.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.960]   Let's Skype.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   Let's Zoom.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.720]   I'm just like, what do we, what do we settle on?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.200]   I revert to Zoom because I have a Zoom account.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.040]   Zoom is the default.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.800]   I, I subscribe to Zoom this week because I'm showing his interviews and I needed to do
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   it.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.600]   All of our sales calls are done in Zoom.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.080]   Well, so to get back to this dark sky because I'm upset as you are, Jeff.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.760]   But there is a, this is almost as bad as Tiger King.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.720]   There is a dark side.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720]   Where, how are you?
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720]   Okay.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.880]   Stacey, can you possibly guess how he's going to do this?
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880]   Can you possibly imagine?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   No, I'm like, I'm out for the ride.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.760]   There is a, you don't know.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:07.120]   There is a steamy underbelly to the weather business that you don't even know.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.200]   Actually John Oliver, the only reason I know is because John Oliver did a great piece on
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.320]   it in, I think November of last year.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.520]   I highly recommend it.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.600]   You saw on YouTube, but what's happened and I'm going to get this wrong.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.200]   So I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, I'm vamping a little bit and then correct
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.960]   me if I'm wrong, Chara.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.120]   But what's happened is, so there's the US weather service.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.360]   Every nation has a weather service.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.840]   This is an important part of government for farmers, for disaster prediction, hurricane
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840]   prediction, that kind of thing.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   It's important.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   You know this.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   You went through Sandy.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.000]   This is important.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.360]   So we have a US weather service and really all the other weather services are just icing
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.960]   on top of the data provided by the US weather service, which is provided freely.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   We pay for it.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   Taxpayers pay for it.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960]   Is everybody.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   Is that right?
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   No?
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   Fix it.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:02.520]   Well, so does our sky, but the data starts with the underlying data starts with the weather
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.520]   service with Noah.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.520]   Is that not right?
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.440]   Does AccuWeather, because if it's, AccuWeather doesn't have their, yeah.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   Okay.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.000]   Well, this is the underbelly.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.240]   This is the Seemee underbelly because everybody wants to pretend they're doing something different
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.520]   and they are because you know, you get different forecasts.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.320]   Weather underground gets it.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.000]   They have weather stations, but weather stations alone are not enough.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.600]   You know, home weather stations are not enough.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.440]   You still need the satellite data that you get from the US weather service.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:43.080]   But the US weather service is now run by the former CEO of the Weather Channel.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:52.040]   And furthermore, IBM bought weather.com and is using Watson now.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.080]   And I think what really happened here, dark sky was a Kickstarter five years ago, was a
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.880]   Kickstarter and they said, we want to use AI to do hyper local.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.880]   That was going to be their special sauce, hyper local using AI.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.760]   Still had to use the Noah data.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.320]   You can't get around that.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.480]   But maybe they use weather station data or something else.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.240]   And they were very successful Kickstarter.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.440]   And then I think they got sold.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   I can't remember who bought them.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.920]   Remember forecast.com?
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.240]   And then either they merged with it or they bought dark sky and forecast.com became dark
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   sky.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   Yeah, I can't remember.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.480]   Remember, there was a little thing and a lot of programs now use the dark sky API.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.960]   There's kind of a battle because there's the weather underground API.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.520]   There's the dark sky API and there's the weather.com API.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.320]   And I think what Apple was doing with this.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.720]   Now there's, first of all, they didn't need a weather app.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   Right?
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.000]   No, you don't need a weather app.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.720]   So we're not sure why they bought them, right?
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.360]   Did they want the engineers?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.400]   There's something special dark sky is doing on all things.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.960]   Not much, no.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   So why do they buy this?
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:06.880]   And I think this is part, there is some political battle going on that we're only seeing the
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.280]   tip of the iceberg in the weather biz.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.920]   So the question to post has a story on this from November.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.480]   And they say until recently, AcuWeather, Earth Networks, the WeatherCo and other private
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.600]   weather providers relied on the fire hose of data from NOAA's National Weather Service
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.760]   and satellite arm, as well as NASA.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.560]   The CEO of Weather Service became the guy from weather.com.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.560]   No.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   No.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.880]   Now companies are finding it advantageous to produce their own data and using analytics
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.640]   in business-savvy ways, tailoring their forecast to specific real world problems, such as wildfires.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.960]   And now that they have their own ability to launch satellites and supercomputers and
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.440]   to harvest data from semi-autonomous vehicles and wearables, these new arrivals are leapfrogging
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.160]   the information gathering capabilities of federal databases.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.120]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   Look up Louie Oochalini.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.160]   That's so hot.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.240]   He was the CEO of AcuWeather.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.960]   And he is Donald Trump's, not weather.com, but AcuWeather.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.680]   And he's Donald Trump's NOAA Director.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.720]   He's not a scientist.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.160]   He is a businessman and a lawyer.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.360]   And I'm telling you, and I watched the John Oliver bit.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.320]   There's some serious stuff going on underneath the surface here.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.800]   All these guys pretend we got something special.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:35.120]   Oh, in the 2020 budget, President Trump is asking NOAA to buy data from private companies.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   Oh, what private company might that be?
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.960]   I believe yes, it could be any of those interesting.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.680]   Oh, that would be interesting.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.360]   So Apple's buying this because for the same reason that, I mean, when IBM bought the weather,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.080]   the weather, the weather, the weather channel.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.520]   Weather channel, thank you.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.040]   That was very much about that was in the same time.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   That's about Watson.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.440]   No, it was actually about the benefits.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.600]   It was a realization that weather data is key.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.320]   This was about the same time that climate core was purchased for like a billion something
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.760]   by Monsanto.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.760]   And it was a coming realization that climate change was affecting the weather in increasingly
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.440]   disruptive ways for businesses.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.280]   And we needed to be able to anticipate that.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.120]   And businesses pay a lot of money.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   And they do.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120]   They pay a ton of money for that.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   I knew I'd get this wrong.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:28.360]   I bury Myers, whose family owns AccuWeather, is now the director of NOAA.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:36.480]   And the concern is this intermingling of business interests and taxpayer scientific
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.240]   research and scientific data.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.880]   So it's a, I don't know.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.360]   I watch the John Oliver thing.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.080]   I'm only dimly remembering this.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.480]   But my point is I think the dark sky thing is part of an overall play for this data and
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.640]   concern about this data.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.760]   And for one thing, Apple doesn't want IBM don't it.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.440]   I mean, and weather is one of the most essential and important.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:08.560]   And it doesn't have the weird privacy connotations that health data has, which is the other big
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.600]   area where having data can actually really impact your bottom line.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.880]   Also those are ways to use data to make money in people in easily accessible ways.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.000]   It's complicated.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.480]   I know.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.200]   I'm sorry that I botched this.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.880]   I should have done some research before I brought this up.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.360]   But I just feel like I've been watching Tiger King.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.400]   And I think the same thing is happening in weather.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.000]   I still don't understand the Tiger King thing, but that's okay.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   Where are you going to watch Tiger King?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Have you watched Tiger King?
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Have you watched Tiger King?
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.680]   No, I'm going to be prideful that I'm never going to watch Tiger King.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:56.400]   It's one of those guilty pleasure free to watch on Netflix documentaries about the weirdest
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.960]   subculture ever, the culture, subculture people who collect big cats.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.560]   They're all over Texas, man.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560]   Well, the Tiger King's in Oklahoma.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.480]   Don't you feel sorry for the cats?
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.480]   The whole thing?
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   I don't want to watch.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.120]   I want to murder for a higher scheme against the woman who runs Big Cat Rescue out of Florida.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.520]   And then there's this guy in Carolina.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:26.080]   It's just, it's the Tiger King had, I think at 1.3 husbands, the guy in North Carolina
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.680]   has at least eight wives.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.480]   The whole thing is bizarre.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.560]   And then the woman who runs Big Cat Rescue, her husband, the millionaire, disappeared
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.200]   mysteriously some years ago.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.160]   In fact, that cold case has now been reopened because of the documentary.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:49.320]   Because the Tiger King, Joe Exotic, says she fed her husband to the Tigers.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   Wow.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   No one knows.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.920]   I'm just saying there is some similarity between the machinations in the Big Cat community
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.760]   and the subterfuge in the weather community.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.240]   Oh, so what's happening with Twitter this week?
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.240]   You may have had an error.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   Hold on.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   I had many errors.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   I know I did.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.520]   Pac Northwest says that Meyer has withdrawn.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   He withdrew and now it's O'chilini.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.480]   Oh, I think.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480]   I don't know.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480]   I don't know.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.480]   I'm confused.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480]   Yeah, he was withdrawn.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.480]   Sorry about that, Carson.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.800]   It's just like, ah.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.520]   Yeah, I know I went all over the place on that one.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.480]   And I know I even said, didn't I not?
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   Did I not?
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.800]   I'm going to get this wrong.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.040]   So I apologize for bringing it up, but I do think there is some subterfuge in the weather
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.240]   community that we need to look into.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:46.040]   Including the selling of this data, this taxpayer data, that is so important, frankly,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.240]   for farmers, for prediction, yeah.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.960]   Hey, dark sky doesn't use our data, though.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.560]   I think they have to.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.120]   Did you not read the article?
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.200]   Did they say they don't use any?
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200]   No, no.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.200]   You said that they have their own secrets.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.920]   They also use some, yeah.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.520]   But I think they also, they, okay.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.000]   Do they have their own satellites?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   They're using satellites.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.560]   There's a company called Spire that provides satellite data to these companies.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.760]   Oh, so there's private data.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.000]   Oh, well, shouldn't we all use NOAA's data?
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   No.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.640]   Well, no, actually the Europeans get our data is wrong a lot.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.560]   Well, I use innovative weather.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.560]   We're casting industry.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   Maybe that's it.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.040]   I use Norwegian weather.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040]   YT dot, you know.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.360]   So what do I use now instead of dark sky?
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   Some so, so.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.320]   Well, like buy an iPhone, Jeff.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.520]   Isn't that that to me is really terrible when you say, oh, and by the way, no more
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.520]   Android.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.880]   Yeah, they also shut up their API.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.280]   That's going to, that's a year for more than a year from now.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280]   It's end of 2020.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.120]   Even then there's still something at all.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.120]   Still a thing.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   It's a shiv up the back.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   Exactly my point.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.280]   I don't like it.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.280]   Exactly my point.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.280]   There's something going on.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280]   It's too.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.720]   Maybe I should have said it to crime.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.560]   We should do true weather.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.240]   We're all just like, there are some real weather geeks out there.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   Oh my God.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   Other people are geeks.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.880]   They're like train washers.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   Absolutely.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   That's far more thermostat for weather geeks.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   EcoB.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   EcoB.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   That room in EcoB is just full of weather.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.080]   What kind of cloud is that?
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.240]   The good news is there are other great weather apps, even on Android.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.440]   So there are many choices.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.440]   Yeah, we're going to talk about Google.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   Let's talk about Chrome updates.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.120]   Do you want to do that?
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.880]   They only put that off for like a week.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   Yeah, so don't be guilty.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   I thought they were going to understand.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.760]   I guess I was just, hey, we're busy this week.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760]   Okay, I get that.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.760]   They said that.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   We were doing stories.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.360]   Oh my God, the Chrome updates were stopping because okay.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.200]   We got a week.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   That's it.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.120]   And we can talk about Google using AI to design chips that will accelerate AI.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.680]   This is the beginning of the day.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.480]   Once they get in that loop, you know how this is.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.080]   The apes, the apes come over the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.080]   That's it, man.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.000]   Who's the Golden Gate Bridge?
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.600]   Are you talking about the new planet of the apes?
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.840]   Let me, let's do the change.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.960]   No, let me think about this here.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.960]   What time is it?
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.720]   Let me do an ad and then I'll do the change log.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   How about that?
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.200]   Yeah, I'm out of here like 715 latest.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.200]   Oh my God.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.200]   That's my time.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   That's my time.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   That's minus three.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   So we got four hours.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   Okay, that's good.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   Fuck.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.160]   Are sure they brought to you by LastPass.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:58.240]   I am a LastPass fan, but now more than ever, you need the security provided by LastPass.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.600]   As you take your workforce home, as you prepare for your employees to work at home,
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:09.560]   you got to figure out a way to keep them working, keep them productive, but also keep
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.440]   your most valuable private resources private.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.680]   And that's why we use LastPass.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.400]   I've always used LastPass at home ever since it started for 10 years, my favorite password
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:25.280]   manager, but LastPass is so much more than a password manager, especially in business.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.160]   LastPass can make the transition from work in the workplace to work at home a lot easier
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.320]   without in any way impacting security.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.800]   For one, there is an uptick already an uptick.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.000]   It's people are horrible in coronavirus related fishing attacks, spear fishing and regular
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   fishing.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.760]   LastPass reduces the risk of fishing because it won't auto fill passwords on suspicious
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   websites.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.680]   And in most cases, your employees don't even know the password, so they can't do it either.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.400]   Love that LastPass.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:03.320]   If you are using a VPN, you probably are for your remote employees to access the office.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.280]   LastPass adds an additional layer of security directly to your VPN through biometric multi-factor
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   authentication.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.680]   That's great.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.680]   That's great.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.400]   If anybody logging in, you want to make sure that's really the person you expect it to
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   be.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.800]   That's where LastPass does such a good job.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.080]   It's all about authentication.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.200]   Regardless of where or how your employees need access, LastPass ensures they have secure
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.640]   access to workplace applications using, of course, their great password manager, but
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.840]   also single sign on.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.200]   If you haven't checked out LastPass Enterprises, single sign on you owe it to yourself.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.000]   It is amazing.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.840]   Employees love it because it's easier than just an app and they say yes and they're in.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:46.560]   They know there's no password at all, at least as far as they can see, and they have 1200
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.120]   plus apps all ready to go.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.720]   They even have training videos and everything.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.880]   So your employees will be up and running fast.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:57.280]   Employees love it and you'll love it because it's more secure than passwords.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.240]   This is the amazing thing about LastPass.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.360]   They do what seems obvious.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.400]   They square the circle.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:09.800]   They actually make it more secure and more convenient, which normally you can't do.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.120]   It's one or the other, right?
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.600]   More security means less convenience, not with LastPass.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.720]   There's an offline mode.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.520]   So sometimes you're experiencing it right now.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.320]   Bandwidth is spotty.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.520]   LastPass doesn't stop working.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.160]   Password management and multi-factor authentication will work offline.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.280]   So even if your employees are in spotty areas or even offline completely, they still can
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.320]   get into stuff that's important.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.040]   It's great for collaboration.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.120]   In fact, LastPass has that built in.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   You could share passwords.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.840]   You can have shared folders or share them directly.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:48.000]   We have folders for the ops, department for engineering, for business, for bookkeeping,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:57.040]   for sales, and only the people who need those get those, but it's very easy to onboard somebody
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.760]   and say, "All right, you're doing sales.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.120]   You have access to this folder now."
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.680]   It's really great.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.920]   It's great for the users, but also great for the admin.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.120]   You can get up and running in minutes.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.320]   They have a globally dispersed, ready-to-respond support and success team.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.280]   So when you're doing LastPass Enterprise, you have dedicated people to help you with
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.960]   your deployment.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.800]   Your IT team will love it because they are in complete control.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.920]   Over 100 policies they can enforce to make sure your stuff stays safe.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.240]   We use require two factor.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.240]   We have minimum requirements for master password, things like that.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.680]   Increased security does not have to be complex.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.080]   It's easy with LastPass.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:43.520]   Your journey today visit LastPass.com/twit to find out how they can help you, LastPass.com/twit
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.080]   as we come to you from the LastPass studios.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   Thank you, LastPass.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   By the way, on a more personal note, thank you, LastPass.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.400]   Because of LastPass, we're making payroll this month, so I'm very sincere.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   Bless you.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   Let us all.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   Sure is.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400]   Thank you, LastPass.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.520]   Thank you for using that address so they know you saw it here at LastPass.com/twit.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   And now, without further ado, I'm going to pull a Karsten.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   And I...
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   Google changed a lot.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.280]   I'm going to, I think, if all the buttons are correctly pushed...
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:24.080]   The Google changed a lot.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.920]   I can do it.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   I can do it.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.800]   I think Karsten does it faster, but...
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   Okay.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.880]   I'm going to do the buttons while I'm doing the ad.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.600]   I can't do two things in one.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   Oh, excuses, excuses.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   I couldn't do that.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   I was too distracted with impeachment.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.080]   I couldn't put the buttons right.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.200]   I've heard that one.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.280]   Google Duo can now support 12-person group video calls.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.520]   I don't know what the limit was before, but that's a lot of people.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.800]   I have to say, yesterday we tried to do our staff meeting for the first time.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.640]   I think we're doing it on Zoom.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   The place is going.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   I can't.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.240]   There's too many people in here.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.400]   And that's only 20 people.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.040]   It's hard to do these big conferences, right?
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:17.840]   Yeah, I will say, though, I use Google Duo to talk to my parents, and I have the...
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.360]   Oh, gosh.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.800]   Nest, hub, max, display, whatever.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   Oh, so you have it on the screen?
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:28.640]   Yeah, so I had it on the screen, and it was autofocusing, and it did such a great job.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:36.560]   I mean, it was a very good experience, and I appreciated the hands-free thing until my
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.960]   mom started yelling at me for making noise in the kitchen.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.600]   We are all using this stuff like crazy now.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.320]   I mean, my daughter's on Android, so I use Duo with her.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.560]   My mom's an Apple person, so she prefers FaceTime.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.520]   She could use Duo's on iOS and Android, but I do FaceTime with her.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.320]   Have you tried to tell an Apple person to download Duo?
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.720]   No, no, no.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.320]   But the funniest thing is I'm talking to my dad, who's on FaceTime.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.080]   My daughter is on Duo, and he's on the screen here.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.040]   I'm holding her up to the camera, so we can all three of us talk, because we couldn't
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.040]   conference, so...
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.040]   And then I put him...
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.040]   But it worked.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.200]   I wish I had a picture of it, because it was the silliest thing you ever saw, but he was
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200]   able to talk to her.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   She was able to talk to him.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   So meanwhile, I need your advice.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.080]   This is a radio show-level question?
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080]   Yes.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:28.320]   My father, who's 94, he's deaf as can be.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.640]   His hearing aids aren't working.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   And then now he says...
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.520]   So I say, "Can we email you, Pa?"
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.120]   "Oh, no, I can't get on the internet."
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.960]   So we're going to be in no communication at all with him at some point.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   Oh, no.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   So here's the question I asked...
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.280]   I asked Sun Jake yesterday, whether it was a Chromebook or a Windows machine.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.760]   He's Windows.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.720]   Is there a way for me to set up the machine here, change the name of my SSID and password,
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.640]   because I know where this password is?
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:02.360]   Set it all up and have one button, just one, that he can use to go and get email from us.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.480]   Can you advice about that?
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.600]   Yeah, but it's going to be fragile.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600]   That's the problem.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.120]   Can you send him a hotspot?
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.000]   Would you pay for it and send him a hotspot?
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.200]   So does he have internet?
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.760]   Well, he has internet.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   Yeah, no, he has internet.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.600]   He did something wrong with his laptop.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600]   He screwed up his laptop.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.280]   He uses AOL still.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   So you have...
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.480]   Yeah, well, that's problem number one.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:33.120]   So what you would want to do is set up a dedicated Gmail account that he could easily...
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120]   Right.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   ...get to.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.000]   That's the only thing the machine can do.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   And he can get to it, and that's it.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.760]   I wish he'll screw it up.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.680]   You could send him an iPad, because you can pin an application.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.840]   This is more parental control, but you can say...
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.120]   And Android will do this too, I think.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.160]   You can pin an application that's just the only application.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.440]   And without the parental code, they can't ever exit that application.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.280]   So basically, it's a dedicated iPad.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.240]   I don't know if you can do that with a Chromebook.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   I wish you could.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240]   Windows, yeah.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.520]   Well, in Gmail, doesn't it now...
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:15.000]   I know that mine asked me for a new password, like me to re-enter my password, like every
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   month?
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   Oh, that's right.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   So we actually, I think we're getting an advertiser that does a senior PC, because this is a...
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.240]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.120]   This is a really common problem.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.280]   I get this call on the radio show all the time.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.320]   And this is exactly what you want.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:40.720]   You want big buttons, you want a few functions, you don't want any way they can screw it up.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.400]   I think it's called Sirona, because I remember we were going, "My Sirona."
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.360]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.000]   You got a little bonus here?
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.240]   Yeah, because I don't think they've even signed up yet, but I was talking to them.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.360]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.000]   No, how do you spell that?
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.500]   That's the question.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.240]   It's not S-E-R-O-M-A.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.280]   No, I think it's...
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.480]   I think it's a brush reconstruction or barbed ribbon for tension and clothes.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   I've seen...
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.480]   Nematomas and...
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.040]   No, I got it wrong.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.600]   Maybe I have the name wrong.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.200]   All right, well, next show.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.840]   Yeah, I see...
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   Oh, "Telken."
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   "Telken."
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.160]   I've seen the "Telken" and I've seen the "WOW."
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.600]   And I think both of them are a little more complicated.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.560]   Both of these require monthly subscriptions, just so you know.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:44.040]   But that's the idea of these, is that they are very simple.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.000]   Most of the time they're running Linux because you can completely configure it.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   Because you control it.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   And have a new user.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.160]   Windows would be the worst because there's no way...
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   But you're right.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   You can't see.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.160]   You'd have this issue of Gmail every once in a while saying, "Well, just for security,
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   what's your password?"
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.840]   Yeah, and I don't know if that...
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   Is that a...
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.560]   I mean, like obviously I have mine set up for MFA and all kinds of things.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.720]   So I'm like, "Is there a...
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720]   Don't ever ask me again saying..."
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.640]   I feel like there might be.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640]   Gmail?
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.360]   Let me ask Lisa.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.000]   See if I can...
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.640]   What's the name of that senior PC?
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   "Jitterbug."
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   No.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   No, that's...
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   Well, that's the...
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.640]   There's a Jitterbug clone.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.400]   Somebody's saying Jitterbug PC, but I don't know.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.000]   I don't know if that's...
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.160]   All right, we'll keep going with the...
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Change log.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.960]   I do think that, by the way, an iPad is probably a really good choice for...
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.320]   But the idea of not having a keyboard and typing on the screen will throw him...
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.920]   Well, if you have a keyboard, you can...
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.680]   They also offer keyboards.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.680]   It's not inexpensive.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   But they're $400.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.440]   The new one is $350.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.440]   This one's only another.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.120]   And I just said, "I don't like Apple."
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.880]   Yeah, well, maybe it's time to get over that, huh?
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.960]   I'm gonna let y'all argue about that.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.560]   So my father gets dark sky and I don't.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.240]   Yeah, dad'll get dark sky.
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240]   Google...
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240]   Not with the weather, Mike.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.240]   It doesn't matter if you're not.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.280]   You know what your dad's gonna say, "Just look out the window, you lazy son of a gun."
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280]   Google rolls out...
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.760]   The apartment is always literally 90 degrees.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.920]   Literally, the thermostat is such a 90.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.080]   Well, does he like it?
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.480]   He does, but it's torture visiting him.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.320]   But he likes it.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   He likes it.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320]   It's fun.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.880]   He's got the big sleep, the Humphrey Bogart movie, where he goes to visit the guy and the
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.160]   guy lives in a greenhouse where it's humid and hot.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.400]   These old bones need to stay warm.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   Google has...
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.160]   I'm a little worried about this one and I'm not sure what it's gonna look like, but Google
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.000]   Drive is about to change a little bit, starting September 30th.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.880]   It's not imminent.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.720]   All your files will live in one folder.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.400]   Oh, no.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.960]   So now you have access to something called Google Drive shortcuts.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.480]   You know how shortcuts work on Windows and Macintosh?
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.200]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:16.240]   So the drive folder structure is gonna change in September, which I think is potentially
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.080]   a disaster.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.440]   All your files will be in a single folder.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:28.800]   It's no longer possible place files in multiple folders, but you can use the shortcuts.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.400]   I haven't seen this new setup.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.360]   Oh, you don't have one folder for everything you own.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.160]   Just a file can only be in one folder.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.600]   All your files will live in one place.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   Yeah, one place only.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   No, no.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600]   So they'll say this, though.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.400]   That's just been clarity.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.960]   You could have 25 folders.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   I hope so.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.000]   I thought you were saying you really have one folder.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   Like a file shortcut.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   So right now I have a...
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.040]   You could only live in one place.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.160]   Yeah, right now I have a Twitch shows folder and it's kind of like shortcuts.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.000]   The file lives there and in another folder.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.920]   Which is not how file systems work in the real world.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.920]   So maybe it won't be so confusing.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.920]   Shortcuts will solve that.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.840]   That's how we do it in the real world.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.160]   You did mention already Chrome updates coming back.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   Good.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.760]   Bloomberg had a story.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.320]   I don't know if this is a problem or not.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.640]   I'm curious.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   Since you hate Apple...
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.440]   Oh yeah, you're gonna be in trouble.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.440]   Why don't you?
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.680]   Since you hate it, you're an Apple hater.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.200]   Thanks a lot.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.320]   Eric German who writes a lot about Apple on Bloomberg points out that App Store rules
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.720]   prevent Google's Stadia and similar services.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:38.880]   The upcoming Microsoft X cloud, Nvidia's GeForce now.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.920]   From working on iOS.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.640]   You cannot get the Stadia App on iOS because Apple's rules prohibit services that rely
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.560]   on streaming from the cloud.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.000]   So you could...
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.960]   I guess one could say it's anti-competitive.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   Apple's got arcade.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.280]   They don't want these other services on there.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280]   I'm gonna guess.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.880]   In fact, I asked Mac Break weekly yesterday, I asked the folks.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.080]   They said, and I think they probably agree with them.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.720]   This is just an old rule.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:09.960]   And at some point, especially if Mark German and others start talking about this, Apple
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.120]   will say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.800]   Of course, you should be able to have gaming services on there."
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.600]   But as of right now, Google Stadia is an Android.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.600]   You gotta use Android if you're gonna do it on a mobile device.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.200]   No Red Dead Redemption 2 for you.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:27.120]   I don't know what that is.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.120]   I know what it is.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   Nobody knows.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120]   Nobody cares.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:38.400]   When asked GeForce now, a spokesperson said, "Ask Apple."
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.800]   Apple said, of course, "Customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:51.560]   and gaming services that can absolutely launch on the App Store if you follow review guidelines."
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.160]   I suspect Apple changes.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.840]   But for right now, that is a little anti-competitive.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:01.080]   Stadia not on iOS.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.360]   And you wanted this story, and I'll let you do it, Jeff.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:11.920]   Or maybe it's Stacey, Google using AI to design chips to accelerate AI.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.320]   She's the chip man.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   It's a very Stacey story.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   That's a Stacey story.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320]   Oh, no.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.800]   I just brought it up as a possible story that actually dealt with Google.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.400]   I think it's interesting.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:26.840]   It's basically saying, "Hey, neural networks are so inexplicable.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.720]   Let's let them design their own hardware that will optimize."
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.000]   And Google actually tried this out, and they built a TPU that--
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   Wow.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.920]   And then we really want to know how it works.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.960]   I mean, we do, because with a chip, there is a physical process that you can break down.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.600]   But the idea is that this will help.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.200]   One of the challenges right now in the world of chip design is chip design from design
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.400]   to an actual functioning chip.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:55.000]   It can be like as long as two years, maybe 18 months if you're really awesome, right?
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.160]   But having-- and part of that is because a human being has to figure out how to put
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.000]   all the pieces together and make sure they work together.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.200]   AI can do that much faster.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.840]   And with neural networks, they change so much.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.480]   The workloads are not staying as stable as they used to be, right?
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.880]   So this can get you from design to hardware.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.680]   It speeds up the design process.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.320]   So it gets you from design to hardware faster, which is a good thing.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.720]   So that's-- and they're using reinforcement learning for this, which is basically the
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.520]   same type of learning they use to teach deep-mind how to play games, which is like, "Here's
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   your goal.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.520]   Go meet it."
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.160]   I love that, because that's real AI.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.400]   That's not some programmer saying, "Well, if this happens, you do that."
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.560]   That's the AI teaching itself.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.440]   Finally, you may remember that last fall, Apple banned InfoWorld-- InfoWorld's-- Alex
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:53.000]   Jones app from the app store, but inexplicably, Google continued to allow it, despite the
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.920]   misinformation.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:59.960]   I guess Alex Jones finally went too far.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.560]   Wired says that Jones disputed the need for social distancing, shelter in place, and quarantine
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.560]   efforts.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:15.160]   And Google finally snapped and banned the InfoWorld's app from the Google Play store.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:21.880]   So it took them a little while, but they finally realized this is a bridge too far.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   And that is the Google Change Log.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.040]   Oh, turn it.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.520]   Play the drums, Stacey.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520]   Play the drums.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.520]   I thought we were getting there.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   Oh, you could've done that.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.520]   I thought I was so good.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.520]   I thought I was so good.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.520]   I had it all queued up.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   I had it in preview.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.520]   Just had to press the right button.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:44.520]   That's the Google Change Log.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:50.880]   In case you didn't notice, I'm doing this all by myself.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.880]   Carson's at home.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:58.280]   I, Carson-- Kevin's at home, our technical director's at home.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.400]   We have one engineer in the studio at any given time because we don't want to take any
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.400]   chances.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   We're trying to protect our team.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.280]   We don't want to infect anyone.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.440]   Or for them to infect me.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.160]   Wouldn't like that.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.960]   I know you're a wise fan, Stacey.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:15.960]   Is this a big story?
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.960]   They updated their firmware to allow you to turn a wise security camera into a webcam?
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.120]   I don't know if it's a big story.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.120]   It's a story.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.160]   I actually was going to do it.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.000]   And then I got distracted by going outside while it was sunny.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.480]   It's interesting that they could do that with a firmware update.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.240]   That's pretty cool.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.360]   All they did was change the zoom.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.040]   It's closer now.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040]   I think they changed your field division.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   That's all they did?
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.040]   Oh, well, never mind.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.840]   Well, I thought it was something more complicated than that.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.480]   We just zoomed in a little bit.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   Yeah, I think it's in the field of view.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   It looks better.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:00.440]   It's really because a lot of people working from home may not have a good camera.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440]   Now they do.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.320]   Yeah, there are tons of people.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.040]   Cameras are sold out.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.040]   Oh, really?
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.760]   I'm taking this home because I want to play with the idea.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.840]   A lot of people have point and shoots.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.360]   And so in many cases, your point and shoot can be modified to become a very good, a better
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.920]   than usual webcam.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.000]   So this is a Canon point and shoot.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.960]   Oh, I was wondering why you grabbed that.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.520]   That's why I got it.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   I don't have to feed it through.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520]   Make it a webcam.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.280]   It's actually not super complicated.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.880]   We had seen this as C.S.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:43.000]   Aunt Pruitt and I had seen it at C.S. because Canon was pushing this as a potential for
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.320]   a webcam because it has zoom and it's got better optics.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.440]   Maybe I wouldn't be pink.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440]   Maybe you wouldn't be pink.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.680]   It's the M20.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.080]   But there are a couple of things that you got to do.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:36:00.400]   For one, you have to have an HDMI cable that has a mini or a micro HDMI.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.840]   I don't know what they call it, but it's a small HDMI out.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.600]   So you have to have a cable that will go from that to something else.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.760]   In this case, this is HDMI.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.520]   I'm going to take an HDMI cable and plug this into a switcher, but you could also plug it
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.520]   into your computer.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.280]   So this is a little adapter.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.720]   And then there's one other thing we had to get which was a battery.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:31.760]   Most of these guys, you can't run them live because the battery will die.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.520]   So we had to get a special adapter.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.520]   You can buy these on eBay.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.320]   I bet you you could still get these on eBay.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.720]   So it's a dummy battery.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.120]   This isn't a real battery.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.400]   It's the same size and shape as a real battery.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.520]   Notice it has a hole in the end so that you can put a power adapter into it.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.400]   And now you can run it continuously.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.120]   It doesn't go to sleep.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.120]   It does have...
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   How much does that little...
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.560]   Oh, these are like 10 bucks on eBay or less.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.920]   No, no, no, the whole thing.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.920]   Oh, the whole thing?
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.600]   I think this is a $200 point-and-shoot, something like that.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.400]   But it's a real camera too.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.600]   I mean, it's actually a very good...
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.920]   So I wouldn't be pink?
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.920]   Well, I can't promise you that.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.600]   Nobody can promise you that.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.840]   I don't want to be pink.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.840]   This is maybe...
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.960]   It's not easy being pink.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   I have to look at the price.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   It might be $400.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   This is the EOS.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   No.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960]   It might be $1000.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.440]   I don't know.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.400]   The EOS M200.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.400]   So...
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.400]   But you can...
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.400]   It has...
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.400]   What you're looking for in any camera...
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.400]   $549.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.400]   All right, never mind.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400]   Forget it.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.200]   It's a pretty good camera.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.520]   What you're looking for is live HDMI out, live video out.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.040]   Which means that while the camera is on, you can see what's going on.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.320]   So then if I put that HDMI into this nice little Mac who gave me here...
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   How hard is that?
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.320]   It should see...
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.400]   Well, I don't know.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.000]   We'll see it as a camera to put in the sky.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.800]   It should see it as a camera to just put in the sky, yeah.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.760]   But you may already have...
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760]   But you may already have...
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.040]   I mean, if you take pictures at all, you probably have a point-and-shoot that might
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.040]   be able to do that.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.040]   You're looking for live HDMI.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040]   It just needs the HDMI video.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.240]   And you may need a battery with this power battery after.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.840]   The dummy battery, because...
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.720]   I was on tire to be in pink.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.280]   Well, what are you using right now?
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280]   The...
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.280]   The Logitech.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   Okay.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   It's not the...
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   That's not a bad camera.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   I don't know.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   I love this camera.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   I love this camera.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280]   I look great.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.280]   Because you look really great.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.760]   Easy for you to be better than looking than you are, Jeff.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.760]   I know.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.760]   I have to...
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.800]   No, I mean, I don't have to worry very much makeup at all.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.800]   I think it's a great camera.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.800]   Maybe you should.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   Maybe something wrong with Jeff.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800]   We don't know.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.920]   You know what I think the problem is?
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.080]   I think my hair causes a white balance problem.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.080]   I think I'm gonna be...
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.080]   Hey, wait.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.080]   Is there a...
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.080]   That's true.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.080]   Is there a...
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.080]   No, that's a good thought.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.080]   The camera is balancing on your hair.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.080]   I actually think...
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.080]   I don't know.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.520]   Why don't you dye your hair brown?
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.200]   Yeah, do it for us, Jeff.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.520]   You could be purple like Stacy's.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.520]   Jeff is like...
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.360]   I'm not purple.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.680]   Well, you were, weren't you, briefly?
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.680]   I was blue.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.680]   Blue.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.400]   You were four years, five years.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.360]   Not so briefly.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.920]   I felt like it was blowing the time.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:22.040]   Sorry, I dropped my worry bird, you guys.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.040]   What's your worry bird?
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.040]   Let me see that.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.040]   What is that?
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.040]   It's been a worry bird.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.800]   It's just a little wren that you squeeze.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.800]   Isn't...
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800]   You...
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800]   Is it gonna kill it?
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.720]   No, it's wood.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.400]   There's not much life left in it.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.160]   Oh, I'm thinking of mouse at mice and men.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.160]   It's dead George.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.160]   Yeah, and this is not a lenny.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.160]   It's not a lenny moment.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.400]   Can I ask you about a story?
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.320]   'Cause I don't subscribe to the information because I'm poor.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.400]   Yes, I have the information.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.280]   The Amazon story.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.880]   So Amazon Wal-Mart's to spend commerce marketing deals.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.880]   Is that affiliate sales that they're getting rid of?
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.880]   Like I can sell cameras on my blog or is that...
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]   Publishers...
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.880]   Publishers...
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.040]   Publishers are old or what is...
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.880]   I don't think so.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.960]   Publishers are bracing for a pullback and advertising amid a COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.680]   We've been speaking about that.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.120]   And one big shoe has already dropped.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:24.200]   Amazon and Wal-Mart have temporarily suspended commerce marketing deals with digital media
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.160]   firms such as Buzzfeed.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.560]   Okay, keep going.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:29.560]   What are the meetings?
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.560]   I mean, it is.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.560]   It's the paywall and I couldn't figure out what the...
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.680]   So I think it's affiliate links.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.160]   It is affiliate cheeses.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.160]   That's why I've been pushing publishers to do that as a whole new...
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:40.160]   It's a big deal.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.160]   Revenue stream.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:48.520]   Buzzfeed, according to this, the information gets 20% of its revenue from affiliate links.
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.520]   Ouch.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.760]   Half of it comes...
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   Well, okay, but only half of that.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.760]   So 10% comes for Amazon and Wal-Mart.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   So that's a 10% haircut.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.600]   Because Buzzfeed has its own bespoke products like Stowe.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.120]   With some deals, including the ones with Buzzfeed, the retailers, guarantee a minimum level
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.200]   of payment regardless of traffic.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.480]   So when I do an affiliate link, I get a percentage of the sales.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:15.680]   But apparently they've got a richer deal going with some of these guys.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:21.840]   They're guaranteeing a minimum level of payment.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.280]   That according to the information explains why Amazon and Wal-Mart have suspended payments.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   Now the publisher...
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.160]   So the other kick to the gonads for the news industry.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.160]   And Wal-Mart says, "We think it's going to be short-lived.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.260]   Once lockdowns ease in people's lives return to normal, the publisher says they're going
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.980]   to start buying things again."
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:45.440]   So I think that's the issue is that the affiliate revenues dwindled.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.880]   But the guarantees mean those payments have to keep up and they're just saying, "Look,
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.460]   we can't guarantee it.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:55.320]   We don't have such a deal, but we do affiliate links from time to time, I think."
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320]   So...
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.320]   Okay.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.800]   Thank you for that.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.000]   That's the story morning, Glory.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.640]   And that made it well worth buying the $400 a year subscription.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.640]   Very sad story.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:14.160]   And I do not know Jack Schofield, but I know many people do.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.840]   He was a diggardian.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:16.840]   Did you know him?
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.240]   Yeah, I think I met him a couple of times.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.080]   Yeah, he was the Guardian's tech guy.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.040]   Guardian is a great publication, theguardian.com.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.000]   He did the Ask Jack tech column.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.960]   He was kind of like their Wal-Mosper.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.960]   You.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960]   Wal-Mosper.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.040]   He started covering tech 35 years ago.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:43.800]   He had one of his first stories in 1983 was how to buy a home micro, which is what they
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.280]   call them in those days.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.720]   Probably he recommended the BBC Model B, the Acorn for 400 pounds or for 100 pounds
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.880]   the Sinclair Spectrum.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.680]   Those are great classic computers.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.880]   So he did not pass away of COVID though.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.040]   It was a heart attack, but he was only 72.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.640]   Insurf has COVID or is recovering from it?
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.640]   I saw that.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:14.680]   Very worrying because of course Vince, an older gentleman, the father of the internet responsible,
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.240]   kind of co-author some of the key protocols for the internet, including TCP.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.080]   Did you see whether he is seriously ill?
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.600]   I didn't think he was.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.840]   No, it doesn't sound like he is recovering.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:29.840]   He is recovering.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.920]   He will hope that that continues.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.920]   This is just the beginning.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.440]   This is the anticipatory grief.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.760]   This is just the beginning though.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:44.080]   I don't know if you watch the obituaries and CNN that Anderson does every night, but
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.320]   it's just devastating.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.880]   I shouldn't be watching it.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.400]   Nope, not going to watch that.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.560]   But I also feel like these people need to be remembered.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.200]   I will remember them later.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:08.120]   So speaking of the Guardian, their story astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:13.800]   coronavirus device caught my attention the other day.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.960]   Shall I read it to you?
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.960]   Oh, please do.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.400]   It is an excellent story, please.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:23.200]   An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.840]   up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.320]   the coronavirus outbreak.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:35.600]   Dr. Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at a Melbourne University, was building a necklace
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.280]   that sounds an alarm on facial contact when the mishap occurred last Thursday night.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.720]   The 27-year-old astrophysicist who studies pulsars and gravitational waves says he was
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:54.840]   trying to liven up the boredom of self-isolation with a four powerful neodymium magnets.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:59.240]   Stacy, how powerful are those neodymium magnets?
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240]   Very powerful.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.480]   They can rip your intestines too.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.480]   Cool.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.480]   You've heard it.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480]   They're really fun to play with.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:08.520]   But boy, when you put them close to each other, they go, "Bam!"
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:14.160]   He says, "I have some electronic equipment, but really no experience or expertise in building
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:16.000]   circuits or things.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000]   I had a part that detects magnetic fields.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.640]   I thought if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field and we wore magnets
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:30.600]   on our wrists, then it could set up an alarm if you brought it too close to your face."
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.760]   A bit of boredom and isolation made me think of that.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:39.280]   However, the Guardian goes on, the academic realized the electronic part he had did the
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.120]   opposite and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.120]   "I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzed continuously unless you moved your hand close
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.960]   to your face," he said.
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:58.760]   So after scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored playing with the magnets.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.720]   It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears, clothespins to your ears.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.840]   I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:14.720]   pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.720]   He said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils and two on the outside.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:25.240]   I was hoping I could get through this.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:32.120]   When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:42.000]   Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:51.840]   At this point, my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:58.480]   He said, "I was trying to pull them out, but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.400]   that you can't get past."
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.240]   After struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to google the problem.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.200]   There is his mistake right there.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.160]   I found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:17.360]   The solution in that was more magnets to put on the outside to offset the pull from the
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.520]   ones inside.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:23.120]   As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped onto each other
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.200]   and I lost my grip.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.280]   Those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right.
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:36.240]   At this point, I ran out of magnets.
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.000]   It was a good thing.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.760]   Before attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:51.200]   But they became magnetized by the magnets inside his nose.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:58.560]   Every time I brought the pliers to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards the pliers
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.560]   and then the pliers would stick to the magnet.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:10.560]   It was a little bit painful at this point, he reports.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.520]   My partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.520]   to laugh at me.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.760]   The doctors thought it was quite funny making comments like, "This is an injury due to self-isolation
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.480]   and boredom."
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.400]   At the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anesthetic spray and manually removed the
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.760]   magnets from Reardon's nose.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.520]   By the way, it's not over quite yet.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.880]   When they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat,
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.880]   he said.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.640]   "That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed a breathe in but I was thankfully
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.600]   able to lean forward and cough it out.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:58.560]   Needless to say, I am not going to play with the magnets anymore."
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   Is the greatest story, isn't it?
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.240]   So just a word of warning.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.200]   Kids, don't try this at home.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:10.200]   These are the same injuries that small children have playing.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.720]   They're very serious because again, if they swallow, they will rip through your intestines.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.120]   But for a grown astrophysicist.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.560]   Yeah, you should never let kids play with these super magnets.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.760]   They are really problematic.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.360]   Here's a picture just to complete the story.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   Here's a picture.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.160]   It is full humiliation.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:40.880]   You have Dr. Daniel Reardon in the hospital after removal of the magnets from his nose.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.080]   I give them a lot of points for confessing.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.160]   It is one of the funniest stories I've ever had.
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.880]   And then also they have the medical discharge summary.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.280]   To nice further magnets.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:01.360]   Two hours ago, had two neodymium, seven millimeter in diameter, strong magnets up bilateral nostrils
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:06.400]   stuck to each other via septum, bilaterally attempted removal, tried using two other magnets
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.880]   up left nostril, and with three magnets up left nostril, one upright all stuck together
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:22.360]   via septum, denies difficulty breathing, denies further magnets.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.360]   We needed that.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.360]   We did.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:30.440]   Let us, let us wrap things up with Stacy's pick of the week.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.440]   Stacy.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.440]   Oh, Stacy.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.440]   I have been this.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:36.880]   You are the only Stacy in the row.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.880]   Oh, Stacy.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.280]   Do you not have a pick?
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.160]   No, I don't have a pick.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:42.160]   It's okay.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.160]   I'm so sorry.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.160]   I can come up with a book I'm reading.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.160]   No, well, what are you reading?
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.160]   That's good.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.560]   Or, you know, it can be these days a TV show, a book, anything.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.560]   Honestly.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.320]   So I bought Ken Lou's, hold on, I'm going to tell you what it's called, girl.
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.320]   Girl hidden girl.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.320]   What is it called?
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.480]   So I love Ken Lou as a writer.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:09.760]   He wrote the paper tiger, which is a collection of short stories that was phenomenal.
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.760]   It's just really good.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]   I think it works up.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.680]   Does he work at Microsoft?
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.440]   He's very similar.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.520]   He's just, he's in the tech industry.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:25.000]   He writes very well about near term issues in short story, their science fiction stories.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.320]   So his new book is out or it was out last month, I don't remember, but I bought it and
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.240]   I just started reading it.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:38.520]   For those of you guys who like science fiction that is based in fact or could be plausible,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.680]   he's wonderful for that.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:45.600]   And this particular book is great because it's short stories and I don't know about you,
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.720]   but sometimes I have a hard time really like it's hard for me right now to dig into a
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.720]   novel and stay there.
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:57.280]   So I'm appreciative of the fact that I can escape for a little bit and then come back
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.280]   up and cook more food for my family because they're eating all the time.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.800]   Problem is right now life is a squirrel.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.640]   No, I was like, what?
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.760]   Well, it could be worse.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.640]   A big tiger king.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:17.800]   I think that honestly, this is one of the benefits of this reading, cooking, all of the humble
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.520]   things that we're doing, making face masks, I think are good.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.200]   I think it's not so bad.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.320]   It's hard, I understand.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:33.920]   And for a lot of people economically really bad, for others, health wise really bad.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.400]   So I don't want it anyway to diminish that.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.480]   But if the upshot of this is you get more cooking and reading time, that doesn't sound
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480]   so bad.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.840]   And I have a, we're having a lot of fun.
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:50.480]   I know I told, I tweeted about spraining my ankle.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:56.200]   I thought I had broken my foot playing just dance with my family, but it was just a sprain.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.200]   We were fine.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.200]   There are risks.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:06.600]   Here's Ken's website, by the way, it's kenlu.name.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.080]   And here's the hidden girl.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.040]   I appreciate book, I always appreciate book recommendations, always looking for new books.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.120]   Well, and if you haven't read it, the paper Menagerie has some wonderful stories.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.920]   There's a story about, it's very poignant.
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.320]   It's about somebody who works in a tech company.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:30.800]   His child died in basically recreating her in software and holograms.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.720]   And it was just so moving.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:33.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.720]   Anyway.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.720]   Thank you.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:39.120]   That's a perfectly legitimate recommendation.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.120]   Always welcome.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.040]   I read a lot.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.880]   And now Jeff, your pick of the week.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.600]   I'm gonna cheat like Stacy did.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   Um, there's a Stacy cheats I can cheat.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:02.280]   So the number is two as it takes two to make a couple, even in, even in this time of coronavirus,
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.720]   a drone can bring love together.
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:07.120]   Romance via drone.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:14.160]   It's a kind of nice little moron panda story of a guy who sees a woman in New York on the
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.120]   route across dancing.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:23.120]   Oh, and he says, he says a story about a quarantined cutie.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:26.800]   Not so sure about the cutie thing, but we'll give them a benefit of the doubt.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:30.600]   So she's over there and they kind of make eye contact.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:36.400]   And so he then gets a drone out and sends the drone over with his phone number.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.600]   Okay, Stacy, what do you think?
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.600]   Creepy.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:45.320]   I mean, does the drone have a camera?
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.960]   That's well, they're visible to each other.
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:53.040]   I could have wanted it up in a paper ball and thrown it.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.960]   No, they're across the street.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.120]   How would that sense of?
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.320]   Okay, could have put a rock in it.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.840]   Because a rock through your window is very creepy.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.160]   If you do it once and you acknowledge that it's a little over the edge, it's probably
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.080]   okay in this particular time.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.080]   It's cute.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.680]   And she could have just said, you know, thing is she could have had a drone jammer and then
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:16.120]   been like, shot it down.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.200]   That's the way you want to end the story because it's moral panic.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.200]   Yes.
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.680]   So he does that.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:25.000]   And then she texts them and they get along with the texting and then they have dinner
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000]   together each on their own roof.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]   Aw.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.440]   Which is kind of sweet.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.440]   That's sweet.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.800]   It may not be sweet after the quarantine.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.080]   No, it may not be at all.
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.080]   What if it smells bad?
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.080]   Right.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:42.080]   Well, it is a price.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.920]   Stacy, Stacy, you got a point in the story.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.720]   The first picture of him is without a shirt.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720]   Oh boy.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.880]   The problem.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.480]   I was talking to some professors the other night in a happy hour and they said they have
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.520]   they've had to tell a few people on where a shirt on.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.520]   Really?
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.520]   Why are people not wearing shirts?
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:05.520]   Is there a video conferences?
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.480]   Oh, those are like all those shirtless runners.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:11.400]   I don't see them appear because it's too cold.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.360]   We had a lot of those.
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360]   I don't like that.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.280]   I don't like that one cotton picking bit.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.120]   I mean, even if you look amazing, I feel like you should have.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.120]   It's not the right thing.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.120]   No, it's not the right thing.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.120]   Okay.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.120]   Well, actually there's quite a few drone stories.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.320]   I was just looking at USA Today.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:38.120]   There's the minister who married a couple from the fourth floor window via drone.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:46.680]   How could he just not stand six feet apart and just say, hey, because it's the earth.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:53.200]   Really the quarantine cutie is actually a TikTok thing.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:59.760]   So he's posting it on TikTok.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.840]   According to USA Today.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.480]   Eight million views on Twitter.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.520]   It's weird.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.400]   I don't really want to hate anybody who's in their own hamster ball, but that's just
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.240]   me.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:17.200]   It's a very modern story.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:18.440]   You can't acknowledge that.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:19.680]   I'm just going to I roll.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:21.160]   That was that's what you get there.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.080]   I know both of you have to do a lot of research.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.440]   And when I saw this, I thought of you.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.080]   Have you ever heard of Zotero?
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:36.720]   Oh, it's an it's an open source project, a research assistant in a box.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.320]   Mac windows are Linux as you're you can copy research.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:47.640]   It'll actually automatically pull the article from J store or what is it?
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.520]   Archive.com.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.040]   You can scan ISBN numbers.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.040]   It will automatically pull in the references.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:59.320]   When it creates an automatic quick bibliography, Chicago or MLA style.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.800]   Your choice.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.520]   It supports over a bit.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.440]   It's really what a great thing.
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.280]   It supports over 9000 citation styles.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.120]   I didn't even know there were 9000.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.440]   I know it's they're awful.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.440]   That's great.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:15.040]   This is why I didn't go into an academic career right there.
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.040]   Bibliographies.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.160]   I like it because it's free.
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.160]   It's open.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.160]   It's easy.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.400]   You could buy storage from them or you can run it yourself.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:23.240]   Looks like I just thought I thought of you.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.320]   I just thought of you guys when I saw it.
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.520]   I don't do research.
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:27.520]   I don't need a reason.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.520]   It's cool.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.520]   As you could tell with my weather story.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.280]   I don't research.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.360]   So I my research is basically like clipping things into a Google keep document.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360]   That's what this is.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.800]   Yeah, that's kind of what this is.
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.800]   So you have a central store for all of that.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.960]   Mine is Google keep.
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:51.520]   I used to have folders where I would print things out, which then felt very serial killer.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.320]   Yeah, you don't want a big stack of paper.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:57.400]   Z-O-T-E-R-O dot org.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.320]   And that concludes this.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.520]   I thought it was a very nice addition.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:02.520]   And actually one.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.720]   A fireside addition with a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.840]   Any something sad, something poignant.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.240]   We need each other.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.280]   We like to hang out with each other.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:18.880]   We do this show Wednesday's 130 Pacific 430 Eastern.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.880]   That's 2030 UTC.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.440]   The live stream is at twit.tv/live as with all of our streams.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.480]   In fact, we stream 24/7.
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.320]   So even if there's not a show being produced at any given time, there'll be something going
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.680]   on at that channel.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.560]   Audio or video, twit.tv/live.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:42.360]   And demand versions of the show nicely trimmed and edited and all that are available at twit.tv/twig,
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:46.120]   twit.tv/twig, or on YouTube.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:50.000]   Or you can ask your assistant, you could say, "Hey, goog.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.960]   Play that this week in Google Podcasts."
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:55.640]   And it'll likely play it.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:59.040]   You never really know what'll happen.
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.480]   But we do watch you to listen.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:02.480]   And we also would love you to subscribe.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.480]   That way you'll have it automatically.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.040]   You don't have to go through this rigor, Marole.
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:07.240]   Just find your favorite podcast app.
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:11.320]   Subscribe and you'll get it the minute it's available on a Wednesday evening.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.200]   Thank you so much, Stacey Higginbotham.

[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:21.920]   She's at Gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:23.480]   You still love the Twitter?
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.160]   I still love the Twitter.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:28.240]   I'm posting my bread experiments there.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.640]   Plus any fun things that I see.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.640]   Oh, nice.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.640]   Yum.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:33.640]   Yeah.

[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:39.000]   He's also indeed to a fault.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:46.640]   A blogger at buzzmachine.com and a regular at the City University of New York at the Craig
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:52.000]   Newmark's broadcast, School of Churchill and Scratch with school.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000]   Yes.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.200]   School of Broadcasting websites.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.000]   Not affiliate with CBS.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.720]   Remember that?
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.720]   The Columbia School of Broadcasting.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:03.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.440]   I always had to say, not affiliated with CBS.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.440]   Thank you.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.840]   I did not go to the Columbia School of Broadcasting, by the way.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:12.440]   I'm not affiliated with CBS either.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:13.440]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.960]   We will see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:24.080]   And as we have to say now, from now on, stay safe, wash your hands and go home.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.080]   Snort maggots.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.080]   No, don't snort.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.080]   What?
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.080]   No.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.080]   Don't snort them.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.080]   Don't snort them.
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:31.080]   Don't snort them.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:31.080]   Very important.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:37.200]   (guitar music)
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.780]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.780]   You
