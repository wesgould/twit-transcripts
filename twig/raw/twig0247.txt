[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.500]   The show that covers the Google verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   And because it's the Bard's 450th anniversary, the Shakespeare verse.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gina Tarpani of smarterware.org and think up!
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   Hi Gina.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   English major really appreciated that joke.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500]   Hello, good to be here.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   Nice to have you and Jeff Jarvis who teaches professionally.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   As a professor of journalism at the City University of New York CUNY.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   He is also the author of Public Parts and what would Google do?
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   Hello, Jeffrey.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   I guess this is actually an interesting story.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   It has nothing to do with Google or anything but does have to do with Shakespeare.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   The 450th anniversary of Shakespeare was born, we perhaps think April 23rd, 1564 a week
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   ago, St. George's Day.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   It was baptized on the 26th, so I say we'll just honor that.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   But what's kind of fun is somebody from Daily News Gems reached out, Bill Lucy reached
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   out to a bunch of people on Twitter saying what's your favorite Shakespeare quote?
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   Tina Brown said a little touch of Harry in the night.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500]   Ooh!
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   Ooh!
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   Ooh!
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   You go girl.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   I don't know what that means.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   Well her husband's name is Harry.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   Ah, I didn't know that, see?
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   That would be my favorite.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   That's very good from Hank Sank, Henry V.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   The obvious one from Richard as a Venice.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   Chris Matthews said the quality of mercy is not strained.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   It dropped as a gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   Patrick Buchanan said we few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   From Henry V also.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   Henry V is a good one for quotes.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   As Ershorth would get extra points, if he had said let's kill the lawyers first.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   Kill them, kill them, kill the lawyers first.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   Sam Tana House, American historian and writer at large from the New York Times.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   It's more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   I have to think about that one.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   No, fool, oh I changed the whole meaning of the sentence.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   That fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.140]   Alan Dershowitz, our doubts, our traitors, and make us lose the good we often might win by
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.500]   fearing to attempt.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   I like that for measure for measure.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.100]   David Ignatius, author of Body of Lies, columnist for the Post, "Men must endure their going
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.500]   hence even as they are coming hither."
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   Rightness is all.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   That's from King Lear.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   I don't know.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   You want to know what Kara Swisshers was?
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   Yeah, she regretted it.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   She said on Twitter.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   Yeah, that's the one she regretted.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   I wasted time and now doth time waste me.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   For now hath time made me his numbering clock.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   My thoughts are minutes in with size, they jar.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   Where to my finger like a dial's point is pointing still,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   in cleansing them from tears.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is, our clamorous groans would strike up on my
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   heart, which is the bell so size and tears and groans show minutes, times and hours.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   You are a good Shakespearean.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   You're a large Shakespeare.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   You are.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   Leo as King Lear.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   I will do Lear.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   Actually that's from Richard II.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   This is Kara's quote.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   This is the quote I would have picked for her.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   Though she be but little, she is fierce.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   There you go.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   This summer's night dream.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   Nice.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   That's what I'm going to show.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   That's why she regrets it.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   She knew there was better.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   She says I really picked a depressing Shakespeare quote.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   That's fun.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Anyway, happy birthday to the Bard.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   This is the Bard of Avon.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   So we covered this morning at 10 a.m.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   and you can see it in our TNT episode for this week with Mike Elgin.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   And a couple of people from, writer from Forbes, whose name escapes me.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   Shoot.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   And from 9 to 5, Max Zach somebody.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   We covered the, I'm sorry.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   And I'm always telling Mike, Mike, you got to tell us everybody's name so we know where
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   you're talking.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   I forgot.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   We covered fate, F8, the Facebook Developers Conference.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   First one in three years.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   Although they did say that we will now do this from now on every year.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   That they're probably watching how Apple and Google do their developer conferences and
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   realizing how important Microsoft do, how important these events are.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   And especially this one because Facebook essentially, I believe, has decided, there you go.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   Parmie Olson of Forbes and Zach Hall of 9 to 5, Max.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   Right there in the show notes.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   Sorry about that, Parmie and Zach.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   It's age.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   Parmie and Zach.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   It's not.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   It's surely age.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   It's not that you're unmemorable.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   I can testify the same way.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   It's that time doth fly in seconds and minutes and groans.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:03.020]   I think that they, I believe, and I think Mike Elgin had the insight this week and posted
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.060]   this in his computer world piece, that these companies, particularly Facebook, Realize,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.900]   but Google certainly started it, that the way to success lies not in making a webpage
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.140]   that everybody wants to go to.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.140]   I mean, I think Yahoo learned this very early on.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.140]   The portal is dead.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.540]   No, but I still haven't learned it.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.060]   But yeah, we're still learning it.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.980]   But in fact, to create a bunch of attractive honeypots, if you will, Google Docs, Google
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:38.660]   Voice, Google+, apps across all platforms, and then unite them across a common ad platform.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   And so you gather data.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.140]   And this is what Google really has been doing from the, from the beginning, you gather data
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.900]   from all of these little flowers and you bring it back to the home office and you make honey
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.540]   and then advertisers, advertisers across it all.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.460]   You know everything and you've got a great platform.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.260]   And key to that, Leo, and I've been thinking about this too is a lesson when I hear it,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.540]   when I hear people in my business say, mobile first, we got to be mobile.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.420]   Well, what they think is they build another bloody portal.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.020]   And when Zuckerberg said to Farhadmaju that he was breaking up the big blue app, I think
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.580]   we talked about this last week a little bit and doing everything.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.860]   I mean, I thought about Google and the point of it is that Google is not thinking like
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.860]   a brand first, it's thinking like a user first.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.380]   So if I want to get somewhere, I go use ways.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.660]   If I want to communicate in email, I go to Gmail.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.860]   If I want to search for something, I go to search there are appropriate contexts for
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.860]   my needs.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.860]   It's not that they're trying to create 25 cool apps.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.460]   It's they're trying to do things that are appropriate for what a user wants at that moment.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.820]   And so Facebook's going the same way.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.740]   That's why I don't think that Facebook's bothered about trying to integrate what's that
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.420]   because what's happens at different functions.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.740]   So you go there for that Instagram is a different function.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.940]   You go there for that, which you're right.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.740]   Then you then you have a relationship with a person across all those platforms and that
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.940]   gives you the opportunity for targeting and advertising and all that wonderful good stuff,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.580]   which we in media don't understand still.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.020]   And in fact, it's very interesting because it also gives you the capability and Zuckerberg
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.180]   was it pains to say this to that you can say, okay, you can be anonymous.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.380]   So Facebook connects, you know, that's the big blue button.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.940]   You say, you know, sign in via Facebook and a lot of apps use it, a lot of websites use
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.940]   it.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.020]   You can say and we'll say sign in, you'll have sign in via Facebook that'll let everybody
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.660]   know your personality who you are or sign in anonymously.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.260]   But as someone pointed out in Twitter today, I forget who it was, Facebook will still know
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.260]   what you did.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.100]   You're only anonymous to the web site.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.460]   Only anonymous to the developer of the third party app.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.460]   Right.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.460]   Yeah, that's not so cool.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.460]   Well, and I think it's a it's a spin, isn't it?
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.020]   Because you really, I mean, it still works just as well for Facebook, maybe even better
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.260]   because Facebook owns the relationship now.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.900]   And that's that's not so cool for the app developer.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.700]   A app developer.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.860]   And that's going to be the challenge, isn't it?
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.300]   Yeah, I mean, the benefit of using something like Facebook Connect is that, you know, users
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.900]   don't want to have to create another username and email address and password, right?
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.540]   They could just log in and it's and it's easier.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.860]   It's an easier user experience, easier onboarding, which third party, small apps, new apps need
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.860]   desperately, right?
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.860]   And that's what Facebook Connect offers.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.060]   I mean, and but part of the offering is, hey, I can get this person's email address
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.460]   without asking them to type it in, which is annoying, particularly on mobile.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.100]   So I was thinking about log in anonymously, which hasn't launched, by the way, this is
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.780]   something that's going to happen eventually, right?
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.100]   It's not just talked about it.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.260]   Talked about it today.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.900]   You know, what do you get as an app developer?
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.060]   Do you just get you get a token?
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060]   Okay.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.540]   So the user still has to enter, you know, email address.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.660]   I mean, as an app developer, I need some way to communicate with the user.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.180]   It's generally through an email address or if your mobile app push notifications, I guess,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.780]   or your phone number.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.620]   But yeah, no, this definitely benefits Facebook and it benefits users.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.300]   So that's a good thing.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.180]   But, um, well, but that's so now so you're right.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.420]   So Facebook has to come up with some sweeteners and they came up with a couple.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.020]   The first thing they said is we're going to keep our API solid and consistent for a minimum
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.700]   of two years.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.020]   We are we want to be solid, reliable.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.860]   We want to be a platform that you trust and in order to get you to participate, not only
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.460]   will we give you connect with your users want, but we'll also give you things like parse.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.820]   We'll give you under, we'll give you the tools for very affordable price, presumably for
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.660]   data, the database that you need.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.500]   A lot of the things that you want in your app that would cost you money or that you would
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:39.060]   have to develop will now give you an entire developer platform and an ad platform.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.180]   And that's the come on, isn't it?
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.220]   Even our universe will make it easy for you.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.380]   We'll make it easy for your users.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.660]   Your users will be happy.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.260]   The trade off is, you know, if you want more information, you'll have to ask for it.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.180]   By the way, people do that right now with Facebook Connect.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.420]   It's a little annoying for me.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   They say connect with Facebook.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   You connect and they say, now create a user account with the past.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.420]   Yes.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.420]   That irritates the hell out of me.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   But that's why.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420]   And that's going to you're going to see more of that, right?
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420]   Right.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.940]   So now now the advantage of using Facebook and that goes away.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.420]   So, so this is the question whether whether as an app developer is Google sign in going
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.420]   to be better.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:18.540]   Well, Facebook is, oh, giving you all this much more control over privacy, which may be
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540]   a good argument.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.540]   What do you think?
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.540]   Right.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.460]   I mean, on the mobile side, you know, Google sign in is way easier, particularly on Android
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.860]   because it's just because you're absolutely logged in to your Google account on Android,
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.860]   multiple Google accounts.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.700]   You just choose the one that you want and you're in.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.580]   And I'm not sure how it's implemented on iOS, but I think it's a similar thing.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.500]   I think I think that you're logged into the suite of apps.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.340]   You know, yeah.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.340]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.900]   Whereas with Facebook, now look, Facebook has incredibly usage on mobile.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.780]   So presumably maybe you are already logged in to, you know, to Facebook, but it's, I
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.300]   mean, coming from my perspective, which is someone who doesn't use Facebook as much
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.780]   and who's kind of Android focused, I would go with Google login first because it is the
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.460]   most seamless login experience for a native mobile mobile app.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.900]   By the way, on Android, no, it's not Google plus login anymore.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.460]   It's the Google login.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.460]   Is that confirmed?
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.700]   Well, the rumor is well, we should we should talk about that.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.580]   Okay, we should talk about Google plus and then get to that.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.580]   Believe me.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.060]   Oh, we're going to get there.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   Don't you worry.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.420]   You're a little sweet little head about that, dear.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.180]   No, no, we'll definitely be talking about that.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.420]   But I want to, I just wanted to get the Facebook F8 stuff here.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.820]   They also launched a new mobile ad network called Facebook audience.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.940]   And Mark winded up the proceeds in a very Larry, I thought it was a Larry page.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:45.100]   We're going to call these Larry pages now where the CEO comes back on stage after the keynote
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:51.540]   as Larry did last year at Google ID IO and says a final word about who we are and what
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.380]   we mean and what we do.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.620]   Now Larry went on and on and he talked about an island and he answered questions from Scoble
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.100]   and it probably wasn't as on point as it could be.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:08.060]   Mark was very on point and he basically said that we are going to make our customer first
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:14.740]   focus be the focus of what we do as much as hacker, you know, as we consider ourselves
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.900]   hackers, we're going to consider ourselves serving the customer.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   And then he ended with that.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.100]   And I think that that's a message not just to the lot, the audience watching in and the
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:32.140]   developers in the conference, but as much to Facebook employees, customer first.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.420]   And I think that there's an acknowledgement.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   Go ahead.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.460]   Is that attention with move fast and break things?
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.300]   I think there's a there's a there's a natural tension there.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.780]   Well, that's why he deprecated move fast and break things right at the beginning.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.300]   He put move fast and break things right in the top there and he said, no, because we
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.260]   want to give you a stable and consistent platform.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.500]   Well, that's a big change.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.380]   Well, and it makes sense move fast and break things is great for apps, but not for the
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.380]   platform.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.140]   You want the platform to be rock solid.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.380]   Well, let me ask this Leo because you know, they made a great big deal.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.900]   You know, now God, five years ago about we were killing a lot of our apps were opening
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.220]   the platform, developers, developers, developers, we love developers.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.980]   And then much of the apps that people couldn't get any attention for the apps and developers
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980]   just went away.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.580]   So are they trying to say developers, you're welcome back?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   Yes.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.420]   What's the relationship of Facebook to a developer now because because like Twitter, I think
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.940]   if I were developer and I and I put a lot of effort into something on Facebook or Twitter,
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.940]   I'd feel burned.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.300]   I have to right.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.460]   But this is the opposite, isn't it?
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.420]   I have to say Mark has shown a real great willingness to to change his mind.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.540]   For instance, remember, he was pushing HTML5 as the app platform.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540]   Yep.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.540]   And then they said that was a big mistake.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.260]   And they said bye bye.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.140]   He moved fast, he moved fast and break things in our own leadership.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.140]   In his own, yeah.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.900]   And that I respect that.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.900]   I respect that.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.620]   Though it does make you wonder, you know, what's what's it going to be at F8 next year?
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.700]   I think a Neil tweeted earlier kind of some of the things that were announced at previous
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.500]   F8s that are just not around anymore at all.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   Go fast.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   Right.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.700]   I think this is a redefinition of what he sees as Facebook and I think he's actually right.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.980]   And I think Google pioneered this idea and that, you know, they continue to acquire apps.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.580]   But now he's saying we don't even have to acquire apps.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.660]   If you're an app developer, develop to our platform and you'll be part of the family.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.740]   Again, he said that before.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.860]   And then I'm not going to open the graph launch.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.500]   He was wrong or right before or wrong or right now.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.180]   I'm just trying to understand what's the difference in the attitude toward developers from five
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.140]   years ago, it was opened up and then apps went into obscurity.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.060]   And so what is it they expect now from developers versus what they expected the last time they
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.940]   opened up?
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.980]   He closed out by saying this.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.780]   Here's the quote I was looking for the quote.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.580]   We have this really strong hacker culture at Facebook and it's helped us grow.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.420]   But it's really been focused on us.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.820]   Instead, we want to instill a culture of loving the people we serve as strong as our hacker
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.780]   culture, if not stronger.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.540]   It's an honor to serve you in our mission.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.260]   Now the cynics will say, yeah, thanks Mark.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.260]   But maybe he's sincere.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260]   I feel like he's as sincere as Larry Page was.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.420]   Oh, I think he's sincere.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   I just try to understand.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.780]   It's a big paradigm shift.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.780]   That's what I think.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.060]   I think it's a massive paradigm shift.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.500]   So a tremendous paradigm shift.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   And I think he's saying that.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.260]   He's saying we used to, he started off saying we used to have this famous mantra, move fast
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.900]   and break things.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.420]   That's mentality made sense in a startup, but we're 10 years old and we need to be a
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.540]   platform now and we have to be stable and consistent, stable and consistent.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.500]   I think it's smart.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.460]   I think this is, but I think the lesson is learned from Google.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.060]   And I think if you're Facebook that you see a brave new world, you're an ad network.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.660]   You're acknowledging what you have been on along.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.980]   It doesn't have to be invented here.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   Well, this is also part of the breaking up.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.140]   I guess here's the difference.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.620]   Okay, maybe try this on.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   Here's the difference.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:11.420]   The first time they opened up, they said, feel free to write apps on to into as part of Facebook.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.420]   And your son, Jake, Jake was a big developer on that.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.540]   He wrote it and sold it for a pretty penny.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.820]   Now I think what they're saying is, no, no, we're breaking up the big blue app, as he
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.820]   said.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.140]   So feel free to use our API to write new apps on top like paper.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.220]   That's exactly what he's saying.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220]   That's the difference.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.220]   Okay.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220]   Now I understand.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.980]   And he said, and more than that, he said, we learned how to massively scale a network
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.220]   back end.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.740]   We have 1.2 billion users.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.380]   And we can handle it and you can use this.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.380]   We're offering you this platform.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.020]   And boy, do we know how to serve 1.2 billion users?
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.340]   You know, it would be smart for them.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.100]   We were talking a little bit about this to go out and buy and pay some sort of mobile
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.940]   payment platform instead of creating their own and acquire a bunch of users in the developing
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:03.340]   world who use their phone as a bank.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.940]   They're already using WhatsApp.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   Right.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.860]   They could use a Facebook wallet.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.700]   I think there's a huge opportunity here.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700]   I really do.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.420]   I think Google knows this.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.540]   They were smart enough to realize it.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:24.260]   Yeah, particularly with Facebook's numbers and non-US and Canada countries.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:31.460]   They have to get people to trust them, non-trivial, as Google has also learned.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.460]   They have to get developers to buy in.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.380]   Well, and this story we'll probably talk about later, but there's a lesson in here I
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.020]   think, too, from Twitter.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.700]   And we'll get to that story later about Twitter's slow growth.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:52.340]   But I do wonder whether if Twitter had kept an open attitude with developers and had developed
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.940]   outside of itself on an API, would it be bigger now than it is?
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.780]   Would it still be growing faster than it is?
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.900]   I'll tell you what, I just love this space.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.300]   And I love covering this space.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.740]   It's an intellectual exercise every month.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.740]   It is.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.740]   Well, here's the other one.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.380]   By the way, would Google+ be bigger if they'd ever done the rewrite API?
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.180]   Well, let's talk about that.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.180]   That is interesting.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.180]   That's interesting.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   And is it over for Google+?
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.180]   Condautra says goodbye.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.860]   The untold story of Larry Page's incredible comeback.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.980]   And what happened to Twitter?
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   All coming up.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.740]   I want to talk about also Google's change luck.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.340]   We'll do that in just a second.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.900]   But first, I want to tell you about this.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.460]   Wouldn't it be cool if all of the printers that you deal with day to day could handle
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.020]   Google+ print?
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.660]   Google+ Cloud print is so cool.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.820]   I love Cloud print.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.540]   If you have a Cloud print enabled printer, you could print from anywhere, from your phone,
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.500]   from your laptop to any printer that's Cloud enabled at home or at work.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.100]   But a lot of older printers, maybe your printer just isn't compatible with Google Cloud print.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.220]   It must be a little bit frustrating, right?
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   I want to print to this printer and it doesn't understand it.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.420]   Well, here's a way to do it affordably and very easily.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.140]   This is-- yeah, we've talked about the Lantronics folks before.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.500]   Their XPrint server, they have an air print version that works with Apple devices.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.460]   This is their new Cloud print edition.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.940]   You plug in almost any printer.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.060]   And it suddenly, it allows wireless mobile printing from your Chromebook, from your Android
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.420]   device, from your iPhone, even from the Kindle Fire.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.740]   And it will work with the printer you already own, wired or wireless USB or network.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.380]   It's the first and only print server officially certified by Google for Cloud print and Android
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.380]   printing.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.380]   It prints to your existing printers.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.300]   You don't have to buy a new one, more than 4,000 top brand printers.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.940]   It literally turns it into a wireless printer.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.260]   And it's easy.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.900]   You might think you have to download or-- no, you just open it up, plug it in and print.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.820]   It's got a web interface for advanced configuration, but I can tell you right now, in my experience,
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.820]   you don't need to do anything.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.500]   You just plug it in.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.460]   It automatically discovers all the printers on your network.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.020]   It says you want to make these Cloud print and you say, yeah, that's it.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   This is such a great idea.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:14.180]   If you've got a USB printer that you currently have to plug into, suddenly it's Wi-Fi enabled.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.100]   It'll work on your network.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.860]   It even works with large multi-function printers, pretty much any printer.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:26.180]   $149.95 for up to 10 network printers and eight USB printers simultaneously.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.260]   People use these in schools and offices.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:34.180]   You plug this one thing in and boom, you're working.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.660]   Visit xprintserver.com/twit for more information and to get yourself one.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.900]   In fact, when you use the offer code Twit, you'll get free shipping on your order.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:49.820]   xprintserver.com/twent the new xprint server Cloud print edition from Landtop Electronics.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820]   I want that now.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   Isn't it great?
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.460]   Yeah, because you're a Chromebook guy, right?
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.460]   I'm a Chromebook guy, man.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.460]   That's perfect for me.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.460]   I need that.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.700]   Basically, my Mac does two things in life.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.340]   This show and it's a print server.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   All right.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.340]   Good news.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.340]   That's all it does anymore.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.340]   Send one to the, we'll send one to post-taste.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   No, I'm going to get it.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.340]   We'll send it to you.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.340]   We got a few lying around.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   That's cool.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.340]   It's great, isn't it?
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.340]   It's 10 printers, huh?
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.340]   That's great.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.380]   I talked with a, we got an email from a teacher who was using the Apple version.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.220]   She was responsible for running the network in the school, as always.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.420]   There was nobody in charge of it, so she was in charge of it.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.100]   She said, "I couldn't believe that I plugged it in.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.220]   All of our printers were suddenly air print compatible.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.100]   We were printing, the students are printing and stuff.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.940]   If you've got Chromebooks, this is a huge thing."
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.500]   Hey, let's do, well, let's not delay it.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.100]   Sometimes we delay it and I regret it.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   Let's not delay it.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   Let's do it right now.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.060]   Ladies and gentlemen, break out the horns.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   The Google change law.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   Time.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:54.580]   And now here's Gina Terpani with the latest.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.380]   Google released iOS apps for Google Docs and Google Sheets.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.140]   The apps run the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and they let you create and open and edit documents
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.220]   that you started on the web.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.540]   You could share it with other users.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.100]   You can work offline.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.540]   You can add and respond to comments with Sheets.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.340]   You can format cells, enter sort data.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.420]   Everything is saved automatically as you type.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.660]   Both of those apps are available for free in the iOS app store right now.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.460]   How different is it from just using the Drive app?
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.820]   You know, I haven't actually had a chance to try these out.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.820]   I think it's just a much more native, better native experience than the Drive app.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.780]   And slides are not available yet, but they are coming soon.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.780]   Cool.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.300]   I left my iPhone at home.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.740]   Speaking of Google Drive, Google Drive can now cast presentations to the Chromecast.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   That's cool.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.460]   Yeah, it's really cool, right?
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.300]   So this only works on the desktop right now.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.540]   So to cast a presentation, there is a present button in the top right corner of a Google
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.820]   Drive document.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.380]   If you have the Chromecast extension installed, you have to have the Chromecast extension installed,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.860]   but you do, if you have a Chromecast.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.860]   You just see the option to present on another device.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.100]   And from here, you can select which device to cast to.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.260]   Really, really, really nice.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.900]   So just skip the projector and plug it right into the TV.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.020]   I like that a lot.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:19.340]   Let's see, Google Glass updates Field Trip, which is the app that tells you what's going
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.060]   on or gives you information about things in your world.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.340]   Is integrated into Google Glass.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.060]   We knew that, but now it's voice integrated into Google Glass.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.820]   So Glass Wears can say, "Explore nearby."
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.980]   It's one of the main core Glass Voice commands.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.860]   And Field Trip will show the wearer interesting facts about the world that surrounds them as
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.820]   they walk.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.140]   And Glass is also getting another much needed feature.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.580]   I was pretty excited about this.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.700]   Field Trip is pretty cool.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.620]   But now the Glass will have smarter phone answering.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:54.780]   So Glass will know if they're not on your head to ring your phone and not your glasses,
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.900]   which I can't tell you how many times I've had my glasses ring because it was Bluetooth
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.140]   connected to my phone when a phone came in.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.460]   So your Glass would ring and not your phone?
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.460]   Not your phone, yeah.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.580]   So I hear my phone ringing and, yeah, you have to grab your phone and switch it to phone.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.620]   So some nice Glass updates there.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.460]   Google Search now lets you filter restaurants by what's open now, price, and more.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.100]   So using Google Search on the web, yeah, this is really nice.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.140]   On the web or on Android, the Search app, you can filter restaurant search results.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.060]   So if you go to Google and you search for, you know, show me some restaurants in downtown
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:33.020]   Austin, related searches, you can filter by how expensive, what kind of cuisine, if
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.820]   it's open right now, the Zagit rating, which is very, very helpful.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.900]   So do your Google searches for restaurants?
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.740]   You know what I really, really want?
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   What?
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   What tell me what you want?
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.740]   I'll tell you what I want a lot of things.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.740]   Don't get me started.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.420]   Do I try myself?
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.020]   When I'm driving from here to there, I want to be able to say Starbucks on the way.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.100]   Yeah, that seems sensible.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.740]   That seems like a small thing to ask for.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   It really does.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.540]   And you know, especially in ways, I have a destination.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.420]   It knows what roads I'm taking and I, you know, find me the next Starbucks.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.820]   Yeah, or find you.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   I've seen this.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.820]   Yeah, or gas station.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.580]   In some GPS apps, you can do an intermediate stop.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.580]   Really?
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.620]   Oh, because, because usually it's just the nearest and you're, you know, you're between
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.260]   20 miles between exits and it doesn't matter that there's a Starbucks two miles away because
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.260]   you'd have to.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.460]   Chats, Chad says he wants to.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.540]   How do I get gas on the way button?
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   Always.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.900]   It does mean that there is.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.900]   They don't.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.020]   Yeah, there needs to be a, there needs to be a, you know, pit stop option because yeah,
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.180]   either you have to redo a complete new navigation and sometimes I've already chosen a different
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.060]   navigation and you have to choose.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.060]   I find it annoying.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.540]   My car's always saying you're out of gas.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   You're out of gas.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.740]   Where do you want to see gas stations?
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.740]   No.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.540]   I want to keep driving.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.980]   Are you one of those horrible people that drives down the fumes?
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.980]   Yep.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.020]   You're also one of those horrible people that also appears two minutes before the flight
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.020]   takes off.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.660]   If possible.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.780]   Sometimes that's not always easy to do.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.180]   But I try.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.580]   I like to walk in that plane as they're closing the door.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.380]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.340]   I'm there two hours ahead.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.140]   My mother made me erotic as hell.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.580]   I feel like this, this has a lot.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.980]   This says I'm learning a lot about you.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.580]   Five years later, I feel like this is indicative.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.580]   I look like you, Gina.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.940]   Are you the-- I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.060]   I aspire to be Jeff, but in reality, I'm Leo.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.300]   I come late, but I'm like, harried and freaked out.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.220]   You know, I'm late because, yeah.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.300]   I'm always late for everything.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.900]   I just show up late.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.220]   You're the only TV network on Earth that doesn't give a crap about the clock.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.900]   And I'm proud of that.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.060]   Even though it drives our audience crazy.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.060]   I don't know.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.060]   Drives them crazy.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.380]   And I don't want to drive our audience crazy.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.740]   I should do a Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:06.980]   We built this station on the notion that no show should start on time, but now we want
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.260]   to take care of you, our audience.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.660]   I'm pretty much never ready to start right at four, so I'm really glad.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.060]   Like, to consult for me.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.060]   Yeah, see, you and I.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.140]   This is actually the week after the next one.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.860]   I'm going out to Google for it to do a privacy talk, right?
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:25.020]   The next Wednesday morning, I either fly back and I think I would land at 230 at Newark.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.020]   And I live 20 minutes away from Newark Airport.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:33.820]   So I'm now the Leo would say, no, swap, right?
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.860]   Jeff would say, hmm, I'm usually home at least an hour before the show.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   Something could go wrong.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.740]   Then I'll be really nervous and I can't tell you because I'm in the air.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.180]   Maybe I'll stay two more days just so I can be on the show.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.420]   You should have on Google now, like a setting for that.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.660]   What kind of person are you a Jeff or a Jeff?
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.660]   It's an erosus slide.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   I don't know.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   Yes, yes.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   Slider.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.180]   I play, you know, it's 15 minutes past shows time and Skype's like, hey, do you want to
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.180]   install updates?
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.180]   I'm like, what could go wrong?
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.180]   Like, oh, I did that too.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.180]   Yes.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.180]   Guys, Jack crazy.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.180]   Yeah, let me just update Mac the Mac right now.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   It's not just right or no, it's not absolutely big.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.180]   I do it in shows.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:22.580]   Actually, I was so proud because I flew to Colorado to see my son on Thursday last.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.340]   And I arrived just as the boarding began for my row.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.260]   Like I like walked in.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.060]   That's what I want.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   I'm so proud that I am now.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.340]   Here's how ironic I am.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.940]   I'm now global services on United.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.980]   We go on before the pilots.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.900]   We go on the first, right?
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.860]   And it's that horrible moment when I used to hate those people that say, excuse me,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.420]   excuse me, I'm global services.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.420]   Let me throw it.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.420]   Oh, I hate those people.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.420]   I don't.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.300]   But even though I know I can be the first to war, I don't have to line up.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.580]   I still show up early.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.580]   Good man.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.580]   Because I'm neurotic.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.580]   It's a role.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:07.260]   It's I really do aspire to be that person who's like, you know, on time and quaffed and,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.860]   you know, prepared and I'm, you know, I'm always the one that's like, ah, my hair is wet.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.060]   Well, now that your mom is even worse, you're probably even worse, right?
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.060]   Oh, forget it.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.060]   Absolutely.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.060]   It's true.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   At a screws you up there.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060]   Because anything can happen with the baby.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.380]   I didn't know this, but apparently Wednesday is app update day at Google land.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.380]   Did you know that?
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.020]   I noticed I noticed that Android police had said something like, hey, it's Wednesday.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.700]   So things things get updated.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.660]   So I just assumed it was Twig Day.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.180]   So Google dropped their updates, you know, just in time for us.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.180]   I like this.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.180]   I like this a lot.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:48.140]   The truth of of of whether it's Twig Day or not is whether they listen to us by like,
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.940]   oh, oh, yeah, anybody.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.740]   Well, we'll get to that next.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.740]   Yes.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.740]   Yes, they did.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740]   They did.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   Yes.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.380]   Yes, still working on it, but this, but someone did.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.380]   So it worked.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.380]   Thank you.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.380]   Go ahead.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.380]   Yes.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.380]   Yes.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.380]   But first we're going to tell you where you parked.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.380]   Yes.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.580]   Last item in the change log.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.420]   And we talked about that this might happen.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.020]   This is actually happening.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.860]   Google will now remember where you parked.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.380]   And I believe this happens automatically.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.420]   This is a Google now feature.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.060]   Google updated search app and that update is rolling out right now.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.020]   Basically, new card detects when you've stopped driving.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.020]   Love that.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.020]   This is where you parked.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.580]   And if you want to get that, the APK is rolling out now.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.780]   If you want to get it right now, you can go to Android Police.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.340]   They've got manual downloads.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.260]   You can sideload the APK if you want.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.780]   I haven't had a chance to actually try this out.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.900]   I believe that it happens just completely automatically, which is sort of the beauty
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   of Google now.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   I just love that.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.900]   I just love that.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.900]   It's amazing.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.900]   It's great.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.900]   It's pretty great.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:50.020]   I was, you know, earlier when we were talking about Facebook and apps, I was thinking about
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:55.340]   how Google now, like both Facebook and Google now, Google, even though they want to spread
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.900]   the love across different apps, there's still that core experience where Facebook is the
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   news feed.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:06.140]   And now for Google now, it's Google now, where all that data kind of feeds back and informs
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.820]   a core experience.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.140]   And more and more, it just feels like it's Google now for Google.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.740]   They have such a massive advantage.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.260]   Although I have to say, you know, I've been playing with Microsoft's new Windows Phone
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.260]   8.1.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.660]   You know, I don't somehow, you don't play with a Windows phone.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.660]   I don't think.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.660]   I do.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.940]   But I do play with it all the time.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:31.460]   So they've added Cortana, which is a dictation capability.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.180]   It's pretty.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.780]   But it's very Google now-ish too.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.860]   And I wonder if Microsoft's going to be able to do this.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.580]   So, you know, obviously they're playing catch up.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.540]   In fact, apparently it's not doing anything.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.540]   It's doing anything.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   Or a problem.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.980]   But what the...
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.620]   Maybe my network's down.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.620]   That could be.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.100]   No, seems like it's all right.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   But the idea of this is it will tell you things like, well, it just asked me this morning,
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.900]   "Hey, it looks like you live here.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   Is that right?"
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.300]   And I said, "Yes, it looks like you..."
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   Oh, here we go.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.700]   Looks like you work there.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.700]   Is that right?
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   Yes.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.260]   And then it says, "Good, we'll provide you with commute information from now on."
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.740]   So here's news updates based on, I've told her my interest.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   It knows where I am.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.740]   Here's the weather forecast.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.100]   But we'll also have commute times.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.420]   It can look at your calendar.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   So they're trying to do...
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.260]   I mean, this is very close to the idea of Google's future of...
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.140]   But it's going to butt its head up against privacy.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.300]   Yeah, well, Google has...
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.820]   And this is why you do what Facebook's done, did, and what Google has done, which is you
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.340]   have signals across a broad variety of things.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.300]   And Microsoft does provide mail, right?
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.980]   They have Bing Search.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:44.100]   They have a kind of similar layer to Google services.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.300]   But for you and I and Gina, we don't kick because we're in the Google world.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   Right.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.580]   I mean, I imagine if you use Outlook, if you use all of the docs and all that stuff in
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.780]   the Microsoft world, it makes sense.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.940]   And as I've often said on the show, it was the apps that drew me to the hardware.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.940]   Right.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.940]   It was the services.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.940]   I've heard no about the apps.
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.940]   It was the services.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.940]   The services.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.860]   I mean, if you use Office, they have Office on it.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.780]   I have, in fact, just the quick thumbnail on this is that they've...
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.580]   Windows Phone 8.1 is in many respects caught up if you're in the Microsoft ecosystem.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.020]   If you are, as I am in the Google system, Google has screwed you.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.740]   And that's not Microsoft, it's Google because there's no Google Plus on here.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   There's no Google Voice on here.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.740]   The Gmail support is weak.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.860]   I mean, it's there, but it's just not sorted very well.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   It's just everything.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   It's the all.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.740]   That's interesting, Leo, because that's why there really could never be a Facebook phone,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.980]   because you don't do all of these things on Facebook.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   Well, you...
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   Where do you go to the system or the other?
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   And it's Microsoft or Google, and those are the only two real competitors.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.540]   Apple has it, but Apple has so...
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.740]   Such strong privacy protections, they're never going to be willing to do what Google did,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.900]   which is say, "Oh, and by the way, we're aggregating everything from everything you use to, you know,
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.900]   together make that."
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.900]   Plus, you don't do all of these things.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.980]   Do you have a wrong here?
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.700]   You don't do as many things off.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.700]   Well, maybe you do.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.700]   You do.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   Apple.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   You do.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   You theoretically have a similar...
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.700]   You know, if you live in the...
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.420]   So I have to say, Windows Phone in that was everybody's good.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.880]   If you live in the Microsoft ecosystem, as Android is, if you live in the Google ecosystem,
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.460]   I just wish Google, in fact, if anybody's listening to Google, it'd be really nice if
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:24.740]   you provided your stuff here on Windows Phone, because then it would be a really solid choice
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.740]   for a lot of people.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.940]   What's the market share, Leo, and his...
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.940]   4%.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.940]   Wow.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   Wow.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   Wow.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   I mean...
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.940]   4%.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.340]   That's what the Mac was for years, right?
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.340]   Yes.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.500]   And we didn't, as Mac users, say, you know...
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.740]   Was it that low?
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.460]   Oh, it was 3.5% for almost...
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.700]   Almost until very recently.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.300]   It was very, very low.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.100]   Is that like Google's not developing for other...
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.180]   No, Google is into, I believe, because it's probably because of Scrugal, but for whatever
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.860]   reason, they say it's because it's too small a platform.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.100]   They are very much anti-Microsoft.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.100]   If they...
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   They made Microsoft pull down the YouTube app.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.100]   Remember...
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.100]   Oh, that's right.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   No, they don't want their apps on here.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.340]   And it's a little frustrating, to be honest.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.380]   The only app that's on here is Google Search.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.780]   I should try and see if it does now, Google Card, now.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.620]   I doubt it with us.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.780]   4%.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.740]   Hey, as a former 4%er.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.740]   That's the law.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   I went to the...
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.740]   No, just comment.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.340]   I went to the Acer event in New York.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   This was...
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.340]   I saw that.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.660]   And the reason I was there was I wanted to see 10 new Chromebooks and all they did was add
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.260]   a Intel Core into their Chromebook.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.260]   Right.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.260]   So it's a lot faster.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.460]   They'll do video better, they say, which is fine, but I'm greedy.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.460]   I want lots of stuff.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.180]   But it was really interesting.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:54.700]   It started off with Jason Chen, who started as CEO of Acer in January, and saying, "We've
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.540]   got to turn around Acer and we got to bring it back."
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.820]   And very candid, I thought.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:06.540]   And also charismatic, but just saying straight up, we know the PC industry is awful.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.540]   It's dying.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   It's not a good industry.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.180]   It's what we concentrated what we do.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:16.260]   And he emphasized Chromebooks as a growth area and tablets as a growth area and phones.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.380]   I think they're little late phones, but whatever.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.820]   So it's interesting to think that that fight over that market share for PCs then became
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.740]   rather boot.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.260]   So if you want Google to remember where you parked, you need Android for now.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.460]   Presumably, it will do that on iOS eventually or no.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.460]   No, maybe not.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.460]   I don't think you can, as an app, you have access to that stuff.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:42.980]   Yeah, the Android API actually can tell you if you're driving or biking or walking, and
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.260]   I'm not sure that iOS offers that.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.900]   So this may be Android only.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.700]   Well, how long?
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.940]   So what if you take one of those things that we have here on the East Coast called a bus?
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.700]   You never stop moving.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.300]   But you don't have to park your bus here.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.500]   Well, yeah, well, think that you parked your bus.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.580]   I got Google buses.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.380]   That's a really good question, actually.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.420]   I should take my phone on the bus and see how it goes.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.580]   You know, but that's where you go.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.220]   No, don't keep track of that anymore because I'm taking a bus.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   Right.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.220]   We don't know where your bus stop is.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220]   I mean, right.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.500]   Worst case scenario, it says, and everybody knows off there.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.220]   You got off there and it knows it's a bus stop.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   As soon as you stopped moving.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.820]   And the bus is a very particular kind of move.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.420]   If your mommy drives you to work, it's the same thing.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.780]   I mean, it only knows when you stop moving fast.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.340]   It doesn't know who drove you.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.260]   Mom dropped you off here.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.620]   Anyway, that's all I got.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.060]   That's the change.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:50.700]   Good Cortana running the board here today.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.700]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.460]   It had been so long, I thought we were done with it.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.460]   We were still changing.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   We were still changing.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.460]   We were like, oh, God.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.780]   For the longest time I mean, my Wi-Fi access point Cortana.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.740]   And of course, the password was, you know, 343 guilty spark.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.100]   And now like the Cortana is another thing.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.780]   I mean, I guess it's not another thing, but I don't know.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.700]   I love Cortana before she was a voice assistant.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   She was in Halo.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.100]   She was in Halo.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   The voice assistant says it always feels like they're women.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   They should be.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.420]   And in fact, in, I'm told, I was told in jet fighters, the heads up warning when you're
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.260]   stalling or you're, you know, pull up, pull up is a woman because fighter pilots listen
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.820]   to female voices.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.260]   Pull up, pull up.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   You're going to die, Jimmy.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.220]   I didn't mean to drop you off here.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.220]   Pull up.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.020]   There's a much like here I'm not using.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.100]   I think we have men listen to women's voices.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.620]   I mean, well, in Halo, I mean, Cortana's the brains and he's the brawn.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.620]   Right.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.620]   I mean, she's, you know, she's amazing.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.460]   She's the monitor of installation.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:54.180]   It's three, four, three guilty spark.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.740]   Are you a Halo fan?
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.740]   I am.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.540]   I know that about you.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.780]   I played the first one a lot.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   I was awesome.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.700]   It was pretty awesome.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   It's pretty violent.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.420]   It's the same part of my brain that watches UFC.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.460]   Um, this I do not know about you.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.460]   That is fascinating.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:19.420]   Speaking of fascinating, we're going to talk about Larry Page's incredible comeback.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.740]   I really got to know, Jeff, you've done the research.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.340]   You know if this Nicholas Carlson article is as full of it or accurate.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340]   So we'll find out.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.620]   Well, and also it also peeved greatly.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.940]   Our good friend, um, I'm having a senior moment.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.020]   Um, oh, this is so embarrassing.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   His name is Eric Schmit.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.820]   He writes for Wired.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.820]   Oh, Stephen Leopey.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.820]   Who wrote it?
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   Thank you.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   Stephen Leopey.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.820]   Inside the glass.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.860]   Stephen Leopey basically said most of that stuff is stuff that I reported in the video.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   Thank you Nicholas.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.980]   So you will get to that moment.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.500]   ZipRecruiter.com our sponsor for this segment of this week in Google.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.060]   Are you hiring?
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.420]   Do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.100]   Of course, there are many, many job boards, some better than others for what you're looking
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.100]   for.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.140]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could just press one button, put your job posting or you're
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.820]   listing on 50 job sites all at once plus LinkedIn plus Facebook, Twitter and Google
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.820]   Plus.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.100]   You can.

[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.140]   They'll even automatically highlight the best candidates.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.900]   You screen them, rate them and hire the right person fast.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.380]   We used ZipRecruiter and we're very happy with the results.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.780]   So we thought we'd try give you a chance to try it.

[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:12.380]   ziprecruiter.com/twig and we really thank ZipRecruiter for their support of this week
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.820]   in Google.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:21.060]   Larry Page, the untold story as seen and Stephen Levy's in the plex.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.940]   So I don't know how true that is.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.580]   I have no idea which one.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.380]   I take no statement here.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.460]   There's a couple of interesting things.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:35.140]   He starts with an anecdote about an early day anecdote for a couple of years of Google.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:41.220]   Larry decided to hire all fire rather, all the middle management.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.740]   This was, they had about 400 employees.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.380]   He said, "Why do we need people managing programmers?"
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.060]   So he just fired them all.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.340]   And apparently, characteristically, this was kind of interesting insight in public.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.900]   He had a staff meeting and said, "By the way, you're all fired."
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.700]   It was the project managers, right?
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.820]   He said he didn't think that engineers should have to report to someone who was not an engineer.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.900]   He felt that project managers were politicking and only pushing forward the projects that
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   they cared about.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.260]   He thought that it should just be a flat organization.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.780]   And engineers should just self-organize and build the things that they wanted to build.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:24.620]   It sounds a lot like GitHub, doesn't it?
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.460]   They talk about his flat robotic tone.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:36.660]   I guess Larry, like a lot of geeks, wasn't really comfortable with people.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.780]   As Paige talked, Carlson wrote, although who knows, maybe Stephen wrote this.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:47.100]   He kept his gaze averted resisting direct eye contact, though he was in a...
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.540]   He's a cake.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.420]   I don't even look you in the eyes.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.360]   Though he was an appealing presence with above average height in nearly black hair.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.540]   That's appealing.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.060]   He was socially awkward.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.420]   So apparently, that was a mistake because they ended up hiring all the project managers
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.900]   back later.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.380]   This is an interesting one.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:18.220]   The investors said, "You and Sergey are not qualified to run this company.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.580]   You're under 30.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.460]   You need to bring in adult supervision."
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.620]   That's always what Larry and Sergey called Eric Schmidt.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:33.420]   Apparently, there was a lot of resistance to it from everybody.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.380]   But those investors won.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.140]   Schmidt was brought in.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:46.060]   Oh, here's another one.
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.540]   Everywhere you look, there were no-it-alls ready to gleefully tear into you.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.140]   That was...
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   For Paige's employees, working at Google felt more like a never-ending thesis defense.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.260]   Paige had originally bonded with Brin over a day of fierce argument.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.180]   That's how their relationship grew.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.780]   Their debates were not shouting matches.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.740]   There were a series of blunt points made by one side.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.420]   Then the other, with a little name calling thrown in, Paige would call one of Brin's
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.420]   ideas.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.500]   Stupid Brin would say Paige's idea was naive, then they both call each other bastards.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.700]   Once again, geeks.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.860]   Except for every geek except Gina, who was too nice to do that.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.340]   Well, male geeks.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.140]   Yes, male geeks, exactly.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.860]   This is a very masculine way.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   The whole game of one upmanship is a very...
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.060]   Not trying to be sexist, but it's kind of a masculine style of communication.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.340]   One that certainly women can engage in and men cannot engage in.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.140]   I'm just generally speaking.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   But yeah, this kind of thing drives me crazy about our community.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   I'll be honest.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.820]   It's like the who's smarter, the well actually...
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.820]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.820]   Well, actually.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.820]   Well, actually.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.060]   If you knew anything.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:02.340]   You know, this actually sidebar here, but I saved this out to a pocket.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.340]   It was an interesting article.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.340]   I wonder if you read it.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:12.980]   Let me see if I can log into my pocket and show you.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.740]   About programmers and why being a programmer is such a bitch.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.780]   That was a sexy thing.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.780]   It's in there.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:20.780]   It's called programming sucks.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   It's in the doc.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:31.780]   Basically, the premise is all programs are written by a bunch of dicks.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   It's from stilldrinking.org.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:42.660]   And basically, it's like building a bridge that he says building a bridge by a bunch
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660]   of...
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   Imagine joining an engineering team.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   You're excited.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.660]   You're full of ideas.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.660]   Probably just out of school.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.180]   And the world of clean, beautiful designs awe inspiring.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   And their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy and strength.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.300]   You start by meeting Mary, who introduces you to Fred.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:03.620]   You're going to be working on a bridge.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:08.660]   After you get through 15 security checks installed by Dave, because Dave had his sweater stolen
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.620]   off his desk once and never again.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.380]   Fred only works with wood.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.100]   So you ask why he's involved because this bridge is going to be out of steel.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.300]   He says, Mary says, "Don't worry, Fred's going to handle the walkways."
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.300]   What walkways?
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.300]   Well, Fred made a good case for walkways.
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.860]   They're going to add to it the bridge's appeal.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.460]   But we're going to have to build it without railings because there's a strict no railings
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.740]   rule enforced by Phil, who's not an engineer.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.020]   Nobody's really sure what Phil does, but it's definitely full of synergy and has to do
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.460]   with upper management.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.700]   And none of the engineers want to deal with that.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.220]   So they just let Phil do with what they want.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.300]   This is awesome.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.820]   It sounds so real.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:53.540]   Sarah, meanwhile, has found several hemorrhaging edge paving techniques and worked them into
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.340]   all the bridge designs.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:00.100]   So you'll have to build around each one as the bridge progresses since each one means
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.820]   different underlying support and safety concerns.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:07.380]   Tom and Harry have been working together for years, but they have an ongoing feud over
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.620]   whether to use metric or imperial measurements.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:14.420]   And it's become a case of whoever got to that part of the design first.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.460]   This has become such a headache for the people actually screwing things together.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.820]   They've just given up and forced hammered or welded their way through the day with whatever
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.940]   parts were handy.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.900]   Now the bridge was designed as a suspension bridge, but since nobody knew actually how
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.780]   to build a suspension bridge, they got halfway through it, then just added extra support columns
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.260]   to keep the thing standing.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.140]   But they left the suspension cables because, well, there's still sort of holding up parts
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.740]   of the bridge and nobody knows which parts, but everybody's pretty sure they're important
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.540]   parts.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.140]   After the introductions are made, you're invited to come up with some new ideas, but you don't
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:49.220]   have any because you're a propulsion engineer and don't know anything about bridges.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.380]   He then says, would you drive across this bridge?
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.380]   No.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:59.820]   Every single program you've ever used has some version of this dynamic, including one part,
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.380]   one part, one part.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.940]   When the lead developer goes and you hire a new one, they throw out absolutely everything
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.300]   that was ever done before.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.660]   That's probably the best thing they could do.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.660]   Start over.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:16.100]   But you know what we forget, we think of software as written, you know, kind of somewhat perfectly
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.860]   with an attention to detail and so forth.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.740]   We forget it's written by humans, many of whom are dicks.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.500]   Most of them can't look each other in the eye.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   Oh my God.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.540]   No, I just kind of want to quit.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.740]   Now, but you're mostly working on your own on ThinkUp, right?
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.380]   I mean, this is your, that's the way to do it, right?
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:44.180]   He says, every engineer has in, you know, in a drawer somewhere in his desk when he gets
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.820]   home and turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.340]   and opens up a file on their computer.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.220]   It's something they wrote or they found and they knew they had to save it and they read
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.540]   over the lines and weep at their beauty.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:04.620]   Then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.420]   of all that is good and true in the world.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.060]   The file is good code.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.580]   It has sensible consistent names for functions and variables.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   It's concise.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.260]   It doesn't do anything obviously stupid.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.340]   It has never had to live in the wild or answer to a sales team.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.220]   It does exactly one mundane specific thing and it does it well.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.020]   It was written by a single person and never touched by another.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.340]   It reads like poetry written by someone over 30.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.980]   I love this is the best piece ever.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.900]   You know, I work with a lot of great engineers, some of whom with my company, some of whom
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.660]   who are just community contributors and, you know, certainly we've run into these issues
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.700]   but I have a very kind of strict like not in our community, like not in our community.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.700]   We don't mansplain.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.060]   We don't do this one option.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.620]   We don't refactor because it just makes it prettier for the programmers.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.940]   We build things in service to the user but these are all things you have to continue to
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   reinforce.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.940]   It's entropy.
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.940]   It is.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:02.660]   I was saying to Jeff in the pre-show that as a perfectionist and a completionist, it hurts
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.780]   me to push code that isn't, you know, like Steve Jobs, the story about, you know, the
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.940]   painting the back of the fence that no one sees.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.700]   Like, it hurts me when the back of the fence isn't painted, right?
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   But like I push code like that all the time because code needs to get used or else it
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   doesn't matter, right?
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.580]   Like, if no one uses it and it doesn't matter, if it's not working, it doesn't matter and
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.620]   there's a big scale of functioning but I could go on about this forever.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:30.980]   But yes, part of the way that I got around this is by leading my own projects and trying
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.900]   to set the tone for this stuff doesn't, you know, go on here.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.300]   But that's not always possible, you know, particularly if you're in a big company on
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.260]   a software team that you get assigned to.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.140]   But it's funny because it's all true.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.940]   This stuff all happens.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.940]   This is why you want to work for Gina.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   This is why you want to start your own company you think.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.940]   I don't want to deal with this.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:53:01.880]   Isn't there I can't say the name of this programming language, but there's a programming language
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:08.500]   called brain F star star star that is intentionally horrible.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.740]   This is this is in that language.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.300]   Little code snippet on the screen here.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:19.220]   This is how you do hello world in that language plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:26.260]   bracket angle.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.100]   That is brain F.
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.900]   Have people write code in it just to be ornery?
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:36.740]   One of the ways that I also avoid the hemorrhaging edge stuff is that I use a very old programming
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.740]   language.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.140]   It's just that people hate I use PHP in my sequel.
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.140]   It's old.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.740]   No one cares about anymore.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.420]   But what's nice is that it works and it is years of testing behind it and it doesn't
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.460]   really track programmers who are like well actually you should be writing this and go
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.580]   and not Ruby get my J.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   I know.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   So that's a good advantage.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.580]   It's all.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.220]   I roll over that.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:05.140]   That's like a German doing an invitation of an American accent that was Gina doing
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.140]   doing programmer.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.140]   I like that.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.140]   You really replace your temporary language.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   I love your visualization.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.140]   I love your background.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.140]   Oh, your neck beard you.
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:18.140]   You see, I didn't see this.
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:25.020]   There's a programming language called law code that is written in law cat.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.020]   Hi.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.380]   Ken has STD IO visible.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.380]   Hi world.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.380]   Okay.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   Thanks.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380]   Bye.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   Sorry.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.700]   Programmer joke.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.700]   Let's move on.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.580]   Sure.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.900]   We have other things to talk about.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:44.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   The end of Google plus.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:46.900]   What do you think?
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.380]   Vic on Dr.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.060]   Gone in a flash.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:55.900]   Very quickly fired.
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.460]   I don't think so.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.460]   I think maybe frustrated, but he's too respected.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.460]   He's too.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.380]   He's very respected in that world.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.420]   Friends of friends told me that he was a real pain to work for.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:11.660]   And I didn't make anything of it because I think a lot of good managers are really a
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.660]   pain to work for.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.060]   You know, look, I don't know.
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.220]   I don't know.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.020]   We all like Vic, but we don't see the management side.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.620]   We all like we don't work for him.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   Right.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.900]   Well, I mean, my last being with him and Bradley and a few weeks ago when I was there
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:34.740]   last time, yeah, Vic is Vic like a Google or holds tight to the chest and he's demanding
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:39.700]   and, you know, can be dismissive, but he's very smart.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.620]   And, you know, I respect the hell out of him.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.380]   I think he's done something amazing.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.100]   You know, we're getting his death.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.100]   No things.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.500]   Anthony DeRosa, who's now at circa, just tweeted a wonderful thing.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.580]   He said, Twitter on the web are dead.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.940]   Long live back web and point cast.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:59.660]   Everybody is writing the like, X, X, X is dead.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   I mean, Facebook is dead.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.660]   Yeah, it's such a bad.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:02.660]   Who causes dead?
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   Everything's dead.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.660]   It's a dumb trope.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   Everything's dead.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.660]   Walking dead.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   Zombie dead.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:12.140]   I asked my, I was talking to my daughter, Abby is very smart for 22.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.740]   And we were talking about sick joke cycles.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.420]   There's a guy, a professor at Berkeley called Alan Dundee named Alan Dundee who writes,
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.580]   done that, I guess, writes, he's a sociologist.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:26.420]   And he says sick joke cycles always have to do with morbid fears that are suppressed
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.260]   in a society, but come out as jokes.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:33.940]   The dead baby joke cycle was right when Roe v. Wade happened and the bait was very intense
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.140]   over abortion.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.740]   Segregation led to the elephant jokes.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.580]   You figure out why.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.020]   So I said, what do you think zombies?
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.620]   Why do you think we're so into zombies?
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.860]   And Abby said, well, I think it has to do with the fear of ecological disaster, the
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.300]   end of the world as we know it.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:57:01.540]   And an overall kind of underlying fear that this will not stand that we are, we are in
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:06.540]   fact decaying before I very often that everything is dying.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:12.500]   But why else would we all in zombies?
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.820]   I'm an optimist.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.540]   I'm into fairies.
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.100]   A late optimist to put an optimist.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.780]   I come and go, you know.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.460]   So I don't think Google plus is gone by any means.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:28.500]   But I think that it seems to be the case, CNET reported that many of its employees have
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.140]   been transferred to the Android group, right?
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.340]   So let's talk about what we mean by Google plus.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.260]   Do you mean Google plus the social network?
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.060]   You think the social network is going to stick around?
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.180]   Because I think that there's actually a possibility that we'll go through.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180]   That might be gone.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.180]   But hangouts and photos.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.020]   Hangouts got moved to Android.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.660]   Photos got moved to Android.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.500]   They're both standalone apps.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.220]   Those are the things that I use the most to Google plus that are specifically Google
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:56.780]   plus, you know, of course, not counting my Google plus login to everything, you know,
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.100]   YouTube and Gmail and everything else.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.420]   And photos and hangouts are the way that I use Google plus.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:05.780]   I just haven't gotten into the social network.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.300]   And I wonder, you know, I wonder if the social network part of Google plus, you know, won't
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.300]   make it.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.060]   And if it doesn't, that doesn't mean that Google plus was a failure.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:18.180]   It's a huge, I'll tell you this though.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:22.060]   It would be devastating to confidence in Google.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.060]   Yes.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:31.020]   Every time they kill a widely used thing.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.700]   And I mean, Gina is already over this because they killed wave after she wrote a book about
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.700]   it.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.700]   And their reader, people were in the middle of the picture.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.100]   And buzz.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.740]   And you can go on and on and we're watching the knife hanging over Google voice.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   If they kill.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.740]   I don't say that.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   Don't say it.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.740]   Well, exactly.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:47.740]   At what point do people go, well, that's screw that.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.020]   I'm never trusting Google again.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.180]   This is what Zuckerberg said today is you can trust us.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.180]   Right.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.180]   Will be here for you.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:00.220]   There is a detriment to keeping even if this is not a hugely successful thing.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:08.380]   But, you see, I'm still going to argue with that because yes, the numbers are kind of
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.100]   trumped with sign ins and all that.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.100]   The numbers are ridiculous.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.340]   And I don't really have three million followers and so on and so forth.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.380]   But I do find conversations there.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.940]   I do find people there.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.020]   The growth rate was considerable.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   It's sizable.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.820]   It's bigger than Twitter, which is also being declared dead today, which is just as ridiculous.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.700]   I don't think that Google plus is a failure.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.300]   I think it's part of a larger strategy.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.260]   Now, the bigger question then is, what's that larger strategy now?
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.180]   Will Google does Google need these signals?
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.020]   Are they willing to just kill this because they don't know?
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.860]   It's not going to be expected.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.700]   And then risk that trust.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.700]   I think there's a lot of confusion.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:47.940]   By the way, just so you know, the breaking story, not seeing that it was tech crunch
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.220]   and Alexia Totsus article said Google plus is walking dead.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.220]   So walking is zombie.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.060]   The rest of my case.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.660]   Well, okay, here's one thing.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.220]   Google plus might have been something that Facebook tricked Google into launching because
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:09.820]   it seemed to be and Facebook certainly was a strong proponent of this, that social search
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.380]   was the more important search.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:17.420]   But I got to say that may not have been what happened that the Facebook's own social search
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.220]   has been a flop.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.420]   There's no evidence that being benefits from social integration.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.300]   Google might have realized, you know what, that was a mistake.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.980]   These signals we're getting from Google plus do not help us in search.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.580]   But it's not just search Leo.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.940]   It's also advertising.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.740]   And is there any advertising in Google plus?
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.900]   No, it's not the point.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.620]   Go back to what you said before.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.340]   Google is a bunch of disparate applications.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.140]   What ties it together is a relationship with the user and the knowledge that comes from
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.140]   that.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.540]   You don't have to put advertising in every app to get the advertising benefit.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.940]   If you get the question that I would say is, I don't think Google plus alone gives you
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:03.780]   terribly valuable signals for that monetization and that relevance, that serving of relevance.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.260]   Maps gives you really valuable signals.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.500]   Search gives you really valuable signals.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   Plus, not so much.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.260]   And it's a signals business.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.900]   Google plus is the technical implementation of the unified privacy policy.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.700]   Google plus is Google saying, we know who you are across all of your apps because you're
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.900]   using this single sign in.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]   It's a platform.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:31.220]   And to me, I look at the social network Google plus as one app, whereas Hangouts is another.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220]   Photos is another.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.980]   And then YouTube, which all got retrofitted back in, YouTube, Gmail, etc.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.820]   is another.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:43.740]   So and Google now is only possible because of Google sign in.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.660]   If you think Google plus is just Google sign in as I'm the same person across all these
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.540]   things, that's a huge success.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.180]   I think this is why when people talk about Google plus, I think that they're referring
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.260]   to the social network.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.260]   And you're right, Jeff.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.260]   There's not a lot of signals there.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.980]   I mean, I guess there's plus ones and reshares and things.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.220]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.220]   Have they?
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.220]   Have they?
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220]   Really?
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.740]   I mean, is this part of what Facebook was talking about, the death of the page and the
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.340]   rise of the apps?
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340]   I want to see.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.420]   And by the way, let's separate the notion.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.220]   I love Google plus.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.660]   And a lot of people love Google plus.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.780]   I loved buzz and a lot of people love buzz.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.220]   That's irrelevant.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.780]   We can acknowledge that how much love you feel for it is not a determinant.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.660]   Even how many people use it may not be determinant.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.780]   I just think it would be a state of kill another service at this point.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.300]   That's just to trust point it does.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   I think it would be I think it would be a big thing.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.300]   It would be one of a.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.100]   You can't stop it from a PR perspective.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.100]   Yes.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.220]   And a morale perspective, I think is inside.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.820]   They were all told plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:46.820]   Never mind would not.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.380]   Well, that's what happened right last year.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.300]   Your bonus was dependent on social.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.220]   It would be one hell of a platter of crow.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.220]   Mm hmm.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:02.140]   Uh, I don't, and I don't see it, but I don't think they've handled the PR here well, because
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.060]   they should have predicted this was going to be the case and, and should have been out.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.100]   So, so statement of denials, they should do some tangible things to bolster plus.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.100]   Had a, at a feature now.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.100]   That's that.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.340]   Um, uh, so do you think Vic left?
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.340]   Cause he was, he saw the writing on the wall and said he's disappointed.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:27.020]   They took a bunch of people away from me, moved it over to, uh, to Android and Sundar.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020]   Did Vic leave?
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020]   What happened?
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   He's not there anymore.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.020]   Like with,
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.020]   I don't know.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.020]   Tells us this was a reorg and him and him, his departure was part of that reorg.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020]   I don't know.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020]   I don't know.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020]   Is it like in Silicon Valley?
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.220]   Is he up on the roof of the rest of the guys who don't have a job?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   He's having a barbecue.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.220]   He's on a sign.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.740]   Do you want to, you want to walk to Arby's for lunch?
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740]   Is that what he's doing?
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.740]   Is that?
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.580]   Vic wouldn't have that.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.820]   And I'm sure that he's vested.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.780]   Uh, I'm sure that he can leave and do very well.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.700]   Uh, he, he drives a Tesla.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.860]   He's doing fun.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.860]   I'm sure he's doing fine.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.300]   But the other one should think was.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.300]   Arby's.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.300]   They'll take him.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.540]   Okay, I'll stop making Silicon Valley.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.540]   Sorry.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.540]   I love that show.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.540]   Okay.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.540]   Sorry.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.340]   He's replaced by someone who's keeping his day job, important job as an engineer.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.340]   Dave Brisson.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.180]   And that person is also not promoted to senior VP.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.340]   So now Google plus is reports to something down a rank.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.420]   Dave Bespers seems almost like a placeholder.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.820]   Like okay, you're already, you know, director of engineering.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.820]   Here's another thing.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.260]   He's all respected, but he's still a director of engineering.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.060]   And what about Bradley Horowitz who must feel like crap right about now?
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.060]   I think so.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.780]   But one, one story that I read about, about Bespers, right?
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.780]   Is that his name?
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.780]   I guess B-E-S-B-R-I-S could be big.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.140]   Uh, was that he just wasn't as visible that he really was Vic's right hand.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140]   Okay.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.260]   And Bradley's who I saw because Bradley's product guy.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.260]   Right.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.980]   But who is, you know, it's like working in a publishing house.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.540]   The only way to rise is because if you sell ads, Google the only way to rise if you're
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.140]   an engineer.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   I like Bradley.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.140]   Bradley, we love you, man.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.140]   Don't ever change.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.140]   Bradley's fresh.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.140]   We love Bradley.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.780]   He was the product manager and outside, I guess widely considered to be the logical replacement
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   for Vic.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.780]   But maybe, but as you say, maybe not, maybe Dave is always there.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.220]   Just we didn't know about it.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.140]   Larry Page said nice things about Vic, of course.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:35.100]   But when somebody leaves and leaves right away, like leaves like I'm gone now, my office,
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]   you can have my office.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:42.380]   Well, usually I'm transitioning out in my last days and four weeks and I'll be, you know,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.940]   I mean, normally, right when these kinds of things are planned, it's a little bit more.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.380]   So that means competitor.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.620]   Well like, what's his name who left to go to China?
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:59.940]   Hugo Hugo, who go, you go, you go, you go, you go, you go, you just like he said, like
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.380]   I'm going to show me.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.380]   This wasn't that.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.380]   I mean, Vic's vested, right?
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.820]   Maybe he wants to rest.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   But it's like that memo.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:14.420]   He wants to spend more time with his family memo, which is always like the smoking gun.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.300]   If you ever get a memo that Leo wants to spend more time with his family, you know, I was
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   fired.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   Okay.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300]   I don't know what that does about your family.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.980]   That's the last thing I don't want to do.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   What?
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.980]   Spend time with you?
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.140]   Spend time with my family.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.420]   No, no, no choice.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   We are your family.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.740]   You are my children.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.740]   You're my, you're my people.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.740]   I don't know.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740]   I will miss Vic.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:45.180]   I don't, yeah, apparently he had a pugnacious approach according to recode with Google Plus
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.180]   and maybe his employees.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:56.940]   Well, if Google listens to us, not that it matters, don't kill Plus.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.940]   It's nice of place.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.420]   I don't, I really would prefer that nobody used it.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.820]   Just the few of us in the know and just let's keep it for that.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.660]   In fact, it's got a little bit too like real world for me.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.900]   Let's keep it out of Google.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.060]   Get the norms out of Google Plus.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.500]   Well, but they, they know more normies in Google Plus.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.380]   I don't have too many of those.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.300]   Let me go back to the question I asked earlier.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.820]   Rewrite API.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.460]   That's a great question.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:31.620]   If you say the Google Plus is more abundant, maybe not dead, but walking dead, would a right
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.860]   API have helped?
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.100]   So if you build a like a blooper, if people haven't been following this, you have a read
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.780]   API so, so apps can read it, but they can't post to it.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.700]   So for instance, there's no Google Plus app on Windows Phone, but there is an app that
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.100]   lets me read my Google Plus.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.740]   I just can't post to it because it uses the API.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.140]   Would it be better if they had allowed third party apps?
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   I don't think so.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.020]   Well, a lot more people would have piped their content from Twitter or Facebook.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.020]   You would have made it like buzz.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   That's what killed buzz.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:05.460]   Automatically into right into Google Plus, which would have meant that they could probably
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:10.020]   claim a lot more active users who are not really active, right?
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:14.300]   I mean, I don't, they, Google was pretty staunch that for the beginning, that's not what they
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   wanted.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   They didn't want that.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   I think there was the right thing.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.300]   I was angry, but I have come around.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.260]   By the way, there are normies and I can't avoid the normies because this was a mistake.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.140]   They started putting the hot stuff in my stream.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.180]   It's always like some crap.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.540]   It's always with like a inspirational quote or something.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.300]   Yeah, it's Facebook crap.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.380]   It's those posters you buy in malls, right?
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:48.660]   The sunsets, which also says a very bad thing, well, in my view, I'm going to stop here,
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.620]   but we all are right now.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.100]   He doesn't send a great branding message about what Google Plus and people really are.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.020]   And why do I want to get mass crap there?
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.460]   I had enough of that in media.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.460]   Right.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460]   It's why I'm on Google Plus.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.460]   It's hot.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.500]   It's just not very smart and it's not tailored to me.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:12.940]   Yeah, I've always found that irritating and I constantly kill it and get angry at it.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.180]   But then it goes away for a while.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.140]   Like I haven't seen it in a week or two.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.140]   Maybe they fixed it.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.140]   Well, they do things.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.140]   And say, think about Google Plus.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   There were things that I complained about day one, we all complained that day one and
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.940]   quietly, slowly, they get through the list and they fix things.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:30.540]   And the first thing, of course, was the scobo problem.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.540]   He's still on there though.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.180]   Well, it has to be declared that dead.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.180]   Like everything that he declared.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.180]   Everything's dead.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.620]   He doesn't like glass anymore.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.620]   You know what?
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.620]   I don't see the WhatsApp.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.700]   Maybe they did start taking that out.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:49.060]   Maybe maybe that's what Vic liked and they get rid of it.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.380]   And I said, no one's hot.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380]   I'm out of here.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.380]   Right.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.380]   I want those posters.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.180]   He stormed out.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.180]   Starmed out.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.820]   Well, Vic, we also like you.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.060]   I think Vic's a very smart guy.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.780]   And when he gets bored of being home in two weeks, I'll be eager to see what he does
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780]   next.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:09.500]   Vic, there's always a show waiting here at the Twit Network for you.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   It's time for the Vic Kondo Truscho.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.580]   I think I like it.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.020]   And don't kill Google Plus.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   That would be a mistake.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.020]   I wouldn't have anywhere to go online.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.820]   I'd have to find something else.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.860]   And notice there's not a lot of Twitter clones popping up anymore.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.780]   This might be an out of this might be an old and in the way idea, this idea of sharing
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.780]   on a network.
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:38.620]   I mean, do people create new stuff like this anymore?
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.180]   It's a photo page there.
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.020]   It's a whole different social networks.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.380]   No, they create apps, right?
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.380]   Right.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.380]   They make, right.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   There's lots of those.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.380]   Mm hmm.
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.620]   It's interesting.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.100]   Maybe this is an old fashioned idea.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   It's like the portal.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:05.540]   We had a long conversation on the Twit show on Sunday about the FCC proposed FCC rules,
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:11.420]   the lying sack of filth that is the chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, Cable.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.380]   Who, by the way, finally talks about it.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.620]   Public guess where he does that?
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620]   The cable show.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620]   Cable show.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.500]   He's the one who said, Oh, we didn't pay no attention.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   I love Alexis.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.020]   So Haney and he, we're going to try to get him.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.660]   We're going to have any succeeding respond to my request to get him onto it.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660]   Is he going to be on?
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.660]   His people got in contact.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:32.660]   I had no idea that was happening.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.860]   So I was very confused.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.860]   Good.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.340]   We'd love to get the Reddit co-founder Alexis Haney and on.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:41.380]   He's the guy who did the soap of Pippa protest that was so successful in killing soap and
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.540]   did mark my words will be president one day.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.180]   I love Alexis.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.260]   I love him.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:54.060]   So now his latest plan is he wants to buy a billboard outside the FCC saying save our
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.060]   net.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.940]   Now he hasn't determined what it's going to be called yet, but he's got a crowd.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.140]   Crowd till this one of his startups.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.660]   He's got a crowd till campaign to raise money for the billboard.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.660]   They're up to $10,000.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.420]   They've got 15 days left to raise the next 10,000.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.140]   I put a thousand in because I think this is a good idea.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.140]   Good.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.140]   Wow.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.140]   Wow.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   Wow.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.140]   That's good for you.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.540]   Hey, this to me, this is a hot button topic because and I'm very upset.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.060]   There isn't a lot more heat in the discussion about it.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.700]   It's hard to understand and I knew that and I've talked about it on the radio.
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.940]   I've talked about it as many places I can.
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:34.180]   Alexis does a very good job of explaining it so real people can understand it.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.020]   But it's hard.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.580]   It's really hard to get people to care about it.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.820]   And the sad thing is they won't care until it's way too late.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:48.260]   So the FCC is by the way, no one sees these proposed rules yet.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.340]   But they said, Wall Street Journal on Wednesday last said that the FCC would circulate them
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.460]   on Thursday, still waiting to see them.
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.540]   What do you pray it up, Wheeler?
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.020]   Then what about this stuff, Leo, that I mean, the argument made in some quarters is he has
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.260]   no choice because the way the legislation is written on section 720 or whatever.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.260]   706.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.580]   I could tell I could tell you the whole the whole pracy right in a couple of choices.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.060]   They can instead just declare a utility and be done with it.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:20.020]   You remember Verizon sued the FCC over their open internet rules, their proposed rules
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.020]   and lost in court.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.020]   And the court was very clear.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:28.500]   They said under the Telecommunications Act, specifically 706, section 706, you cannot do
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500]   this.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.340]   You don't have the right to do it unless you say broadband providers are common carriers.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.340]   They are utilities.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.820]   Then you do have the right.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.820]   The court was very clear.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.180]   They even the court even said the opinion of the court said, we understand you got to
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.180]   protect the open internet.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:48.780]   This is an important thing, but you can't do it the way that the Congress has set up
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.780]   the FCC.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:55.900]   You can't do it unless you declare these broadband providers common carriers.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:00.420]   Now I'm not and we talked at length about this with Denise Howell, who is an attorney.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.220]   She's talked about it on this week in law.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.260]   I'm not sure why the FCC would be reluctant to do that.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.180]   Maybe there are unintended consequences.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:11.580]   But it is a simple clear path to preserving an open internet.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.340]   Well, I'll tell you the unintended consequences.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.180]   It's a reduction in campaign contributions.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.180]   Crazy.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.780]   How's Tom Wheeler going to get a job with the cable industry after his chairmanship's over?
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:27.120]   Just like Powell, old prior chair, Michael Powell now runs the NCTA, the National Cable
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.560]   Television Association.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.740]   That by the way is Tom Wheeler's old job.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.980]   Tom Wheeler is in the door is hitting us in the ass people.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.540]   Tom Wheeler is beside being the chairman of the FCC.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:42.660]   He's also in the cable hall of fame and the wireless hall of fame for service to the cable
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:45.220]   and wireless industries.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.180]   So I mean, it's so corrupt.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.780]   It's so obviously corrupt.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.180]   Obama, how dare you?
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.820]   I'm really disappointed.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.980]   I really feel like he has let us down in a great many ways.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.980]   This is one of the worst.
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.140]   For our tribe, this is the worst part.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:05.140]   For my businesses, this is the worst because I have a very big dog in this hunt.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:11.540]   A twit wouldn't exist if I had to pay extra to get to you at a reasonable speed.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.180]   There will be no streaming video from us.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:23.360]   As so many have said, and by the way, and I retweeted her, in fact, I think Elizabeth
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:29.380]   Warren is running for president, but she had some really good, both two of my favorite
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:33.820]   people, members of Congress have excoriated Wheeler over this.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.100]   One is Al Franken, Senator for Minnesota.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:38.540]   The other is Elizabeth Warren from New Jersey.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.980]   She said, we don't know from Massachusetts.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:41.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:45.100]   We don't know who's going to have the next big idea in this country, but we're pretty
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.020]   sure they're going to need to get online to do it.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.020]   Enough said.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.020]   Isn't that great?
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.140]   Yeah, that's that nails it.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.700]   Enough said.
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.780]   So here's a question, Liam.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:04.660]   My fear is that, and there's a story in the Wall Street Journal just about an hour ago
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:10.380]   that says that Google and Netflix and Yahoo are considering a campaign, a public campaign
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.740]   against Wheeler on this.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.980]   My fear though is that if they wanted to be evil, they'd say, well, you know what?
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.380]   We have the money to pay.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.940]   We're now the big old guys.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.300]   Let's pull the ladder up behind us.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.220]   We don't want any of these up starts killing us.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.740]   They totally could.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.500]   They could really do that.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:35.740]   I think there's a real moment of a moral test here for them that if Netflix and Google
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:40.980]   and company do come out against Wheeler on this, yeah, they're not crazy about paying
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:48.220]   and they're not crazy about the telcos, but they are the ones in the position to pay.
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:51.420]   They're going to be teetering right now.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.620]   Some lawyer is always a lawyer in these companies.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:57.220]   We say, well, you know, it's not a bad idea.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:01.980]   Pull up that ladder.
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.460]   But they're the ones who could fight on behalf of the net and need to.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:09.380]   And it's the soap of people fight all over again.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:14.980]   But with the last time it was, hey, they're going to stop you from watching movies.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.540]   Savetheinternet.com.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.540]   What can I do?
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.460]   Just go to savetheinternet.com and lots of information there.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:26.740]   I don't think you need to give money to Alexis O'Haney and to build a billboard, but certainly
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.020]   call the FCC, call Congress.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.700]   There will be a day of action May 15th.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.900]   I'm not sure what our participation will be in that.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.380]   Last time on SOPA Pippa Day, we went black and white, which I thought was a really perfect
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:46.620]   way to both raise interest, but also to continue our mission, which is to inform people about
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.180]   this stuff.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.900]   Contact your Congress, Critter.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.940]   Unfortunately, the only people who really understand this are geeks and geeks are notoriously inactive
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.260]   in politics.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.060]   Yes.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:04.900]   Because on the bridge, they just go ahead and connect the wood to the metal and not wait
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.900]   on it.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:06.900]   Exactly.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.900]   Exactly.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.900]   It's a bridge.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.380]   You do have to say, where are Google?
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.380]   Where is Netflix and all of this?
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.740]   I mean, why aren't they yelling bloody murder?
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.740]   Because they're already, they got the money.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.740]   They'll build a book.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.620]   But that's where the Wall Street Journal just said that Google Yahoo and Netflix are
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.620]   considering a campaign.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.420]   Considering is not campaigning.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.100]   Well, well, exactly.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:31.140]   That's why we've got to keep the pressure on them.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   Let's see.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.540]   I want to get through this pretty quick here.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540]   What's new with glass?
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.540]   Explore nearby?
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:43.180]   Field trip, you mentioned that.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.180]   One plus one.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:47.500]   You guys talked about that extensively last night on all about Android.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.500]   We did.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.500]   We did.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.500]   And we talked about the Android Silver program as well.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500]   Silver.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   So let's do one plus one first.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500]   So these are former Oppo guys.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.420]   Oppo makes a phone that's pretty nice, pretty sweet, although nobody I know has it.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.420]   Android phone.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:08.220]   And now they've gone off to form a company, O P O one plus one, one plus P.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.580]   And they're associated with Oppo.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.820]   They're bankrolled by Oppo, which people were upset about for stupid reasons, which
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   I don't guess.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.260]   And they want to make the ultimate phone with signage and mod running on it.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.260]   Yep.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.900]   They're saying in June, but we have we seen it.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.300]   Some people have one, right?
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:29.980]   Well, they did this crazy marketing thing where you had to enter a lottery and agree
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   to smash your phone.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:35.900]   If you were picked to begin the lottery, you had to destroy your current smartphone to
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:42.380]   get a one plus one for a dollar, which we agreed on.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:45.340]   All that Android was just dumb.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:49.260]   But otherwise the phone itself.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.340]   It looks pretty cool.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.220]   I mean, it's a nice, it's a really nice handset.
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   And cheap, 299.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.600]   It'll be like a nexus.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   Except ranked sandwich and mod.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.600]   Think about that.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.100]   No, well, Gina, as I recall, you said last week, doesn't it run either San, San engine
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:12.220]   mod or the current Google Android official or is it just sandwich and mod?
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.580]   I thought it was just, but I could be wrong.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:15.580]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.940]   I thought you saw maybe that could be my mistake from hearing you wrong last week.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:24.380]   Anyway, June availability doesn't, I mean, that rendering looks beautiful.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:29.660]   But it is in fact just an artist rendering.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.700]   I wouldn't rush.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.860]   There's a lot of slip, took the tongue and the lip.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.980]   I would wait and see.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.780]   I've been burnt so many times with phones that looked great on paper.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.740]   There's a few people who have them in the wild.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.420]   There's like review units out there.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.420]   Right.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.780]   I mean, who has one that we, MKBHD has one.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.860]   Of course, Marcus has one.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.860]   Marcus Brownlee.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.820]   Getting through it.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.820]   30 second ahead.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:01.820]   Oh man.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:06.780]   But Marcus is raking it in.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.700]   I would never allow a 30 second pre-roll.
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:09.700]   I really wouldn't.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.940]   I just, you have to, there's no skip.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:13.940]   Nope.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:19.420]   This has been an option for some content creators that they can have a full 30 second pre-roll
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   ad.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.420]   Ironically, from Microsoft.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.420]   Right.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.420]   All right.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.860]   Let's see it.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:26.860]   He's got it.
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:27.860]   Where is it?
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.860]   There it is.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.860]   It's fun.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:30.860]   So the hands-on footage is from him.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:31.860]   I'll link that right below the like button.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:32.860]   No, apparently.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860]   Oh, he doesn't have it.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.860]   I thought he had one plus one.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.860]   What?
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.500]   I was teased a lot by this Chinese manufacturer OnePlus.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.740]   It's a relatively new company.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.740]   He had teased.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.740]   That's the word.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.740]   Teased.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.620]   It has really nice specs.
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.620]   So it's wrong.
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.620]   Yeah, I can make up a phone with really nice specs too.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.740]   Why is Snapdragon 801, the Adreno 330 GPU.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.940]   This is, you could do this in your sleep.
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.540]   So that's the problem.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.420]   I, I'm skeptical.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.620]   I certainly wouldn't smash a phone, although I've got plenty lying around.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.620]   I could smash.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.940]   It's just such a bad idea.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:07.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.620]   Of course, it's attention grabbing, but it's just wasteful.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.620]   Yeah, we're covering it.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.820]   That everything's a do.
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.940]   Anyway, June 29.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.020]   Tony Wang has just texted.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.380]   He says, I entered, he's our editor.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.060]   I entered to destroy my phone.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.180]   I hope they don't pick me.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:27.340]   So you have, you don't have to destroy it until they pick you.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.380]   Yeah, I'm on the, I'm on the page and I was considering it too, but it just seems like
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.420]   such a first world like.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.420]   Yeah, it's gross.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   Yeah, it's gross.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   That's gross.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.780]   Absolutely absurd to destroy a phone.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:41.380]   A perfectly good phone.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.940]   It's incredibly offensive.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   It's disgusting.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.820]   It's wasteful and bad for the environment when you throw it out.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:50.700]   So can I give it to a homeless person instead?
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:57.180]   But I'm going to enter just in case, because if I win, I'll smell, okay, I have to tell
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.980]   them what I'm going to smash.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.940]   Wow.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.540]   Destruction method, you have to tell them, what should I do?
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:05.540]   Hammer, baseball bat, screwdriver, fire blender.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:12.900]   Leo, if it's, if it's, it's from the top of a very tall building.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:16.100]   No, that's going to hit somebody.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.420]   Now Leo, what phone would be most?
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.420]   I said the HTC one M7.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.260]   In a deserted area, by the way.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.980]   Yeah, me.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:27.380]   No, the M8s.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.060]   That's why I can do the M7.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.060]   Right.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.060]   I don't need it.
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.060]   I got the M8.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.060]   Okay.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.820]   That's why I actually have a dead, I have a dead M7.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   I could smash.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.820]   My point exactly.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.820]   Smash.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:41.860]   My Nexus 5 screen is a little cracked already, so I mean, it's going out the window.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:48.100]   Don't you dare, don't you dare, young Chad, not a Nexus 5.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.540]   I need a screen replacement.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.540]   I could give them so many old phones, a Galaxy S.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.300]   You could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.300]   three.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.100]   You could just give your phones to 20 friends and they could all get $1 phones.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.900]   Yeah, I should just give, I do give these away.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.060]   You know what I do?
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.820]   I like to surprise people.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.940]   I just put them under a chair and then I just wait.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:09.940]   Oprah.
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:10.940]   Yeah, like Oprah.
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:14.100]   And you get an old phone and you get an old phone.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.740]   So is the, now he's looking.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]   No.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.980]   Is Twitter dead?
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.940]   The Atlantic says the Twitter is the, is dead.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.860]   Adrian LaFrance and Robinson Meyer.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.860]   It is.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.220]   Twitter is not dead.
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:28.020]   I'm on Twitter every day.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.380]   Nothing is wrong with Twitter, but Twitter did have to report that their growth rate is
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.220]   slowed.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.220]   So what?
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:42.100]   Which set the stock down, you know, quite a tough, but S happens.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.380]   Twitter is not what it used to be, but I, you know what, we were talking before the show
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:54.860]   about my methodology, which is imitly connected with, with Twitter for gathering news.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:55.860]   I love Twitter.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:01.420]   When Tony said, just says, just said, you should look at the TOS, the terms of service
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.420]   before you enter.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.060]   Oh, no.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.580]   What have I done?
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.460]   I agree to the terms and conditions.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.580]   You may apply to break or damage your current phone if selected.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:17.780]   You will submit a video of yourself breaking your phone.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.820]   All right.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.980]   Contest entry, successful application.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:26.380]   All submitted videos must be shot in one frame with no cutting or editing.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.980]   The applicant must show that their phone does turn on and use the phone that was chosen
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.420]   by the applicant in their initial application.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.420]   The phone must suffer significant and visible damage to qualify for the one plus one purchase
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.420]   code.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:44.980]   The applicant must show evidence of the damage in the video following the smash.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.460]   This was such a bad idea.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:52.260]   Really terrible promotion.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.060]   But then there's that blender company, right?
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.060]   Will it blend?
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.060]   Blender tech blends everything.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.060]   That's true.
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.300]   It's a good way to do it.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.300]   I think it's a good way to do it.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]   I think it's a good way to do it.

[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:38.020]   If you're a good guy, you're a good guy.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:43.660]   The Chinese government has decided and the courts asked the question, "Why China?
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.380]   Are you censoring Big Bang Theory but not Game of Thrones?"
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.380]   I think it's a good way to do it.

[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:12.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:35.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:00.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:03.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:09.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:27.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:33.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:39.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:44.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:47.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:50.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:04.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:07.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:10.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:16.380]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   My question is, could I carry the
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   Nexus 7?
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.380]   I carry the Nexus 5?
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.380]   Would that replace both of them?
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.380]   Sure.
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.380]   I don't know.
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.380]   I have to say this is 6.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.380]   This is the Windows phone, the Enochia 1520
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.380]   that I was talking about.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.380]   It's great.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.380]   It's small enough that you can still put it in your pocket
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.380]   or your giant purse.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:37.380]   Look ridiculous.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   No, I don't think so.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.380]   It just looks like a pocket square.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.380]   Like I'm Dapper Dan.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.380]   Hey, hobo man.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.380]   Hey Dapper Dan.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.380]   You're always...
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   For me, being able to use it in one hand,
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.380]   that was supposed to now with the baby.
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.380]   You use this with one hand?
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.380]   Yeah, that's my son Jake's point.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.380]   Even my Nexus 5, he says it's too big for the hand.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   Moto X is...
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.380]   And presumably the new iPhone, which is 4.7 inches.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.380]   He is actually the sweet spot.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.380]   I think any smaller, any bigger...
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.380]   I find the iPhone to be dainty now.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.380]   Dainty, yeah.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.380]   Yeah, it feels really...
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   It's too small.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:12.380]   It's ridiculous.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.380]   It is.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.380]   Huh.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:17.380]   Zoni Z Ultra Google Play Edition.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.380]   I didn't know this was a big box as much.
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:20.380]   It didn't take it as much.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:21.380]   Well, I'm fascinated.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:25.380]   I didn't realize they were even offering this.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:30.380]   Oh, we did a really bad job with releasing this in the American market.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.380]   They did a horrible job.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.380]   They had no carrier partner show.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.380]   So I could use this with T-Mobile, right?
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.380]   It worked with LTE.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.380]   It looks like...
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.940]   That's the funny thing is that it could work on most of the carriers, but they just didn't
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.380]   make it happen fast enough.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.380]   It's compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile on their LTE.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:50.380]   So how's the screen resolution versus 1080?
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.380]   This is 5.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:53.380]   So it's about the same.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   Just 140...
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.380]   ...to 2 PPI pixels per inch.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.380]   It's good.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.380]   It's only 16 gigs.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.380]   The reason it's cheap is because it's maybe superannuated a little bit.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   It's old.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.380]   Why use one syllable when 6 will do?
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.380]   Superannuated.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   Do you guys think they'll be a play edition announced at IO?
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:20.860]   Well, now we didn't do this story, but apparently the silver editions are what they're calling
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:23.020]   the Nexus for future.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:27.900]   This is, by the way, if anybody's paying any attention at Google, what Microsoft thought
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.220]   they'd do with Windows, they did Windows signature PCs with none of the crap where...
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.180]   And this was a real problem in the Windows world.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:39.260]   You'd buy an HP and it'd be loaded with gigs of junk, trialware, crap.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:44.900]   You had to remove Microsoft thought, "Well, we want to give people a better Windows experience.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.420]   We'll make a signature edition."
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.380]   No manufacturer made one.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:49.380]   No one bought one.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.620]   You could barely find them.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.260]   It was a complete flop.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.380]   Even though it's apparent, this is obvious, this is what people would want.
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.900]   So I warned you, Google, this is dangerous.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:38:59.900]   This is...
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.020]   You think this is going to happen even with Google Play editions already kind of on their
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.020]   way?
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.020]   That's not that big.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]   Do they?
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   I wonder the Play editions.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.020]   I think that's what silver is about.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.300]   I think that silver is about bringing, getting consumers to buy what's essentially the Play
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.300]   edition or the Nexus now.
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:17.740]   So what's different about this is it's not sold at Play.Google.com, it's sold everywhere.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:18.740]   Sold in the stores.
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.380]   They've got associates doing the data transfer, doing the onboarding, creating your Google
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.100]   account for you, getting you set up.
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:28.420]   If they market it right and they get it into the right stores and they really make it kind
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.740]   of the premium Android experience.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:35.020]   I think that'll be good for everybody, right?
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:38.020]   Because right now there's a Samsung Android experience, right?
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.740]   There's an Amazon Fire OS, right?
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.740]   And Amazon, I mean, who knows?
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.380]   I don't think we didn't cover this story either, but if Amazon has a phone, if there's
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:49.220]   a prime contract, whatever, there's going to be some sort of Amazon flavor of Android.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.940]   There is one and it won't probably continue to go on handsets.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:56.460]   I mean, Google kind of needs to say, the Google experience is the superior Android experience
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.260]   and here's how you get it.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.260]   And it can't be...
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.260]   Which is fine, but here's my fear.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:06.460]   Here's my fear, Gina, is that what's going to happen is that we're going to...
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:10.780]   Don't forget the other thing Google did was make reasonably priced phones.
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:14.380]   And probably the manufacturers didn't like that, didn't like the price pressure on them.
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:20.820]   So now, yeah, the deal is we'll stop competing with you and showing you up if you use our
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.980]   software okay, but that means you can price the stuff through the roof again and charge
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.020]   700, 800 dollars for it.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:33.340]   I just think the real problem is that you can't compete with Samsung's massive marketing budgets.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:38.100]   I think it's provable that no one should buy a Samsung phone of any kind.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   It's just...
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.100]   They're horrible.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.780]   They're horrible.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   Even the play edition.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.780]   They're horrible.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.780]   You're going to get email about this.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:45.780]   Are you not?
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:46.780]   I think it's provable.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.780]   Samsung fans.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:48.780]   They're a galaxy fan.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:49.780]   They're wrong.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.780]   They're crazy.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.780]   They're nuts.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:52.780]   I'm with you, brother, but...
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.780]   It's nuts.
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:54.780]   I... well, no, I like the galaxy.
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.780]   The Galaxy S2 was very good.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.460]   After that downhill.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.860]   And really just now the stuff is crap-word.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:06.300]   But because they spend literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing,
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:10.980]   and it's going up all the time because it's directly tied to the profits made by the division.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:15.100]   So the more they make, the more they advertise, the more they advertise, the more they make.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.100]   You just can't compete.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:22.220]   And that's why the demonstrably superior HTC One, right, doesn't sell for beans.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.580]   No, you're right.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.980]   I think the silver will be very similar.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:29.580]   Google can't compete with Samsung's advertise.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.580]   I mean, they're...
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:39.180]   They could, but they're not going to spend $400 million to promote the silver edition.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.180]   Are they?
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.340]   They're running Chrome commercials.
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:42.340]   Yeah, but I...
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:43.340]   I don't know.
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:44.340]   What's the same?
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.340]   I hear you.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.260]   That would be weird.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.100]   I would notice.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:50.460]   It's hard to compete.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   It's really hard to compete.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.380]   And Android Silver commercial came on, I would be on my TV.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.780]   Yeah, I would stop the notice.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.340]   Are you ready?
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:00.020]   Are you ready for a number?
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:01.380]   Here's a number, Jeff.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.780]   Samsung's 2013 marketing budget.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.780]   What do you think?
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.780]   God knows.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.780]   $14 billion.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:10.780]   Oh, it's just...
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.180]   Good luck, Google.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:17.940]   And I know, I know people who work there, Samsung decides to do something.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:18.940]   The boss decides to do something.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:21.780]   And then, four weeks later, they got to watch.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.140]   Well, they got stuff.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:26.540]   Good luck, Google.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.540]   Oh, wow.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:28.540]   Working billion.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.260]   Well, that's what it says here.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.260]   That seems...
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.260]   Maybe that includes refrigerators.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]   I don't know.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:35.060]   I guess that's why, you know, I don't know.
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.660]   When I'm putting dots, I see an ad for the account.
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660]   Everywhere.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.660]   You can't get away from it.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:40.940]   It's everywhere.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.660]   This is a...
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:48.460]   I mean, this is from Boy Genius report.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:54.260]   According to Reuters, Samsung's marketing death star has spent an estimated $14 billion
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:43:00.260]   in 2013 and amount greater than the entire gross domestic product of Iceland.
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.260]   That's triple.
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:02.420]   The $4 billion it spent in 2012.
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:06.660]   And it's because Samsung, it's set up that the more you make, the more we...
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:15.100]   You know, the budget is tied directly to the sales.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:20.660]   I do the buy for Iceland.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.300]   Here's a chart.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:24.860]   And this is out of date.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:30.820]   This is Apple advertising, HP advertising, Dell advertising, Microsoft advertising, Coke,
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:37.020]   Samsung electronics, Samsung marketing expenses, dwarves, all of them combined.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.500]   Oh, Coke?
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.300]   More than Coke.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.460]   Like by a lot.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:44.900]   You should put some of that into better products.
[01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.340]   The purple one is 2012.
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:50.580]   So it's quadruple this.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.060]   Jeez.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.060]   And that's hard.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.540]   That's why people buy Samsung phones.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.140]   I'm convinced there's no other reason.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:59.140]   All right.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.180]   My pick of the week is a screensaver.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.900]   I want to thank my good friend Mike Elgin with whom from whom I get all of the information
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:08.220]   that I know everything I learn.
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.420]   I learn from Mike Elgin.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:21.100]   There's a great Google Trends website where you can see the search trends at google.com/trend/hottrend/visualize.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:24.620]   Well if you go there, now you'll be able to download a Macintosh screensaver which you
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.620]   can configure.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:30.380]   I've got it configured to show Google search trends in the United States in a four by four
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.420]   grid constantly updated.
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.340]   Now this is a screensaver.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.540]   Now you know what people are searching for.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:37.540]   That's neat.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.260]   That's my phone, apparently.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.260]   It's very windows-y.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:45.620]   Yeah, it's not available on Windows by the way.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.620]   More Linux.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620]   Flat.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:49.180]   Primary colors.
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.580]   Yeah, I like it though.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:53.220]   Amanda Knox, very popular right now.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.220]   Mean Girls.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.220]   So you can see what people are talking about.
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:58.700]   This is the 10th anniversary of Mean Girls.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.060]   Bob Hoskins just passed away.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.980]   Tony nominations.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:02.980]   Mean Girls quotes.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.180]   Now I wonder if I click on a, oh now it's put to sleep.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.420]   Hold on.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:10.420]   I guess I'll never be able to tell whether if I click on it.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.060]   This is the point cash problem.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:15.420]   Your point yes, you see a story.
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:16.420]   You click on it.
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:23.140]   But this is even if you don't, this is actually a fun site to go to the Google trends.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:27.380]   And then what you do is you have a, you can select how big a grid it is.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:29.460]   Somebody's searching for George Clooney right now.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.260]   This is the all regions search.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:34.300]   So it's more interesting if you pick a, pick your region.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:38.780]   And so hey, the number one search, Google Chrome right now.
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.100]   It's kind of fun.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.700]   A lot of people search for it.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.700]   I like the grid a lot.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:44.700]   Isn't that great?
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:45.700]   I love that.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.700]   A lot of people are looking for Beyonce.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.700]   Well, who isn't?
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:49.700]   Who is it?
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.700]   I get a new video.
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:51.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:53.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this weekend Google on Wednesday afternoons, 1 p.m. Pacific,
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:59.860]   4 p.m. Eastern time 2000 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.940]   But you don't have to watch live if you don't want to.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:03.460]   Look at that.
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:05.460]   It's primary colors.
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.940]   Surprising lack of logos in that.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:07.940]   I like that.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940]   That screen.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:12.580]   Yeah, but I was thinking, oh, this would be kind of a neat bumper for the show, but
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.340]   there's no indication that it's Google.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.100]   It's a good screen saver, I think.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.620]   Yeah, it is a good screen saver.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:22.540]   Not that it saves your screen, but who cares about that?
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:26.820]   If you want on demand versions of this show, just go to twit.tv/twig.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.180]   Or there's lots of podcast apps and so forth.

[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:56.180]   We're just following on Google+, he's still there.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:47:01.020]   Those genitrapani, she is at ThinkUp.com and you can now get your own ThinkUp.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.020]   Yeah!
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.020]   ThinkUp for yourself.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:04.020]   And you should.
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:05.820]   See, that's a good slogan.
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.940]   I just made a book of slogan.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:07.940]   Think up for yourself.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:08.940]   Think up for yourself.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:10.940]   I like it.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:11.940]   I like it.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:16.860]   You can see your analytics from Facebook and Twitter and see what your most valuable tweet
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:21.380]   was, how much you're tweeting, who's following you.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.380]   Five times.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.380]   You know what?
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:24.380]   Thank you.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:25.660]   Elizabeth Warren, you can thank me.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.100]   I increase the number of people seeing her tweet by 500%.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.540]   I want the number, though.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:32.700]   Gina, bring it back.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.780]   Bring back the number.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:37.420]   It's a multiple five times over the people that she reached.
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.420]   That's a pretty good video.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.420]   You're helping her out.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.420]   I'm helping her out.
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.420]   I like that.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.420]   Elizabeth Warren for Massachusetts.
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.060]   She's got to get a better twiddle handle.
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:51.620]   Elizabeth Forma, I guess there wasn't enough room for the whole state.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:52.620]   Look at that tweet.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.900]   That's the deal.
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:57.900]   That's my rants against Tom Wheeler did very well this one.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:58.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.500]   You're using a network for good here like this.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.300]   Only 15% of my status updates contained.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:06.500]   I mean mine or myself.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.500]   Nice.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.700]   This is good stuff to learn.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.100]   Isn't this great?
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:12.100]   LA Times editor and writer followed me.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   That's good.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.580]   She's the chief encouragement officer.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.580]   No.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.580]   LA Times.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.580]   Cheesy title.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:19.580]   Cheesy title.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:27.220]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.700]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:30.180]   Bye bye.
