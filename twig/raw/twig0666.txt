[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.080]   Hanging about them's back.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.160]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.120]   Aunt Pruitt is here.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.760]   And there is a lot to talk about right before the show began.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.040]   Meta made the announcement that their chief operating
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.120]   officer, Cheryl Sandberg, is stepping down after 14 years.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.680]   What does it mean for Meta and Mark?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760]   We'll talk about the Supreme Court rejecting the Texas
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   social media law, at least for now.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.080]   And then lots of fun with TikTok giant lobsters and a Google
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.040]   change log that isn't awful.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.280]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.080]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.640]   From people you trust.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.040]   This is Twig.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.280]   This is Twig.

[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.480]   It's time for TWIT this week in Google.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.760]   The show where we cover everything but Google
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   and intense, intense inspection of all stories
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.280]   with the fabulous Jeff Jarvis, who
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.720]   is the Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   at the crew.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.280]   at the City University of New York.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.880]   Hello.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   We're sending you a new camera.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.600]   Well, you asked us about this Lumina camera.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.640]   I asked you about a new camera.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.360]   And I thought, you guys, because you know everything,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.200]   I thought you'd know.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.280]   And the next thing I know, you're sending one my way,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.360]   which was not my intent.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   I swear.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   But thank you.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.960]   No, I knew about it because it was a Kickstarter or an Indiegogo
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.400]   or something.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.360]   And I looked at it.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.240]   And then apparently, you're going to get a complimentary--
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.760]   I can't wait.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.320]   I want to be the fly on the wall for this.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.120]   Yeah, I should record it.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.880]   Like, no, no, no.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.840]   You're still pink.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   A complimentary sight.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.840]   A complimentary sight.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.720]   You broke in our camera.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.120]   Let's see if they can get Jeff looking right.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   Can they get this white ballot?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.920]   He looks good today.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.880]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040]   Holy cow, it's Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.360]   There she is.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.920]   As I live in breeds.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.760]   And so does she.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.680]   Hello, y'all.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.120]   She lives in breeds.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.880]   Welcome back.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.760]   We miss you so darn much.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.840]   Stacy on IOT.com is the website.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.680]   He's thinking of you.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.960]   She was stuck at the Hotel Frisco.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   It was the Omni Hotel in Frisco.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.720]   No, but the Hotel Frisco sounds so much better.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.840]   It does sound so much better, right?
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.480]   For two weeks, quarantining.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.040]   But now you're safe to be out and about.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.080]   I am.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.960]   Well, I hope so.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.040]   I've tested negative.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.120]   Yay.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.360]   Just so we're so-- you really actually got it.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.400]   And you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.960]   I don't mind.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   I mean, I was tweeting throughout a huge portion of it.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   Because I'm like, I am so low.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.680]   I'm not revealing.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.480]   You're lonely in there.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.320]   I mean, how many times can you watch the office
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.360]   from beginning to end?
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.480]   You got it pretty bad, though.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.840]   You had a serious fever.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160]   It lost your sense of smell and taste.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   And you're--
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.520]   And you're vaccinated, right?
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720]   Yeah, I'm triple-vaxxed.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.360]   I actually wore a mask.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.120]   And--
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.920]   So just be aware, folks.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.560]   Be aware.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.160]   I still have a sinus infection.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.640]   So y'all, I sound so bad.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.440]   You too could be stuck for two weeks in the hotel frisco.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.160]   It's an eagle's song.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   It's good.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.640]   You'll like it.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.320]   Thankfully, I made it out.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.880]   And we also welcome back.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.360]   It's been a little bit of a dry spell here.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.840]   Aunt Pruitt's back from Hands-On Photography.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.320]   Yay.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.200]   Hey, Aunt.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Hey, sir.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.920]   How you be, sir?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.720]   It's good to see you.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.240]   Aunt is actually outsourced and found soundproofing materials
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.320]   in the clems and colors.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.880]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   I don't know how you did that.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.920]   Soundasure.com.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.640]   Oh, nice.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.200]   Wow.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.760]   There you go.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.000]   These guys value sound acoustic foam.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.280]   You know what?
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.160]   It sounds really good.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.240]   It sounds like you're just in this chamber,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.080]   the soundproof chamber.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.040]   It sounds really good.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.280]   Plus, there's no dogs in here snore next to me.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.960]   So that helps with the help of the clock.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   You actually Aunt Pruitt coming from the blade.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.000]   He actually sounds better there than he does when he's in studio.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.360]   That's kind of depressing.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.760]   Oh, well.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.880]   Well.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   Big story broke at 1 o'clock this afternoon, just an hour ago.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.200]   Cheryl Sandberg posted on Facebook
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.440]   she is leaving meta after 14 years.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.320]   Today I'm sharing the news that after 14 years I'll be leaving meta.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.480]   She says she didn't plan to stay this long.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.720]   When I joined Facebook, I had a two-year-old son
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   and a six-month-old daughter.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.280]   I didn't know if this was the right time for a new and demanding
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.320]   role, but I wanted to give it a try.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   She said, you know, I didn't expect
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.200]   to stay more than five years, but she's ended up there.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   Chief operating officer at meta, Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   woman for 14 years.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.120]   She went through, of course, the passing of her husband, Dave.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.760]   You know, with some real ups and downs.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.800]   And of course, the challenge of running a company that's
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.880]   under constant scrutiny from the feds and from the public,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.400]   the whistleblower and all of that survived all of that.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.280]   If she had left after five, six years,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.720]   she could have got out on some other things,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.840]   but now she has kind of Facebook kudos.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   She wrote a book called Lean--
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.200]   She has to work again?
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.480]   No, in fact, no.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.440]   Just in case you're interested, that's not which.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.720]   She's when I took this job in 2008, but I would hope--
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.080]   I hoped it would be in this role for five years, 14 years
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.280]   later.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.200]   It's time for me to write the next chapter of my life.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.440]   I'm not entirely sure what the future will bring,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   except giant bags of money.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.960]   I have learned no one ever is--
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.240]   no, that's kidding.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.880]   She didn't say that.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.240]   I've learned no one ever is, but I do know it will include
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.520]   focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.800]   which is more important to me now.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.720]   Because I have giant bags of money to give away.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.960]   Now then ever, given how critical this moment is for women,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.800]   I think that the timing may have something to do
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.000]   with Roe v. Wade, I don't know.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.040]   Also, she's getting married in the summer.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.760]   She says, as Tom and I get married this summer,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.640]   parroting our expanded family of five children.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.360]   Our next few months, Mark and I will transition
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.120]   my direct reports.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.480]   I'll leave the company this fall.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.480]   She will stay on the board.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   Oh, she's going to run for office, y'all.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   Oh, I was wondering, do you think she can?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.000]   Do you think she can?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.280]   She has too many Facebook goodies?
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.920]   No, she'll go some ways.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   Do you think both cooties are a thing?
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.160]   She missed the California primary,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560]   so she won't be on the ballot--
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   Oh, she's got an open.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.400]   It just takes time.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.280]   It would have to be a national office.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   It would have to be a 20 to--
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.040]   She could be a 20 to do, like--
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.960]   Replace Diane.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.120]   Is that it?
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.920]   God, that would have to be a nice thing.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   That might be the path, because Diane Feinstein is getting
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.000]   on, and it might be that she retires early.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.680]   And Gavin Newsom, who I'm sure Sheryl Sandberg has very good
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.280]   ties with, would appoint her.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.120]   And that would eliminate an election.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.680]   And then she'd have a couple of years
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320]   to serve in the Senate before she had a run for office.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.160]   That would be very interesting.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.640]   Huh.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.360]   Do you think she might?
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.600]   I don't think there would be as such thing as Facebook
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.680]   cooties as Mr. John--
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.480]   You don't think so.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.720]   No, I mean, considering how the rest of the government
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.040]   bodies have been put into office here,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.600]   regardless of their history and past or whatever,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.720]   none of that stuff matters.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.920]   It's just, can you scratch the back of the right lobbyists
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.560]   at the right time kind of thing?
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.320]   Also, name recognition is probably--
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.040]   I would have to say she has name recognition.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.200]   Yeah, but more important than anything,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.640]   especially with women.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.440]   Lean In was a very popular, very best-selling book
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:57.400]   about how women should move forward in business and the world.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.760]   So yeah, I do think politics is in her future.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   So--
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   I'll just have one more.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.440]   --good to have another.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.920]   She could also be appointed to some federal position,
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   ambassador to somewhere or something.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.000]   I think she wants something more than that.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.080]   I think she wants something with some clout.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.840]   Well, we could look up, because it's public records,
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.080]   Sheryl Sandberg's political contribution record.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.920]   Survey says.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   Well--
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   I mean, we could.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.400]   Facebook's-- most of Facebook's lobbying efforts
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.280]   are very right-wing, so it would kind of be interesting.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:40.600]   She contributed quite a bit to Nancy Pelosi,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.880]   to Women Making History 2016.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.120]   Zollofgren, Act Blue, Amy Klobuchar, Hillary Victory Fund,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.920]   very Democrat.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.000]   Bennett Colorado, Victory Fund, Leahy for Senator Committee.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.960]   This is just in 2016.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.640]   I think the total is more than half a million.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.080]   Is that right?
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.920]   $729,000 in--
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.600]   wait a minute, I can't-- the dollar sign
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.240]   is in a strange position on this.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.760]   I don't--
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.600]   Because it's so far away from that.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.240]   There it is.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.320]   Have you seen that many of these?
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.880]   Like, I donated $72.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.440]   You broke it.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.880]   I get it.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.600]   171 donations in 2020, totaling $729,000.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.840]   2018, 425, the year before half.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.360]   So 2020, I'm curious to see.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.880]   What was that?
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.120]   Should we look at 2020s?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   All right.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.800]   I have to move ahead.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.520]   1900.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.280]   In January 1, 1900, she gave money to Finkan Hour.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.160]   There's something there appears to be an error in this database.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.640]   This database.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   Wow.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.040]   2020--
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.680]   It was not adapted for Y2K.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.400]   Wow.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.200]   I clicked the link.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.360]   I clicked the link.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.560]   Anna Eschou, who's Democrat, acts blue with Democrat.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.320]   Yeah, Eschou's at District.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.480]   Tina Smith from the answer.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.720]   And Terry trying to go after tech.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.320]   These are all the maximum, by the way, $2,800.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.240]   She gave the Facebook pack some money.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   Nancy Pelosi.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.480]   So yeah, very much liberal.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.200]   Women vote, Chris Coons in Delaware.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.920]   So yeah, I don't see, though, interestingly, Gavin Newsom.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.440]   But maybe I'm looking at it in a long year.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.640]   Is that just federal or--
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   It's everything.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.600]   This is-- it's all public record.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:34.840]   I know.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.000]   What is it just-- is there a separate listing for local,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   for state?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.280]   The separate reporting.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.440]   This is all estate.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.600]   But no, this is all over the country.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.100]   Let me see.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.760]   No, but I'm saying these are federal offices,
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   as opposed to--
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.400]   Those are federal offices, as opposed to state offices.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:51.920]   Oh, I see.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.600]   I see what you're saying.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.760]   So there may be separate reporting for a state office.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.800]   State office, OK.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.840]   I don't know.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.280]   Jackie Speer, People for Ben.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:04.760]   Anyway.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.200]   Ben who?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.320]   Ben and Jerry, come on, get with it.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.480]   We only need first names here.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.600]   She talks about Mark throughout her post.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.160]   And Tom, her fiance, who at first I thought was my space, Tom.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.080]   But it turns out--
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.240]   Well, who wasn't she was dating, who got in trouble recently?
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.480]   But she was trying to--
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   Yeah, Cott's correct.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.760]   Yeah, the CEO of Activision.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.400]   Activision, yeah.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.880]   Yeah, Cott can--
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.760]   That was not meant to be.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.560]   She is engaged and will marry Tom Berenthal, who--
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.480]   Berenthal, who's the founder of a marketing company,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.320]   Kelton Global.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.360]   She met through her brother-in-law, Rob.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.800]   They'll have a blended family of seven.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.600]   Brother-in-law being--
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.840]   Dave's brother.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.880]   Dave's brother.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.080]   Wow.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.680]   Her ex is-- not ex--
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.440]   For her late husband's brother.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.880]   Late husband's.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.320]   So that's kind of nice.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.640]   That's kind of nice.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.880]   Did you read Mark's post yet?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.840]   No, let's see.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.280]   What does Mark say?
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.520]   It looks like a consolidation of power.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.880]   He's not going to replace Cheryl.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.760]   He'll be a COO, but not a Cheryl COO, a pure Revitos COO.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.120]   More stuff reports to Mark.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.160]   Remember when Nick Clegg took over global affairs,
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.600]   we kind of thought, oh, this is a triumvirate.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.440]   Mark runs the technical side.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.960]   Cheryl, my name.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.040]   Cheryl runs the operations, and then Nick
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.360]   runs the outward-facing government relations.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.200]   So that's interesting.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.560]   Without Cheryl--
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   He says, well, it's more--
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.080]   With Cheryl, join me--
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   It's all a nation of power with Mark.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.920]   I was only 23 years old, and I knew barely anything
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.200]   about running a company.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.520]   Cheryl architected our ads business, hired great people,
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.960]   forged our management culture, taught me how to run a company.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.600]   Seymour Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.000]   Try logging in or creating a new account, Leo.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   No.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.960]   No.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.560]   Look how big that is, by the way.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.400]   That's what it takes over half the page.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.960]   Slap.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.440]   This is for those just listening.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.240]   I am reading a Facebook post, but I do not have an account.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.800]   So Facebook is--
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.840]   It's a lower third.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.440]   It's literally a lower third of the screen.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.960]   Really?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.440]   Yes.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.080]   Sign in.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.600]   Sign off.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   Come on.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.720]   Shmuck.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.840]   One of the greatest legacies the incredible team
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.480]   Cheryl has built.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.520]   Nick Clagg is president of Global Affairs, Jennifer
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.760]   Nusd, chief legal officer.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.440]   Harvey, which is Javier Olivan, he runs--
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   let's see.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.280]   Talk to us for Instagram and Facebook.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:32.920]   OK, yeah.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.840]   He's the revenue guy.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.080]   Right.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.000]   Actually, he's been in the news lately with Instagram.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.960]   He'll become the next COO where he'll
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.640]   lead the integrated ads and business products,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.000]   in addition to leading infrastructure integrity.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.680]   Just a little job.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.960]   Analytics, marketing, corporate development,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.360]   and growth teams, baby boy.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:51.880]   Jeez.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.040]   Harvey, I'll be getting a big--
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.160]   But he's not Cheryl.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.000]   But this role will be different from what Cheryl has done.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.400]   It'll be more traditional COO role
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.480]   where he'll be focused internally and operationally.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.760]   I think Mark really has already moved his attention
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.560]   to VR, to the metaverse.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.080]   Man's.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.320]   So I really think that who's running the old legacy
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   business is no longer that important to me, I would guess.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.080]   As part of this Molly Cutler, our VP
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.560]   Strategic Responsible Join Havi's team
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.600]   and report to Naomi Glite.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.080]   Justin Osofsky will report to Chris Cox, who you remember,
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.200]   came back.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.480]   He's one of the founders of Facebook.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.840]   So it is a bit of a reorg.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.240]   This will happen this fall.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.960]   But I really wonder how much Mark worries about Facebook
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.920]   anymore.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.880]   How important is that?
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.400]   He's really--
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.720]   Because it has CUTIs.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:43.920]   Right.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.680]   He has many CUTIs.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.000]   You should worry about it because it's going
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.160]   to generate all of his revenue to--
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.640]   It's like AOL was, which surprisingly--
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.160]   But what about--
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.600]   Do you think-- I think maybe Cheryl--
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.400]   And he kind of planned this saying--
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.640]   Cheryl's saying, we're going to wind down Facebook.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   Metaverse is the next big thing.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.880]   I don't want to really kind of start up in that project.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.960]   Why don't you give Havi the day-to-day operations?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.560]   You can focus your--
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.280]   What did they say?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.800]   18,000 engineers in $10 billion a year building
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.760]   this new metaverse.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.960]   Focus on that.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.520]   And Havi will keep things--
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.000]   keep the engine running so we can have funds.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.840]   Nick will send off--
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.920]   So Stacey, do they recognize just what you just
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.440]   said a minute ago?
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   Do they recognize that maybe it is AOL?
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   And the smart thing to do is to--
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.720]   That's what I think.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.160]   Is to just let it kind of just--
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.240]   like AOL, people keep bringing in some money, lots of money,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.920]   but it's going to feed their next ambition.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.680]   I mean, yeah.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.000]   And AOL still had to manage the dial-up business as it were.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.640]   So--
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.440]   They still do, I think, technically.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.640]   The other still pays $4.95 a month to them.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.480]   I'm a scared of canceling.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.440]   So yeah, this is a big change.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.520]   I have to think this is not a surprise to Mark.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.560]   And that this is probably something they planned.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   And maybe even is a beginning of--
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.840]   She stayed on the board.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.520]   That's very important.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.280]   She stole the board.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.780]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.360]   If you're doing something like this,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.800]   she probably told him, like, a year ago, hey, I'm getting itchy
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.600]   feet.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.920]   Let's figure that-- I mean, when you're the CEO, you are a COO,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.120]   when you're part of the Trampert, you have a plan.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.040]   I've always thought that Mark wanted
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.760]   had a political ambitions, but Cheryl makes much more sense,
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.280]   really.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.960]   She's more palatable than Mark.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.040]   She feels like she likes people, for instance.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.640]   I'm sorry, Anne.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.400]   I can't do it all the more.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   She identifies as a person?
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.840]   Yes, she identifies as a person.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.920]   Human.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.680]   Human.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.880]   Would the operations officer deal a little bit more tightly
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.280]   with the general counsel?
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.400]   Because you know there's more stuff probably just out
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   and in someone's hidden newsfeed that says, hey, we caught
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.600]   so and so doing this on that platform.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.400]   We caught this executive--
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.680]   I think Nick--
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.600]   of course Nick--
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   Probably Nick Cleggs.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.840]   Does the run interference with government?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.400]   That's really his story.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.040]   He's policy and Combs.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   He's like, yeah.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.840]   But you're right.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   Javier would have to keep an eye on that.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.760]   He'd have his eyes on that.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.720]   But policy would probably wouldn't come from him.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.200]   In the structure, you're right, Anne,
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.000]   to focus on Chief Counsel.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.240]   What do you think maybe Elon Musk should buy Facebook?
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.280]   Would he more than 40--
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.520]   Elon Musk should not do anything else.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.360]   He needs to take a nap.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.120]   Take a nap, my lord.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.400]   Like a toddler.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.320]   You need to take a nap.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.880]   You need to take a nap.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.760]   You missed two key Elon weeks before.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.480]   Oh, man.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.960]   I was so glad.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.200]   I was just like, oh, I'm going to wake up.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   This is all going to be over.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.560]   But it's still happening.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.400]   Oh, yeah, it never ends.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   It's still happening.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.320]   It's still happening.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.080]   But you saw the memo that he set up to executives.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.360]   I haven't been online for the last 10 to 12 days.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.440]   What have you been doing?
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.360]   I'm doing the same thing.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.000]   Who?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.680]   I've been--
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.640]   Have you been in a cold look?
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.720]   I've been watching reruns of Archer and Parks and Rants
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.120]   and I'm so jealous.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.960]   I did my very best to disconnect,
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.640]   because I was supposed to have been working a gig
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.000]   and I canceled.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.080]   So I said, I'm a disconnect.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.960]   I didn't even watch the show last week,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.840]   even though I normally would.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   But I was like, I got to step away from work.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.840]   And I couldn't tell you the first thing that's
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.560]   been really going on, other than all the devilance and stuff
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.880]   that's been happening recently.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.640]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.280]   I don't need to tech news.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.720]   I tried to--
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.880]   Yeah, we've been trying to avoid talking about it,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.280]   because it's so horrific and it's so depressing.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.360]   I wake up every morning depressed.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.400]   So I understand.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.320]   I really understand.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.600]   I'm jealous that you got to unplug.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.840]   Unfortunately, you don't really get to unplug, do you?
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.760]   That stuff follows you around.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.800]   So I worked really hard to try to disconnect these last couple
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.560]   days and I felt bad thinking, oh, man, my first day back
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.560]   to work is the day of twig, where I'm supposed to be reading.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.200]   No, no, no, no.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.280]   All it is a wonderful information that Mr. Howell has put
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.640]   into our rundown that you never even get to.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.920]   You do not really need to read it.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.520]   I just want your deep, heartfelt reaction
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.000]   to anything we say.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   And if it's blessed--
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.120]   I didn't--
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.960]   Bless his heart, that's fine.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.160]   This is the evil episode you know.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   This is the evil episode.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.080]   I see.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.360]   666.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.720]   I put that there.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.720]   Oh my god.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.920]   I'm glad I came back for this.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.600]   Thank God that's not Friday the 13th.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.960]   Then we'd really be--
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.680]   Zorgon is going to take over Leo's chair any minute.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   I'm Gozon.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.480]   Thank you, Maxie.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.760]   Well, Elon has a message for you, Ant.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.400]   Oh boy.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.800]   Remote work is no longer acceptable.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   This is a--
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.880]   Oh boy.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.080]   --email sent to the entire staff electric, got it.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.600]   Anyone who wishes to do remote work
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.040]   must be in the office for a minimum.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.800]   And I mean minimum of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.480]   This is less than we ask of factory workers.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.880]   If there are particularly exceptional contributors
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.920]   for whom this is impossible, I will
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   review and approve those exceptions directly.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.720]   Wait, wait.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.440]   You're supposed to work 37 and a half hours.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.960]   He's asking for more time than people
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.680]   should put in as a minimum.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.080]   Moreover, the office must be a main Tesla.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.320]   Office not remote branch offices
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.680]   unrelated to your job duties.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.760]   For example, being responsible for Fremont
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.800]   factory human relations but having your office be
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.720]   in another state.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.160]   Thanks, Elon.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.640]   Second email, subject to be super clear.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.800]   Every-- by the way, he said, you know, I only spend 5% of my time
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.640]   on Twitter.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.720]   So clearly, he's got the bandwidth to be writing this.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.600]   Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.480]   in the office per week.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.880]   Well, this is kind of reiterating.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.480]   The more senior you are, the more visible
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.600]   must be your presence.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.160]   That's why I lived in the factory so much,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.960]   so that those in the line could see me working alongside them
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.120]   and saying, is he still here?
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.320]   Get rid of him.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.880]   If I had not done that Tesla long ago,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.920]   I would have gone bankrupt.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.880]   There are, of course, companies that don't require this,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.640]   but once the last time they shipped a great new product,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.360]   it's been a while.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.280]   Who's he talking about?
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.640]   Boy.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.440]   Yeah, it has been.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.520]   As Elon, it's been a while.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   It's been a--
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.600]   Nobody has shipped a great new product in--
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.400]   Ever?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.920]   Tesla has and will create and actually
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.720]   manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.280]   of any company on Earth.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.880]   This will not happen by phoning it in.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.920]   He is scared.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.480]   Scared or angry?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   No, angry.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.240]   I think he needs a nap.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   I think Stacy's right.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.560]   He looks like someone who is going a little unhinged.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.880]   And I don't need a slightly--
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.320]   I feel that--
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.880]   No, no, that's serious.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.640]   And I worry about him because you're right.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.080]   I don't know if I'm worried, but I do think--
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.040]   I get incredibly--
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.280]   I'm one of his close friends.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.360]   He's hanging out there and saying, look, this is what we require.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.240]   We want our folks here.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.800]   We're not doing hybrid.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   We're not doing remote.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.120]   This is it, bottom line.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.000]   So it is not raw.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.200]   Wish you watching anything, especially when people are looking
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.680]   for work.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.800]   They know what the expectations are.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.040]   And for some people, it's a very small percentage of people.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.720]   They're fine with going to the office.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.560]   Says Aunt.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:25.960]   Yeah, that's huge.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   Let's promote today.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Who's at home?
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   Oh, by the way.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.240]   Yeah, just look.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.960]   For those who are listening, that's where Aunt is.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.760]   Just say it out.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.520]   I didn't say I was in this.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.120]   No, we're very easy going here.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.920]   You're never going to get a memo like that for me.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.800]   And we have a four-day work week.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.920]   And we're still pretty much hybrid.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.800]   It's up to you.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.640]   And--
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.680]   Binance at a job listing.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.120]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   Because you want to work for Binance?
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.520]   I think it says it all here.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.480]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   No, I don't.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.360]   In fact, after reading this job listing, I'm afraid.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.400]   I'm very afraid.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.200]   I'm not going to be able to find it.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.480]   But it basically said, what do you want?
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.200]   Just said, really.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.960]   Don't think you can work here.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.640]   Work a 40-hour week.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.760]   That's not how we--
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.800]   That's the old Disney joke.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.280]   What was that?
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.360]   You don't come in on Saturday.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.960]   Don't bother coming in on Sunday.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.920]   Exactly.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.120]   Do you think that's necessary?
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.720]   Do you think that really makes a difference?
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.880]   Apple does it.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.120]   Technology companies do it historically.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.320]   Cheryl's story.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.120]   Her post.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.920]   Go ahead, dad.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.520]   It depends on leadership.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.840]   There's some folks that feel like you have to have these--
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.800]   But is the leader right?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.560]   No.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.840]   If they have the proof and the put in it says,
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.160]   hey, B in here has been productive
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.360]   and allowed us to produce X product with X amount
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.760]   of return on investment.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.160]   Yadda, yadda, yadda, and share.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.040]   But you're very generous.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.360]   Well, I just give a lot of that.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.800]   Yeah, I think that's a fantasy.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.000]   And I think there's a lot of evidence that, in fact,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.800]   working that hard does not promote better work or--
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.840]   I don't think American's can really--
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.720]   But I don't--
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.200]   Go ahead.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.000]   I'm sorry, Miss Stacy.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.880]   No, you go ahead.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.240]   You go ahead.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.680]   No, I was saying I agree with Miss LaPour.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.240]   That it's a bit of a fantasy, but at the same time,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.560]   I also respect the fact that someone could say,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.000]   hey, these are my values for the workplace.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.320]   And if you want to work here, we're happy.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.840]   Oh, sure.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.000]   But if you don't want these, then--
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.800]   I completely agree.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.880]   It's their right.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   It's their right to say that.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.680]   I just don't know if they are right to say that.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.720]   Stacy.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.040]   I was going to say, I think it's kind of a function
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   of how productive you want to be as a company.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   Obviously, if you are working--
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.360]   I mean, yes, there's a point where it stops.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.000]   But I don't work 40 hours a week anymore,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.160]   because I don't have to to make what I feel is a decent living.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.000]   And I would say the compromise there
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.520]   is if you're a company that's like, yeah,
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.360]   I want my company to be OK.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.680]   It's going to grow at this rate.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.480]   I'm cool with that versus a more hard driving culture.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.200]   And honestly, I don't think Americans are really
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.880]   the right people to talk to about this,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.880]   because we have been indoctrinated whole life
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.160]   into like--
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.440]   we are really crazy.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.600]   When I talk to my friends, it almost anywhere else
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.240]   with the exception of my friends in China
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.000]   and some of them in Japan.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.800]   They're just like, what is wrong with y'all?
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   Here's the finance from the recruitment site
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.480]   about the company.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.680]   At Binance, we don't work.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.040]   We live it.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.960]   No one ever asks you to work overtime or checks
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.640]   if you show up late in the morning.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.520]   Those concepts don't apply at Binance.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.880]   We do whatever it takes to get whatever needs getting done.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.360]   It ends up being a lot of overtime.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.920]   We are always working.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.040]   There's no off switch if you have your sleeves rolled up
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.200]   and ready to sweat it for the long haul
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.600]   and be part of a team that will help
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.560]   to define finance for the world tomorrow, then read on.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.520]   If not, you can save your lazy bum some reading.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   Wow.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.800]   You know, part of that is crypto is kind of like a weird cult
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   mentality anyway.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.160]   So that kind of ties into that, you know.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.320]   By the world view.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.360]   I guess if you're going to get stock options and get rich,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.320]   you might be willing to sacrifice your family life,
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.760]   your humanity, your sleep for something.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.120]   I mean, you get rich, I guess.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.600]   Maybe that's worse than--
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.680]   That's not mentality, right?
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.000]   And then, for some people, it's like creating the Mac
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.200]   or some great thing.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.960]   But for most people, all they're doing
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.160]   is giving up their family life, their real life, their world.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.600]   So somebody else can get rich, right?
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.880]   That's that weird American, like, they
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.080]   have a calling to do this.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.400]   And, you know, very few people, very few jobs
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.880]   are a job that you could say have a calling, right?
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.520]   But we tend to want people to work like that.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.720]   I think actually, at a certain point in time,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.120]   it might work for a lot of people.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.960]   Like when you're young and hungry and coming out
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.880]   and if you're, like, really interested in learning
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.120]   a lot really fast, I think that fits.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.560]   But I don't think that that's how everyone would like it to be.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.960]   And I think if that's the way the world were for everywhere
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.120]   and everyone, that would be horrible.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.160]   From Isabel Asher Hamilton writing today in Business Insider,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.120]   Elon Musk said, working from home during the pandemic
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.800]   tricked people into thinking they don't need to work hard.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.840]   He's dead wrong, economists say.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.640]   Working from home does not make workers less productive.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.000]   According to three economists, the insider interviewed.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.400]   The only constraint on productivity
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.920]   was when workers had children at home,
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.400]   they needed to look after.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   There's a lot of evidence, in fact, that working at home--
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   here's the Natasha Postol-Vene, an economic and financial
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.480]   historian at the London School of Economics.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.680]   Most of the evidence shows that productivity has increased
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.920]   while people stayed at home.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.720]   People spent less time commuting,
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.200]   so they could use some of that time to work.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.720]   They got to spend more time with their family and sleeping,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.240]   which meant they were happier, and ended up being more productive.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.480]   You know, I'm reminded of when I last had a salary job,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.160]   and it was a really good salary, I will say.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.080]   I would sit there some days, and this is really why I chose to quit.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.440]   I would sit there some days, and I would say,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.160]   I haven't done much of anything of value to this company today.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.840]   Paid me this much money today, and I didn't actually do any,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.240]   because I had to sit here on my rump, because that's what we do.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.520]   And that was so disturbing, right?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   As opposed to thinking I could get something done.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.560]   Who hasn't had--
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.920]   Who worked in an office?
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.200]   Hasn't had that experience where, you know, first some guy comes over,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.280]   asks you how your weekend was, and then you got to go to a meeting,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.800]   in which you have nothing to add, and then it's lunchtime,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.280]   and you got a couple of martinis, because the boss, you know, was drinking.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:13.920]   Back of the day.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.360]   Boy.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.840]   By the end of the day, you got one last minute.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   One of the meetings were great.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.080]   You missed that part.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.160]   You did as a--
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.720]   We had Korean for lunch.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.400]   You could have had Korean, and it'd come on in.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.560]   That's our way of bribing people to get them into the meeting.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.120]   Lisa likes to have people around.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.000]   She's very social, and she-- and for her in the work she's doing with the people
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.920]   she's working with, our sales team, our marketing team, our continuity team,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.240]   having them there so that there's some back and forth,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.640]   and she can say, what's this?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.600]   It's more efficient for her.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.080]   And I understand that.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.560]   I don't think our hosts work better here than they would work at home.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.920]   Our producers don't work better here than they work at home.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.480]   Our editors need the equipment here, but they've been working at home a lot,
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   and it's been working fine.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.000]   So from my way more productive here in my studio.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.320]   I would think so.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.720]   Way more productive.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.040]   So we missed talking to you--
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.560]   Most of my adult life, you know, is just sort of built into--
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.640]   When you worked as an IT, you kind of have to be there, right?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   Unless all the servers are in your house.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   I was going to say that.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.920]   I mean, that cable right there.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.280]   I was at home most of the time in my IT world, because everything was right.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.680]   Oh, connected if I needed to.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.200]   There you go.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.960]   You didn't need to be.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.040]   Again, I got more done because I didn't have people walking up asking me if I watched
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.960]   the game, when they know I already watched the game.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   Right.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   You know?
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.040]   You told that story about your convince of your boss, let you go home and work,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   and it worked better.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.160]   Yeah, I did.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.720]   I did.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.120]   And the boss was like, well, OK.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.760]   Well, since you're sending me this email at 2 in the morning--
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.640]   I guess that's proof.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.720]   To stay in the morning.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.680]   I always send everyone's emails in the middle of the night.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   And you learned how to put the time to email.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.200]   That could be it.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.320]   I'm such a good programmer that I learned to send the email out while I was snoring.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.920]   But yeah.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   I work for-- you know, I work for iHeart doing the radio show by Premiere.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.960]   And my boss is the president of Premiere.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.880]   I'm baffled.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.720]   I will send her an email.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.120]   I sent her an email memorial day at 11.48 PM.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.800]   Before midnight, she'd responded.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.720]   I mean, with the minutes, she responds instantly.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.520]   And I'm almost now.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.720]   It's almost a game.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.680]   And I think that's partly because the CEO of iHeart, Bob Pittman,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.240]   is kind of that kind of guy.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.320]   Where are you?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.120]   If you didn't--
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.960]   I used to work with him.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.080]   I sent you an email where you didn't respond.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.680]   Are you-- what are you doing?
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.280]   Mowgles.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:40.760]   Sleeping.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.880]   He's a mogul.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.520]   There you go.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.040]   It's Mowgle Woman's interesting.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.280]   He's one of those people who only need four hours of sleep
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   and don't understand everyone else.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.600]   And I loved Julie.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.000]   You would love Julie because she's a country.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   They're out of Nashville.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.640]   And she's very relaxed and friendly and country.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.920]   And she's just the sweetest person.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.560]   And I kind of feel bad for her because I'm sure she'd
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.480]   like to have a mint jule of about 5.30 PM.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.560]   And just for the last--
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.440]   That's Kentucky, sir.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.440]   That's good.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:09.940]   Oh, that's right.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.440]   What do they drink?
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:10.840]   Oh, thank you.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   And I see old, good old Jack Daniels.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.640]   I'd like a little--
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.440]   I'd like a little-- yeah, a little Lynchburg liquor.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.160]   And just relax, put my feet up on the barrel,
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.800]   and watch the hand dog sleep.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.640]   OK.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.960]   I'm button the top button on a bridge.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.640]   I don't know if you've ever been to Nashville, man.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.140]   No.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.720]   No, it's not like that at all.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.760]   I know, I know.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.120]   Nash Vegas is more like that.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.840]   Everybody's making it.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.640]   Everybody's doing it.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.840]   They're going--
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.880]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.640]   We will talk about another huge story.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.080]   It's funny, this is normally a dead season,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.440]   because of summer breaks and stuff,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.680]   but some of the biggest stories of the week.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.360]   I've come out in the last couple of days, Supreme Court rules
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   on the Texas social media law.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.460]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.720]   And then, of course, we're going to spend an hour and a half
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.680]   talking about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.400]   But next--
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.680]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.280]   This teasing--
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.680]   Iptilon musk.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.000]   But actually, Elon Musk is the Depp Heard trial
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.320]   of the tech industry, isn't it?
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.960]   It's the thing that you can't look away from.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.520]   I did.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.640]   I looked at it from all of it.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   I did not-- one minute.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   Not one minute.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.600]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.240]   Well, you were imprisoned.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.080]   Is he-- what do they else do?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.680]   You know what he says?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.480]   Oh, no, but I avoided it like the plague.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.160]   Yeah, he did.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.680]   It was hard, but I did.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.880]   I can't wait.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.480]   We were going on a cruise.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.920]   It's going to be fun to Alaska with the Twit fans 100 strong.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.400]   It's a little more than a month, about six weeks off.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.520]   And I don't know about you, but when I'm going on a cruise,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.960]   I start to think about my wardrobe.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.360]   And that's why I went to our sponsor, Indoshino.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.680]   And I got myself some cruise wear.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.040]   I have-- I almost don't want to say it.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.520]   For those of you who are going on the cruise,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.840]   I know a few of you are in our chat room and our club
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.640]   and our Twitter chat.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.240]   I have some of the things I got from Indoshino.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.640]   I can't wait to-- I have a purple velvet dinner jacket
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.840]   with satin lapels.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   It's so beautiful.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   I can't wait.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   A tuxedo.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   I'm going to wear a tuxedo.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   That'll be my tuxedo.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.960]   And now, it's not the only thing you can get in Indoshino.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:35.040]   Indoshino is actually a great place to shop for any kind of event,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.080]   you're going to be a groom in a wedding party,
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.640]   a lucky guest.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.440]   Weddings are coming up, wedding season this month.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.720]   You want to look your best for a wedding?
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.280]   Look at these.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.400]   I mean, they are so sharp.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.560]   I wore-- actually, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.040]   I wore my purple silk jacket, which I found out it looks--
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.520]   it's just like silk, but it's actually wool,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.400]   but it's just beautiful.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.040]   It's silky, smooth.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   And here's the thing.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.800]   It's like it is, in fact, having a custom tailor.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.440]   Because your suits come from Indoshino.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.560]   When you get measured, you can either go to Indoshino
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.280]   and get measured, or go to a tailor,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.720]   get measured, or measure yourself.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   But they fit perfectly like a glove.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   They're tailored.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.080]   It's not XL, XXL.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.600]   Not that.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.040]   They're tailored perfectly for your proportions.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.280]   So you look great, you feel confident.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.840]   Sometimes when you get dressed up,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.800]   you feel like it's uncomfortable.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.320]   Like you don't belong in these clothes.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.960]   You belong.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.920]   When you put on your Indoshino suits or jackets or shirts
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.880]   or pants, you feel like they belong.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.680]   Every detail is perfect, customized to your desires.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.480]   Suit, shirt, dinner, jacket.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.880]   And the price is, given that these are completely 100%
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.440]   custom tailored, are really good.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.040]   Every suit made to your measurements,
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.320]   you can customize every detail.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.280]   Monograms, fabrics, you can get great statement linings.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.400]   And yes, they're not all purple velvet jackets.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.840]   They have a whole variety of subtle looks as well.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.080]   But it's nice to have a choice.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.160]   Indoshino suits, custom tailored.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   Started $429, shirts from $79.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.560]   Custom fitted shirts, casual wear.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.400]   You'll get a wardrobe personalized to your taste
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.680]   without spending a fortune.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.160]   You know, I was gonna save this dinner jacket
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.200]   for the cruise, but maybe I'll break it out
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.600]   over the next few days 'cause it's so beautiful.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.200]   I love it so much.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.400]   And they're always adding new pieces and options.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.680]   So I always go back to the site, look at that white suit.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.920]   I might have to order that.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.440]   Oh, and once they have your measurements, you know,
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.080]   you can of course, they guarantee it,
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.280]   the fit's guaranteed.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.240]   So you can, if you get it and it doesn't fit,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.720]   you can set it back or have it adjusted.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.600]   That's not a problem.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.120]   But once they get it right, which they have,
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.960]   they have my exact measurements now.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   They just wanna go on the site and go,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.640]   yeah, I wanna white suit.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.440]   Sure.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.200]   They're always adding new stuff.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.480]   You can always stay in trend.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.640]   It's very, it's definitely stylish.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.680]   You won't feel frumpy.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.480]   They have a relaxed yet refined approach to spring suits.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.280]   Their new spring pastels are coming out.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.240]   Spring, summer too.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.880]   And I think the fall collection is just about,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.800]   just about to come out.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.960]   If you've got a big day coming up,
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.360]   getting the perfect look is no big deal with Indo-Chino.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.720]   I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.880]   If you get $50 off any purchase of $3.99 or more,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   just use the promo code TWIT@inducino.com.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.240]   I love my Indo-Chino suits.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.040]   $50 off any purchase of $3,199 or more.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.920]   I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O.com promo code TWIT.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.880]   You will see me wearing these in the cruise.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.400]   I think I look very sharp.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.440]   I'm not wearing it now.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.760]   I should have worn it for today,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.280]   but I wanted to surprise everybody.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   Inducino.com, don't forget the offer code TWIT.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:04.400]   I was really surprised when the news across the wire yesterday
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.480]   that the US Supreme Court halted
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.400]   that horrific Texas social media law.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.280]   Instead of just one justice,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.040]   it would have been,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.240]   it could have been shadow-dockoted,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.400]   and I think it would have been Justice Alito
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.600]   that could have said,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.320]   "No, we're not gonna review this."
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   So just to refresh your memory, Texas legislature.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.920]   Yes.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.640]   Oh, it's a horrible bill.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.100]   Texas legislature approved this.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.360]   A court blocked it.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.240]   Then of course the Texas attorney general appealed,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   and the Fifth District Court unblocked the block.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.400]   Now, if you wanna know more about why this social media law
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.280]   is so bad, you gotta just read Mike Masnick on Tech Dirt.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.240]   In fact, let me pull up some of his articles on this.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.400]   - It was always so brilliant.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.240]   - Yeah.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.280]   It's one of those laws that essentially,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.960]   well, here's his headline,
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   just how incredibly effed up
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.040]   is Texas social media content moderation law.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040]   He points out--
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.880]   - Can I tell ya?
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.200]   - Let me tell ya.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.800]   He points out, for instance,
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.200]   remember in Buffalo, a couple of shootings ago,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   it's hard to keep track, I know,
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.720]   but the guy who did this was streaming it on Twitch,
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.440]   Masnick says, "Twitch could have been sued
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.160]   "for taking the stream down."
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.240]   It opens a social network
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.840]   with more than 50 million average US users
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   to lawsuits by anybody for any kind of moderation.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   Litigator Ken White did a great thread on Twitter,
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.700]   which we commented on a week ago, I think, or two weeks ago.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.280]   And I think we've probably gone through this.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.240]   It was, in fact, in effect until yesterday
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.560]   when the US Supreme Court actually reversed the decision
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.080]   of the Fifth Circuit, Jeff, were you surprised?
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.360]   I was surprised, I did not expect that.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.440]   - Yeah, I thought it was gonna be Alito, just saying,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.920]   "Yeah, well, let it be," but the decision itself,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.720]   and who voted which way--
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.120]   - That was a real surprise.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.480]   - Yeah. - I still can't figure out.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.320]   - I don't understand.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.720]   - Just to be clear, there is a trial going on.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.680]   This was a preliminary injunction by a lower court saying,
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.560]   "No, no, no, no."
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.600]   Until this has resolved, this law is not enforceable.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.120]   The Fifth District said, "Oh, yes, it is, it's enforceable."
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.640]   The Supreme Court has merely said, "No, no, no, no,
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.000]   "enforcement of this law until the case
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.440]   "works its way through the courts."
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.840]   So the law is not gone.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.840]   Right now what's happening is there will be a court case
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.240]   and that will be decided.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.720]   You know what, at that point it may go back
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.840]   to the Supreme Court.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.760]   So it's kind of unclear exactly, you know,
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.440]   Google said the measure would unconstitutionally bar platforms
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.280]   from removing neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan crap
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.700]   or Russian propaganda about Ukraine.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.480]   - Was this measure brought up just because they felt
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.320]   the tech companies are--
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.560]   - Yes, screwing with freedom of speech.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.400]   - Yeah, and you remember the Florida law
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   that initially exempted Disney?
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.760]   - Oh, right, okay.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.960]   - And then after Disney, after Governor Desantis decided
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.800]   Disney was a woke corporation,
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.760]   yeah, we're gonna include Disney on this one,
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.920]   which just shows this is a pure politics.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.440]   Both of them really were Republican legislators
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.600]   saying to, in effect to Twitter,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.720]   you should never have banned Donald Trump,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.320]   now see what happens.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.760]   So it was really about conservative legislators saying,
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.800]   big tech, particularly Facebook and Twitter,
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.080]   and actually Facebook, I think, I don't know,
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.600]   I think Facebook may or may not be,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.960]   it's not liable in Florida now
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   'cause its net worth has gone down,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.000]   but I think it's still liable in Texas.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.360]   These guys are left leaning and they have to be
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.660]   held accountable for their moderation decisions,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.480]   but what it really does is opens up
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.080]   all moderation decisions to suit.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.960]   So the US Supreme Court, it was close, it was 5-4,
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.320]   said no, no, we're gonna block this law
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.620]   until it works its way through the courts.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.520]   - And Ari Cohen, I put it in a thread,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.200]   Ari Cohen says that there's also thinking
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.800]   that the status of the Florida law
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.920]   does also have impact here, so it's both together.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.240]   And it also means the court is gonna take this up.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.560]   - It's ultimately, they will have to.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.360]   - It's gonna treat it seriously.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.600]   - Yeah, ultimately, I think this is in a way saying,
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.720]   yeah, just hold on, we're gonna rule on this,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.600]   but in the meanwhile, 'cause it's clearly,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.920]   at least in my opinion, and I'm not a lawyer,
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.520]   but Kathy Gellis, who has felt this way too,
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.840]   it's unconstitutional, it's a government telling
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.840]   a private business. - Who knows what
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   constitution is?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.080]   - Well, I know.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.560]   So the dissent, the people who said,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.880]   no, no, this law should stand, were Neil Gorsuch,
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.200]   Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, the very reliable.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.480]   - So far, not surprising.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.800]   - Right wing judges, and Elena Kagan.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.960]   And Elena Kagan. - The worst was procedural
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.560]   in a way that I don't understand.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.440]   - I haven't seen this. - We don't know,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.160]   because there was no written dissent.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   So we don't know those things. - Yeah, I think
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.640]   we were trying to speculate why it would be
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   based on her prior, and I still don't understand it.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.160]   - Well, the government does order private businesses
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.120]   to serve citizens under like ADA and things like that.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.400]   Maybe there's something like that.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   I'm really stretching, I don't know.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.560]   - It's just unknown.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.280]   Let me look at Ari's thread here.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.080]   - It's complicated.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.000]   - Oh, they did a spaces, so.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.880]   Cision comes on the Hill of the 11th Circuit's ruling
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.520]   of Florida's law also violates the First Amendment.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.240]   Yeah, I don't know, do they consider?
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.840]   And by the way, that has not been appealed
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.600]   to the Supreme Court yet, and that's Clarence Thomas,
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.760]   who will decide that one.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.960]   The votes to grant the applications to vacate
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.120]   the Fifth Circuit's decision
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.960]   along enforcement of the law in favor were Justice Roberts.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.680]   Okay, buyer, buyer, rather, you'd expect that.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.920]   Sotomayor, you'd expect that.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.640]   Roberts is kind of a swing, but so that's two liberals,
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.440]   the Chief Justice, and Kavanaugh and Barrett,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.760]   the two newest Supreme Court justices.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.480]   - The Trumpiest of them all, yeah.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.200]   There wasn't a Lido to send.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.320]   I should say there wasn't a sent by a Lido,
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.880]   but Kagan did not join that dissent,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.040]   so she never talked about her reasons.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   - And the sentence says here at number four
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.360]   was ostensibly procedural.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.520]   They argue that the plaintiff says
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.040]   Ari haven't demonstrated a substantial likelihood
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.680]   of success on the merits because it's quite unclear
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   where their existing law supports their challenge.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.920]   So it's a hall of mirrors here.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   The double, triple, quadruple negatives.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.160]   It's hard to figure out.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:17.400]   - Okay, yeah, well.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.680]   - So I think you're right.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.920]   I think, I mean, I'm not really equipped.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.520]   If Kathy were here, maybe she would be
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.040]   to go through this thread.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.080]   But I think the issue is end up going
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.640]   to end up in the Supreme Court again.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.680]   It's just got to work its way there
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.080]   once the courts in Florida and Texas--
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.680]   - Well, what's scary about the courts is the fact
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.360]   that this didn't get shot down once and for all
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.000]   at the first level of court to say this is patently
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.080]   ridiculously unconstitutional.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.520]   - And the fact that it got through the Fifth Circuit,
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.040]   but see, they were just really on the injunction.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.480]   So we haven't yet heard a court rule on the law itself,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   actually, just the injunction.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.800]   - No, we haven't.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.880]   - We'll see.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.920]   Anyway, kind of a surprise from the Supreme Court.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.880]   You just never know what those nine folks--
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.120]   - Those wacky, wacky folks.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.680]   - Black robes are gonna do.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.240]   - Yeah. - Just never know.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.720]   - I love this moment when Leo's looking down the list
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.280]   thinking, "Ahh."
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.120]   - What the fuck is that?
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.000]   - What's gonna be--
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.600]   - Well, let me ask you all.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.400]   So we've had court decisions around, like,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.880]   is it fair for like the president to block people?
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.280]   So a politician, is he okay for that person to block people
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.840]   on like Twitter or other social media sites?
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.560]   - He's efficient.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.480]   - With something like this.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.560]   - Well, remember they ruled that President Trump
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.080]   could not block people on Twitter
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:47.760]   because he was on his feet as potists.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.840]   - Yeah, as Donald Trump he could.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.040]   - Yeah, as potists he couldn't because--
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.880]   - Okay.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.840]   - You're supposed to listen to the--
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.320]   - You're using a governmental instrument.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   - Crazy thought. - Crazy thought.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.480]   - But you're supposed to see--
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   - Oh, that is small detail.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   - Yeah.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.600]   - That would be like blocking your phone number
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.640]   from calling the White House.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.480]   - Yes.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.320]   - That's a better way to do that, yes.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.680]   We don't wanna hear from that anymore.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.360]   - Okay, but for a long time though,
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   and I know that we now have separate accounts
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.400]   for certain elected officials,
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.640]   but, you know, well, I guess we're just figuring out.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.880]   Never mind.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.720]   - Yeah.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.600]   - Big, I think very interesting,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.080]   letter from some of the most renowned
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.840]   and respected technologists in the world,
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.680]   including Bruce Schneier,
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.600]   who we've had on this show's very top level security guy.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.920]   Miguel de Acaza, who was at Microsoft,
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.520]   he very well known a programmer.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.360]   Principal engineer at Google,
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.120]   Cloud Kelsey Hightower,
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   saying, watch your wallet, blockchain
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.600]   and the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.200]   should be regulated.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.080]   Should be regulated.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.440]   - Danger danger this.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.920]   - Danger danger.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.400]   The Schneier says the claims
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.000]   that the blockchain advocates make are not true.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.560]   It's not secure.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.320]   It's not decentralized.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.480]   Any system where you forget your password
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.640]   and you lose your life savings is not a safe system.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.840]   - Yeah, that's decentralization, right?
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.080]   - The crypto industry is not decentralized.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.240]   - So what they're essentially writing is a counter
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.120]   to the lobby crypto industry lobby,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.520]   which spends millions of dollars
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.400]   getting Congress to support the crypto industry.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.760]   They're saying, well, we wanna provide a counter argument.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.640]   We're counter lobbying.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.400]   I'm sorry, you said that decentralization
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.840]   and well, I was saying,
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.160]   if you lose your password
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.480]   because there's nobody else keeping track
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.320]   of your passwords allowing you to get them managed.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.800]   - Well, that's right, that's problematic.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.000]   - Forgot a password.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.720]   That's part of it being decentralized, right?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.000]   Isn't that what you sign up for?
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.760]   - Well, Schneier says it's not decentralized.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.080]   And I think that might be referring more to NFTs,
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.400]   which are in theory decentralized,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.240]   but in fact, open C.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.640]   - But that's all under open C.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.760]   - In fact, we already saw that
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.320]   because when Open C decided to block an NFT
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.120]   to take it off the--
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.040]   - But Open C just last week said
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.120]   that they were gonna shift to a protocol
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.560]   like blue sky shifts social to protocol.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.240]   So there is that movement to go the other way,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.080]   but you're right, Ant.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.640]   If it's totally decentralized,
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.200]   there's kind of no appeal to control it as a result.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.000]   So yeah, this is kind of both sides of the coin here.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.360]   It is decentralized.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.020]   Ergo, it's hard to protect people.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.840]   It's not decentralized in the sense
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.120]   that Open C can still be a single point of failure
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.880]   for at least NFTs.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.800]   - The letter goes on to say,
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.440]   crypto assets have been the vehicle for unsound
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.920]   and highly volatile speculative investment schemes
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.760]   that are being actively promoted to retail investors
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.720]   who may be unable to understand their nature and risk.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.520]   I've been saying this for a long time.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.840]   And further, they go on to say,
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.680]   crypto and blockchain tech serve no real purpose.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.120]   Now I have, and I think Stacey,
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.240]   you have been in a number, I know Ant, you have,
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.520]   we've been saying, well, maybe the underlying technology
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.960]   like blockchain has some value.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.680]   They don't even acknowledge that.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.940]   Miguel de Casa said, "The computational power,
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.280]   equivalent to what you would do in a centralized way,
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.440]   through a bank with a $100 computer,
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.600]   we're essentially wasting millions of dollars
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.040]   worth of equipment because we've decided
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.800]   we don't trust the banking system."
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.000]   - Oh, well, that's, again,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.640]   that's only for financial stuff.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.680]   So I would take that with the green of some.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.120]   - Right, good point.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.960]   Although these guys, you know, Shania for sure.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.800]   By the way, Tim Bray, who is also one of the signers,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   this is the letter is at concerned.tech.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.560]   And it's to Schumer, McConnell, Pelosi, McCarthy,
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.600]   all the leadership in Congress,
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.880]   was also signed by Tim Bray,
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.000]   who will be on Tech News Weekly tomorrow.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.440]   Good get, Micah Sargent, good guy to get, Tim Zing.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.720]   Tim's a great guy.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.560]   Corey Doctorow signed it.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.920]   You know, I would have signed it.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.760]   I kind of agree.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.960]   I think there's a--
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.680]   - He's caution in financial evidence.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.480]   - Molly White, the famous, now famous creator
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.360]   of Web3 is going great on that website.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.080]   Jamie Wiesowinsky, who was a developer at Netscape,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.840]   very well known in the business--
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.120]   - Molly White signed the letter too.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.240]   Oh, I want to say that. - Yeah, Molly White, yeah.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:36.800]   And you can sign it too, if you want, at concerned.tech.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.200]   I think they really just want to counter
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.760]   a lot of lobbying from companies
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.200]   that stand to gain a lot of money.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.440]   - As Stacey would say, if I may, Stacey,
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.080]   this is something we have to discuss.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.480]   We can't just rush into it.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.560]   And I'm all for, let's try out the internet
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.400]   and see what it is.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.840]   But when it comes to people's life savings,
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.800]   you gotta be a little more deliberate.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.520]   - Well, in part of it is, I mean,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.800]   we're a nation of people, I mean,
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   especially in the US of get rich, quick schemers.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.160]   I mean, good lord. - Yep, yep.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.480]   So I feel like some of this feels so
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.320]   uniquely American and weird because of that.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.560]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.320]   She's like, I'm gonna put my money in crypto.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.920]   That's just psychotic.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.560]   But it's not psychotic if, you know, six months ago,
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.080]   you said it and you were walking away with, you know,
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.160]   an extra $40,000 on $40.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.280]   So I sort of get it, but I'm also like, no.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.880]   He says blockchain solutions are often,
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.440]   I'm talking about Bruce Schneider here.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   This is a wired opinion piece he wrote in 2019.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.640]   There's no good reason to trust blockchain technology.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.440]   He said, blockchain solutions are often much worse
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.200]   than they what they replace.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   He says, if, you know, the interesting kinds of blockchains
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.920]   include, you know, currency, a digital token,
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.880]   he says there are private blockchains,
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.840]   but they're completely uninteresting.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:11.800]   They're just, he said, they're not anything new.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.200]   They're distributed to depend only data structures
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.000]   with a list of individuals authorized to add to it.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.680]   Consensus protocols have been studied
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.200]   and distributed systems for more than 60 years.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.480]   You know, he says, the only reason to operate
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.840]   when it's to ride on the blockchain hype.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:31.040]   But the public blockchain, he says,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.520]   is it actually good for anything?
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.160]   Well, it's all a matter of trust.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.320]   There have been efforts to say the journals
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.480]   which should be there because it can't be erased then,
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.440]   but that's the other issue.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.400]   That's part of Anne's point about being distributed.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.960]   It's distributed in a way that there's stuff
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.040]   you might want to take down and you can't then
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.200]   because it's too distributed.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   Well, you remember--
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.760]   Again, I think that's just knowing the trade-offs.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.680]   I mean, I feel like as human beings who talk about this,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   we do a terrible job in politics,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.640]   in media of explaining these things.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.960]   Like, this is good for this thing,
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.520]   but it's not good for everything.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.360]   Right.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.920]   He says what blockchain does is shift trust in people
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.120]   in institutions and banks to technology.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.440]   You need to trust the crypto,
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.280]   the protocols, the software, the computers, the network.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.240]   And you need to trust them absolutely
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.000]   because they're often single points of failure.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.120]   We've seen this lately in a lot of ways.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.960]   When that trust turns out to be misplaced
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.040]   and there is no recourse.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   If your Bitcoin exchange gets hacked,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   you lose all your money.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.120]   If your Bitcoin wallet gets hacked, you lose all your money.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.520]   If you forget your login credentials,
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.560]   you lose all your money.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.600]   If somebody steals your--
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.520]   But if somebody else wants to Verizon
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.080]   and say that I am little a port,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.120]   can you please send me a text and verify you have--
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:48.960]   Well, that's right.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.800]   You have to--
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.480]   But he does point out, and I think this is true,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.960]   that these systems, these other non-blockchain systems,
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.200]   there's been a lot of work to make them secure.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.920]   There's laws and regulations.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.320]   There's backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.920]   There's anti-counterfeiting technologies.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.760]   There's internet security technologies.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.080]   So--
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.360]   And the institutions have a reputation to maintain.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.080]   So I think he makes a--
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.920]   There is no reputation to be maintained
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   if the protection of the blockchain fails,
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.120]   which it keeps doing time and time again, and you've got to
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.560]   acknowledge that.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.080]   There's no--
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.040]   Of course.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.880]   Look at Seth Green.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.240]   Yep.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:31.880]   Bye bye.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.240]   Poor Nate.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:32.600]   Poor Nate.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.320]   Seth, right.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:33.600]   Yep.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.200]   Bye bye.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:34.720]   Right.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.360]   Right.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:36.760]   So--
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.280]   But centralization too has problems.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.800]   Centralization means you're in the control of one Elon Musk
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.440]   or one Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.560]   Centralization means you can become controlled
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.480]   by the Chinese government.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.680]   There's no ideal here.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.000]   Jack Dorsey tweeted a few weeks ago
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.800]   right before the announcement of the Musk efforts
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.960]   that centralized identity was a mistake,
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.240]   and he felt responsible for it.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.200]   And that's the last I think blue sky.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.680]   And so we got to find middle grounds.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.160]   And I think Stacy's exactly right.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.320]   It depends on the use.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:10.960]   What is good for--
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.320]   I still stand--
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.240]   What is good for the other?
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.160]   I still stand by NFTs being cool for artists
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.640]   to be able to get paid.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.720]   I just think if you want to get paid--
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.640]   Some sell something.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.080]   That's what--
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.480]   Ask somebody to donate your money.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.160]   I don't know--
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   Patreon the NFT.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.280]   I don't know what the NFT is.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   Right.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.920]   You don't need the NFT.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.360]   But what I'm saying is it's nice knowing
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.400]   that there is another option out there
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.000]   beyond the world of PayPal, beyond the world of, hey,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.280]   buy prints from antproot.com/prints.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.200]   But unfortunately, there are scammers out there
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.640]   that sort of screwed all of that up.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.160]   And there's people out there that's
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.440]   making these eight bit pieces of art in Selma
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.640]   for a gazillion dollars for whatever reason
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.920]   that I've never really agreed with.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.000]   But then there's the other end of the spectrum
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.800]   of someone like Elise Swopes, who's
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.760]   made some just beautiful art using her phone.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.680]   And she's made a nice chunk of Changjoff of it.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.400]   And she continues to just do it and get paid and not really
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.640]   be all scammy about it.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.680]   I would submit that if somebody donates to you
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.120]   through an NFT, that their chief interest is not your art.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.080]   Their chief interest is--
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.760]   Yeah, they're just trying to--
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.120]   Especially on your art.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.560]   And if they really loved your art,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.200]   they would buy your art, or they would donate to you
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.720]   with a Patreon or something like that, and you could do fine.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.960]   If they only way you're selling your art is through an NFT,
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.200]   then that's because people think it's going to be valuable.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.760]   I mean, it's true of fine art as well.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.720]   That's how--
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.560]   Yeah, I mean, that's how the artwork is--
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.760]   Got famous and rich and died.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.720]   But anyway, I think that--
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.360]   I think it's a important discussion.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.200]   Honestly, these are people I respect to the NST degree
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.480]   confirming my bias, which I've--
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.280]   You know, it's changed.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.000]   My views on this have changed as I've watched this kind of fall
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.880]   apart.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.520]   But let's even say Bitcoin, though.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.080]   I mean, if you're in the United States
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.840]   and you've got family back in Columbia,
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.320]   if you had to go through Western Union,
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.360]   you lost a huge amount of money for that.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.960]   You could now transfer money from dollars to Bitcoin
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.840]   to pesos for next to nothing.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.640]   Not at all.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.920]   They're all other uses.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.280]   All those things are other uses.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:17.800]   Not at all.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   It costs you far more than Western Union.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.000]   It does.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   The gas fees are less than--
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.320]   No, that's right.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:22.840]   It does now.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:23.560]   It didn't in the beginning.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.480]   But now.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.840]   And it's much slower.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.280]   It's unpredictably slow, unless you pay a lot of money
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.360]   for the gas fees.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.120]   And finally, the risk of getting ripped off is very--
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.280]   Exhale, yes.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.120]   --the risk of it being volatile while you're doing that,
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.080]   even is bad.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:38.960]   All I'm saying is--
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.520]   Well, and you also look at--
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.920]   Go on.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.160]   Just alternate-- it is worth exploring alternatives
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.040]   to the present fiat currency system.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.280]   I'm not against that.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.320]   I'm just not saying that blockchain gravy makes
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.960]   all meatloaf tastes good.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.440]   Sorry, Stacy.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:53.880]   Right.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.080]   And I would say that there are any time
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.000]   you explore alternatives to the current status quo,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.480]   be it blockchain, be it some magical sticker-based economy
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.360]   that a bunch of seven-year-olds come up with.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.960]   If it catches on the powers that be,
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.760]   we'll seek to capitalize on it for their own benefit.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.560]   And because they have attention, they have money,
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   they have lobbying power, they will be able to do it.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.520]   And I mean, I've never bought into this,
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.200]   like, decentralization equals automatic good
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.040]   and automatic to the power to the people.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.000]   And I think a lot of people did.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.400]   And they looked at it uncritically for things.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.480]   And that's why I appreciate this letter.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.720]   So I don't know.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.920]   The only thing I think you watch it is good for us,
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.400]   automated contracts for, like, machine to machine,
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.920]   but that's just me.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.720]   Yeah, there's uses of it.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.080]   It's a clever technology, but it doesn't bring
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.960]   a determinism either way, unless you're Madison Caulthorn.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.520]   Oh, I don't want to do that story.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.000]   So somebody in the chat room is pointing out
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.040]   that lightning is a free way to do Bitcoin.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:10.640]   And that's true.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.040]   There is a lightning network and CashApp is using it.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.640]   But that's called re-centralizing.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.160]   Right.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:20.880]   And that's the problem.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.160]   You've got to make it easy for people.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.760]   That's not now decentralized.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.040]   That's one of the trade-offs.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.880]   Right.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.440]   Suddenly you are reliant on a third party.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.720]   So I think when Corey Doctorow was on,
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.400]   we were talking about the idea of putting a car repair
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.640]   information on a blockchain so that when you bought a car,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.040]   you would know exactly what it had been through.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.480]   And he said, how is that any better than the system we have?
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.760]   It requires whoever does the repairs to do it.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.680]   If they don't, it's still not there.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.840]   It's not an improvement.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.240]   It's just this fairy dust that we're
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.280]   waving on stuff to get people to go, oh, that's new and cool
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.840]   and neat.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   That must be better.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.680]   It's not.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.600]   It's just not.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.760]   And it's causing a lot of people to lose a lot of money.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.560]   And by the way, this has nothing to do with my Bitcoin
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.280]   wallet.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.760]   I'm completely happy with my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.400]   It's fine.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.960]   We know you don't care about that thing.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.000]   I don't.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.800]   And honestly, if I had unlocked it,
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.720]   it would have been sold long ago.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.280]   I'm just going to hold on to it.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.360]   Maybe if Bitcoin ever goes back to more,
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.960]   because I know I can unlock it.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.880]   It's just a matter of sitting down and doing it.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.760]   It's not as good as you would be.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.560]   I have not been--
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.280]   Are you sure?
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.360]   Yes.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.120]   Absolutely.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.120]   I have not been ripped off in any way.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.400]   Leo, do you object?
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:44.760]   Fine.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.840]   So cyber currency, danger danger will Robinson.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.520]   Do you think that to Stacy's point,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.800]   that blockchain has good uses?
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.640]   I think that remains to be seen.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.920]   Bruce Schneider doesn't.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.200]   And I think he's a lot smarter than I am.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.400]   Yeah, but he has blinders just like everybody else.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   I mean, there are things I think are a great idea or things
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.760]   I think are terrible that still come to pass.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.560]   But I'm like, oh, that didn't work out as badly as I thought it might.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:12.840]   But yeah.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.160]   You don't have a security risk that currency has.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.560]   Oh, see.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.800]   Well, currency has a security risk, too, in the sense that--
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.640]   Yeah, if somebody's a few--
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.560]   If you go to the ATM and pull out $1,000 and give it to somebody,
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.720]   it's gone.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   There's no recourse.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.160]   The bank will give it back to you.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.720]   There's no recourse.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.000]   It's gone, so.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.600]   Or you just drop it on the ground and someone finds it.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   Right.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.840]   All right.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.600]   Yeah, I don't want to do the--
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.040]   That's fine.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.160]   Well, just the fact that he's--
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.120]   Of course he is, so is everybody.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.120]   They're all scammers, right?
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.080]   They're all scammers.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.920]   Let's talk about--
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.320]   That's awesome.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.120]   You did actually a tweet about this this morning,
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   which I thought was good.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.720]   Let's talk about Star Wars.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.240]   Obi-Wan.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.280]   Oh.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.120]   Oh, that was yesterday.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.720]   Your Twitter's out of whack.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.120]   I choose not to follow the latest tweets, but the best tweets.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.640]   I see.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.920]   You are the cream rising to the top there.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.080]   You have risen to the top.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   Thank you.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.400]   So what is the controversy?
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.640]   It's this casting.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.360]   What are they called?
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.960]   Rachaely blind casting.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.880]   Moses Ingram.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:39.440]   She's a key actor in this new series, Kenobi.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.440]   She's a-- what did they call it?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.280]   Jedi Hunter, essentially.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.320]   And she's a black woman.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.360]   And--
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.400]   Oh, she played Jolie in the Queen's Gambit.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.760]   Oh, there you go.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.720]   Oh, she was in Queen's Gambit.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.840]   She was the black best friend from the orphanage
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.880]   who everybody loved.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.320]   Oh, I loved her in that.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.200]   I totally forgot about that.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.640]   Oh, I loved her, too.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.560]   I was looking at her face and I'm like, that woman is familiar.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.480]   So she's been getting a lot of backlash.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.160]   People sliding into her DMs, Star Wars fans, quote,
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.040]   Star Wars fans, and just attacking her
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.080]   and basically telling her how horrible she's
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.960]   been for that role.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.600]   And she's shouldn't have been there in no talent.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.240]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and racist this and racist.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.600]   It was more about her being a black person in a role
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.480]   that they thought should be white.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.880]   Should have been somebody else, a white person.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.720]   You know, so one of my friends, you know,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.400]   she brought it up.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   She says, you know what?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.240]   It's the typical equation of she's a woman
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.360]   and she's a black woman.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.160]   And she's already got those chips stacked up against her.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:47.800]   Yep.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.840]   But it's unfortunate, but she's killing this role.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.440]   I mean, she's absolutely crushing this role.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.760]   But Star Wars has then come back and said, you know what?
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.400]   We are behind her.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.440]   And if you want to be a racist, you know, don't be a racist.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.600]   We got 20 million different species out there,
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.440]   something along those lines in those tweets.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.280]   And I appreciate the fact that they stood up for her
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.080]   and publicly made a statement about, hey, we back her up
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.640]   and you and McGregor, he went online and did a video as well
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.240]   and said, hey, I got her back too.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.760]   So screwed the rest of you racist folks.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.000]   Star Wars tweeted, there are more than 20 million sentient
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.120]   species in the Star Wars galaxy.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.800]   Don't choose to be a racist.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.560]   I think that's fair.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.400]   That's fair.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.760]   Well, it's unique because after--
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.720]   what was the movie with--
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.840]   it's the only Star Wars movie I really thought was awesome.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.480]   The one with Kelly Tran and John Boyega.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.760]   Oh, that was good.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.280]   It was real.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.200]   You're going to get in trouble here, Stacey.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:47.760]   I know.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760]   I know.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   I can't.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   Bye.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.840]   But--
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.280]   Stacey.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:52.680]   Go to Stacey.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.200]   Hot ass.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.440]   Stacey.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.920]   They did not-- Disney did not--
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.760]   I mean, John Boyega, is that how
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.280]   to say his name?
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.800]   I don't know.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.600]   He actually said that he felt like Disney didn't stand up
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.640]   for him against all this.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.200]   So apparently Disney's like, oh, well,
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.320]   we can't do this a third time.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:09.560]   I mean--
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.080]   Right.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.560]   Right.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.280]   And you know what?
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.960]   That other Star Wars was amazing.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.840]   And then they did the third episode of it.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.800]   And they were like, yeah, we're going to take all that goodness
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.640]   we threw out away because everybody complained
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.840]   so much those old Star Wars--
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.320]   Where is Kelly Tran's gone?
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.240]   They haven't done any more with her?
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:32.760]   Or him?
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.240]   She died.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.520]   I can't remember Disney.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.560]   Yeah, maybe she dies there.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.400]   I don't know.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   Good question.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.360]   I don't watch Star Wars that, it's
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.480]   technically.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.520]   Intently.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.000]   Anyway.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.600]   Well, good for them for standing up for her.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.040]   That was part of mine.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:48.040]   I know.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.760]   I need to step away from online.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.480]   I kind of got that feeling when I saw you.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.120]   All right, I'm out.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.040]   Well, you like this.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.800]   #SwedenGate trending on Twitter right now.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.080]   It turns out, Swedish people as a rule
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.280]   don't serve food to guests.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.200]   I asked a friend about this, and she told me
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.360]   that was totally true.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.760]   And I just was like--
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.600]   I just--
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.360]   Are you serious?
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.800]   I'm trying to imagine the situation.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.520]   Well, and apparently, some households in Sweden,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.720]   I think it's mostly kids.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.000]   I guess they'd be playing over at their friend's house
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.640]   and the family would eat dinner.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.480]   But they wouldn't invite the friend.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.960]   The friend would stay up in the playroom or somebody's room.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   Oh, that's just rude.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.080]   And they would eat and send it back.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.280]   Well, I asked my friend about this,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.040]   and she grew up in Sweden.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.200]   She's like, yeah, if you spent the night at someone's house,
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.480]   even in the morning for breakfast,
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.320]   your friend would go down and have eggs or cereal or something.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.680]   You would just be up in their room.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.000]   And I'm like, did you pack your own snack?
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.560]   I mean, like--
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:03.520]   This is an article independent by Linda Johansson.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.800]   She says, as a child growing up in Gottenburg,
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.880]   I remember not really caring at all that I wasn't being fed.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.800]   I just kept playing and had a nice quiet time
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.600]   while the other family had their dinner.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.040]   It's because they didn't want to mess up my family's plans.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.360]   They figured, well, your family probably
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.120]   going to feed you dinner.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   So he did with us.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.360]   It's just cultural.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.200]   It's just cultural.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:25.880]   I got to tell you.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   You get the math.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.600]   No, that's just weird.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.040]   Is that how they do it in the South Caccollections?
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.920]   I've been in similar situations in my little black communities
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:49.020]   in South Caccol
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.160]   and I don't know what your mom or your grandma's doing.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.800]   That's fair.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.960]   Because we know your parents are going to feed you.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.080]   So go home.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.720]   Or did you turn that to your mother?
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.040]   Call your mother or call your grandmother.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.720]   I see if it's--
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.240]   Right.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:03.880]   --that you eat.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.560]   Oh, there you go.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.120]   I like that.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.920]   Well, yeah, we had--
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.880]   Yeah, that I got to.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.720]   --that.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.760]   But you'd invite you.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.280]   You'd be like, you come down and you'd be like,
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.160]   hey, mom, can so-and-so stay for dinner?
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.600]   And she'd be like, sure.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.960]   Or, no, we don't have enough.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.640]   I mean, that was a totally legit thing to do.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.240]   But then you go up and you're like, all right,
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.960]   you got to go home for dinner.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.840]   We didn't leave them sitting upstairs.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.520]   That's pretty funny.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.560]   So I put the mask there.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.440]   You left me sitting outside at time or two
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.640]   with the baseball or the basketball.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.360]   Yeah, I could actually remember that.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.840]   I ain't even growing up in Sweden.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.640]   All right, where's the map?
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.040]   What line?
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.400]   So the bottom of the bottom of the rundown
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.360]   is somebody did a map about this as to what usually happens.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:41.720]   Oh.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.360]   So all of Scandinavia and clean Denmark and Iceland
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.840]   is no food for you.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.400]   Get your old lootfisk.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:48.960]   What?
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.200]   Somebody said on Twitter.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.760]   What?
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.720]   So--
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.160]   Where as?
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.280]   So the red ones are very unlikely to give you food.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.400]   Sweden's in there.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.840]   The pink ones are unlikely to give you food.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.160]   The blue ones are usually--
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   That's part of the important thing.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.400]   But notice it's the southern Europe
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.520]   where they're almost always.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.960]   You know, in Italy, in Spain, they're going to make you.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.400]   You're going to make you.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.160]   I don't care if you've got dinner waiting for you.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   You're eating now.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.720]   So I really have more to do with climate.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.040]   I don't know.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:24.560]   I don't know.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   It's culture.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.720]   It's culture.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.600]   I guess.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.840]   I just-- I can't imagine eating in front of someone
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.160]   and not offering them food.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.720]   That is just--
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.720]   Shoot.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.080]   I can't even but I'm selfish.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.080]   So I'm telling you, the warmer the climate,
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.240]   the more likely you'll be fed.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.160]   So in Texas, you're going to be fed.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.720]   In Canada, I'm not so sure.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.160]   What is it?
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   Canadians.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.160]   We have a lot of Canadians.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.400]   Canadians in the chat room.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.680]   Canadians in club to it.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.640]   What happens when you were a kid, then you went over and you
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.480]   visited?
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.280]   Would you get food?
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.920]   Would you get fed?
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.920]   It's probably a kindly worded debate.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920]   That's what food never happened.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.520]   So sorry, but we can't feed you.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.400]   So Wally Syer explains on Twitter.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   It's a link at the bottom of that story.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.640]   That in Norse culture, hospitality,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.480]   providing food, drink, lodging, was a duty of higher status
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.440]   individuals toward people of lower status.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.400]   So the act of receiving hospitality
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.600]   created an obligation or debt on the part of the recipient
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.400]   who couldn't afford it.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.840]   That's my parenthetical.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.640]   So hospitality not only brought honor to the giver,
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.440]   it had the potential to bring shame to the recipient.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.400]   Norse culture in the middle ages was incredibly, personally
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.120]   violent.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.680]   There's that too.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.920]   You took my lootfish and didn't give me any pop off
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.040]   of your head.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.480]   So people fought duels, violently extracted debts,
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.600]   and squeezed renters all this from Wally Syerk on Twitter.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.240]   One of the challenges the Protestant Church in Scandinavia
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.360]   post 30 years war was to create a culture that
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.240]   tapped down on personal violence.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.000]   Because as somebody said to me some time ago,
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.280]   I read something that said, you know,
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.040]   Sweden ransacked all of Europe.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.880]   And today they're Sweden.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.040]   So people change.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.640]   So they tried to change the culture.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.360]   But the root of a lot of in-personal violence
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.120]   was a competition for status and an abstraction of payment.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.240]   That's really interesting, isn't it?
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.960]   So in a way it would be implying that I am higher status
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   than you to invite you to eat.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.280]   I give you food.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.360]   Well, that's true.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.240]   You probably too portly.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.520]   When I was growing up, I would have friends who, like,
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.240]   my parents tracked who I ate, you know,
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.040]   because like as a kid you don't necessarily know.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.280]   But they had a definite reciprocity thing that--
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.120]   Oh, somebody.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.160]   Oh, they're friends of mine.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.640]   So that's interesting.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.040]   But like my friends who, like, I had a friend who
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.520]   was Filipino and God help us, we could not go to that house
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.320]   without like there was food always.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:01.840]   Right.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.400]   Time is climate.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:08.200]   So this is another great tweet here from him.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.760]   The church with the framing of early Protestant humanists
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.680]   began to promote the ideal of the free member of society,
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.440]   "Oh, we know one and owed nothing."
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.800]   If the culture could get rid of the interactions that caused
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.080]   friction, comma, people could live more peaceful lives.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.680]   So you're proud and you owe--
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.880]   we're going to just--
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.680]   you go have your dinner at your place because--
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.880]   I don't-- you know, it's just-- it's cultural.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.760]   It's fine.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.560]   It is cultural.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.360]   Now, meanwhile, Tim Hortons--
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   Tim Hortons.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.800]   What candidate was cool?
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.040]   Well, they did get caught by Canadian Watch Dogs.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.520]   Tim Hortons app tracked people illegally,
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.920]   according to Canadian Watch Dogs.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.120]   The app would show where users lived, where they worked.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.640]   And the probe showed no legitimate reason for the tracking.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.000]   The company was told today to shut off that capability
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.440]   after an investigation by federal and provincial authorities.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:06.920]   Found that the--
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.000]   At-to, Timmy?
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:08.680]   At-to.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.880]   On the Tim Hortons app, misled many users
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.280]   to believe information would only be accessed
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.020]   when the app was in use.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.700]   Nope, as long as the device was on,
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:20.180]   the app was continually collecting location data.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.980]   The app used location data.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.840]   It generated an event every time users
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.120]   entered or left to Tim Horton's competitor.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.480]   - Whoa! - A majors.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.640]   - Whoa! - Whoa!
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:35.960]   - A majors sports event or their home or workplace.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.740]   - Timmy, Timmy, Timmy. - Timmy, Timmy.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.560]   This was first came to light two years ago
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.680]   when in a story by the Financial Post,
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.000]   it took a while for the government,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.400]   the wheels to turn, but Tim Horton's continued
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.640]   to "continues to collect vast amounts of location data
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.260]   for a year after shelving plans to use it
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:58.780]   for targeted advertising."
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:03.600]   So they weren't even gonna use it for targeted advertising.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.720]   Tim Horton's-- - Did they, oh, go on.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.120]   I was like, what did they say
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.200]   as to why they were doing this?
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.240]   - They say, oh, sorry, sorry.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.800]   We'll implement the recommendations
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.880]   in the report right away.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.280]   They included deleting any remaining location data,
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   directing third party providers to do the same,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.520]   establishing and maintaining a privacy management program
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.280]   or reporting back to the authorities with details
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.160]   on the measures it has taken to comply
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.240]   with the recommendations.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.080]   We're so sorry.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.240]   - You don't know it's for everybody.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.120]   - We're sorry.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.340]   Tim bits for all.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.080]   - You know, I was really disappointed
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.760]   when I went into Tim Horton's.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.040]   - Oh yeah, I agree.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.520]   - I thought it was gonna be this awesome experience.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.080]   It's like a dunking.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.280]   It's the worst. - It's a bad dunking bonus.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.640]   - Oh yeah, I agree.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.480]   - It's just so--
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.000]   Are you implying that Dunkin' is not great?
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.240]   - Dunkin' is horrible.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.800]   They're bad donuts, it's terrible coming.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.160]   - Oh my God, yes, I agree.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.960]   - No, I still love Dunkin' Donuts.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.360]   - You do? - But I love my Regg--
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.120]   I still love Dunkin' Donuts,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.960]   but I definitely hit up the local homemade donuts.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.800]   - We have some pretty good--
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.840]   - Shipplies are way better.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.360]   Crispy cream way better.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   Dunkin' taste great.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.760]   - Dunkin' a Santa Crispy Cream, namma southerner.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.920]   - Oh, you know what?
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.520]   Crispy cream is a Trojan horse.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.840]   'Cause crispy cream looks great, it's light, it's fluffy,
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.480]   smells great, you taste it, you eat it,
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.320]   your mouth goes, oh my God, that's great.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   And then it lands and explodes in your stomach.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.000]   It is a stealth-- - It's a tummy bob.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.520]   - Just one of them, 12 of them.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.200]   - It's a-- - You just sold the light,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.880]   you just shovel it in.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.960]   - Yeah, it was like-- - Do you agree with me?
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.040]   You feel terrible, almost instilling, right?
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:44.880]   Almost instilling.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.320]   - I feel, if you only eat one or two, it's okay.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.480]   Now I used to eat like six and then suddenly I'd be like,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.160]   "Oh man, sugar hot, what the hell?"
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.640]   (laughing)
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.600]   Then I'd be better and I'd be like,
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.480]   "Oh, I shouldn't do that."
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.600]   - I'll always remember you Stacey is the woman
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.880]   who taught me what meat sweats meant.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.080]   (laughing)
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.240]   - Please put that in my obituary.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.520]   - I watched that, that was a great moment.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.640]   - Yes.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.360]   - Well, if I get the honor of doing your eulogy,
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.040]   I will in fact tell that story, I promise.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:17.880]   - There we go.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.840]   (laughing)
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.720]   - No, there's no brisket in heaven, there's none.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.360]   All right, let me take a break.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.560]   I think timing wise is a good time to pause.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.800]   And then Jeff is gonna tell me all the TikTok stories.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.480]   - Sure.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.960]   (laughing)
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   - Including when I put together a little lobsterman.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.800]   - Wow.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.800]   - I also put together a little trio of stories
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.240]   about celebrating identity on the net, which I liked.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.680]   - That sounds good.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.960]   That's still to come.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.080]   And we can't call it fang anymore, it's mange.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.880]   (laughing)
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.280]   - It's mangeldfang.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.440]   - Mangldfang on us.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.360]   - Well, it used to be Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix,
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.640]   and Google, fang.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.520]   But Facebook is changing its stock ticker to metal.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.360]   - All right.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.280]   - So now it's mange.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.360]   - Surprise.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.240]   - I don't know.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.600]   - Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.600]   - Now that Cheryl's gone, it's all gonna hell.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.600]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.560]   If you are gonna get an IT, you're gonna quickly,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.400]   I mean, you're watching our shows,
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.000]   we know you're a techno enthusiast, you know your stuff,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.160]   you're probably the person and everybody around you
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.840]   asked for tech advice.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.600]   But if you wanna get that job in IT,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.760]   none of that's gonna matter,
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.640]   you're gonna have to get those certs,
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.320]   the certifications that tell your future employer
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.800]   you got the right stuff.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.160]   So almost invariably when somebody wants to get into IT,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.280]   they find a school to learn this stuff,
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.640]   or they buy books or whatever.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.040]   I'm just gonna tell you the best IT training platform
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.360]   is ITProTV.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.680]   It really is.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.480]   It costs less than all those expensive books.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   The training is so much better,
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.040]   it's up to date instead of sitting in a classroom,
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.760]   listening to somebody who hasn't booted a hard drive
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.840]   in years, you're actually gonna get really, really good
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.560]   trainers who are experts in the business,
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.760]   who are really good at explaining it,
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.040]   whose passion communicates,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.400]   they call them edutainers for a reason, they make it fun.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.200]   The best possible IT training,
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.840]   plus it's always up to date, ITProTV,
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.080]   has seven studios running all day Monday through Friday,
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.960]   recording new content,
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.840]   so that, and you gotta do that,
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.080]   the test change, the software changes,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.560]   there's always new material,
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.280]   that's why you get the most up to date,
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.040]   best possible IT training inserts with ITProTV.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.400]   And best of all, you could do it on your own schedule,
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.360]   you could do it in little chunks if you want,
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.720]   all the episodes are in 20 to 30 minute segments,
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.480]   they have practice exams you can take
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.480]   before you take the test, that's very helpful,
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.000]   virtual labs, you don't even have to have a Windows server,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.480]   you just use your browser,
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.600]   and set up a Windows server,
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.960]   and clients and all that in the browser.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.080]   And 5,800 hours of on-demand IT training,
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.120]   it's always up to date, always up to date.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.120]   One reviewer said,
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.720]   the most engaging hosts I've ever watched,
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.120]   I highly recommend ITProTV,
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.440]   not only the IT professionals,
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.200]   but to people who have an interest in IT,
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.520]   but don't know where to start,
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.800]   very educational and entertaining.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.200]   People like Ronnie Wong, so great, so fun.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.120]   Tim and Don, they're just great,
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.200]   Don Pazette is a fantastic, enthusiastic,
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.880]   knowledgeable guy, love Adam, they're all so good.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:49.760]   Check out some of the newest courses,
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.400]   CompT is A+ Core 1 and 2 series,
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.760]   A+ is often the first series,
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.760]   the first cert you get,
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.560]   and they have the best CompT of training.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.400]   They're A+ Core 1 and Core 2 series,
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.840]   they're designed for professionals
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.920]   who do the Core technology,
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.960]   security, networking, virtualization.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.840]   And as you probably know,
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.960]   if you've tried to get a job or you have a job in IT,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.560]   that A+ cert is an industry standard
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.840]   for launching IT careers in today's digital world.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.080]   There is no better way, more entertaining,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.440]   more accurate, more up to date,
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.200]   faster than doing an ITProTV.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.040]   You learn about hardware, operating systems,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.400]   networking, security, troubleshooting,
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.320]   and you can take the test before you take the test,
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.200]   so you'll know I got what it takes,
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.360]   or I better study some more.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.960]   Coming up June 11th and 12th,
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.760]   they're free project management weekend.

[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.720]   June 11th and 12th, free project management weekend.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   They're also two free live webinars this month

[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   all things cyber security,
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.080]   hacking your way into the field with Daniel Lowry and Zach Hill,
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.600]   two of their best trainers, I love that,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.960]   that's Thursday, June 16th, 2 p.m. Eastern,
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.720]   and speaking of project management,
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.520]   the future of project management with Chris Ward

[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.760]   Ant, did you go see Top Gun?
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.120]   I feel like you went to see it, who's--
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   I did not.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.640]   Oh, Ian Thompson saw it.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.960]   You haven't seen it yet?
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:07.160]   Stacey, I don't know, are you a Top Gun?
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.600]   No. (laughs)
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.880]   So Val Kilmer, as you know,
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.040]   who was in the original Top Gun is also in the middle.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.720]   He didn't ask me, he knew the answer.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.680]   Yeah, did you go see Top Gun?
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.080]   No.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.480]   I mean, I had COVID the whole time it was out.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.360]   Yeah, no, it just came out, but it was a huge,
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.440]   broke huge.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.440]   Val Kilmer, and Iceman, of course,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.880]   is in the new Top Gun,
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:37.600]   and it turns out in the way they handle it,
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.160]   'cause Kilmer had, I think, throat cancer,
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.320]   so he can't speak.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.520]   But he did have a line of dialogue in the sequel.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.200]   How did they do it?
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.040]   AI.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.400]   AI is bad, Mr. LaPorche.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.040]   Not this AI, this is good.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.040]   (laughs)
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.160]   It's a deep fake, it's a deep,
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.960]   we won't know what it's real now.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.520]   So Nantic is a company.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.000]   Movie's used to be real.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.480]   They used a voice engine to teach the AI voice model
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.840]   how to do an accurate impression of Val Kilmer.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.480]   The engine, unfortunately,
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.280]   did about 10 times less data
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   than it would have been given in a typical project.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.200]   That wasn't enough, so they had to come up
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.680]   with better algorithms that could produce
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.720]   a higher quality voice model,
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   because there wasn't a lot of Val Kilmer
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.560]   tell him where to train it, I guess.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.800]   It wasn't there, but there'd be tons.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.480]   He was in showbiz.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.400]   I was, I was, I think.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.920]   Well, he did.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.960]   I guess, like, think about when he was Jim Morrison
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.040]   for the doors, did he sound just like he sounded
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.400]   when he was texting him?
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.480]   Yeah, that's important.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.640]   Plus, you know, he was only Iceman, you know,
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.800]   in the one movie, you wanna hear it?
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.280]   You wanna hear the synthesized voice?
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.680]   That'd be weird for him, you know?
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.440]   You all have the capacity to be creative.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.200]   You missed it, 'cause you were talking.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.040]   All driven to share our deepest dreams
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.920]   and ideas with the world.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.440]   Well, that's pretty good.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.000]   That is really good.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.800]   When we think of the most talented creative people,
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.640]   they speak to us in a unique way.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.760]   A phrase we often hear is
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.080]   having a creative voice.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.840]   So, if you didn't, you know, if you saw that in the movie
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.200]   and you, I don't think you'd know it was synthesized.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.040]   Right.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.640]   Well, you wouldn't expect it to be.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.120]   I mean, aren't you creeped out by the fact
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.360]   that after you're dead, they could like recreate you
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.200]   and you say--
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.040]   I hope they do.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.440]   I creeped out.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.240]   Where do the royalty checks go?
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.280]   I'll buy the NFT of Leo's voice.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.440]   And missed the little port on my head.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.880]   But you could be advocating for anything.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.280]   The jerk on the back is dead, no.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.360]   Hey, yeah, there's a lot of video.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.840]   Me as a virtual character.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.320]   I'll be better looking, better looking this time.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.080]   You may remember the NFT insider training issue
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.480]   with OpenSea.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.080]   Department of Justice has charged an ex-opensea executive
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.040]   with Insider Trading.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.320]   That's the first time they've pursued Insider Trading
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.920]   with crypto.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:00.400]   Uh-oh.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.600]   They chastained the OpenSea staffer who
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.280]   quit after an Insider Trading scandal in September
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.920]   is now in the crosshairs of US authorities.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.840]   He was charged today with wire fraud and money laundering.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.760]   This-- we had the story a couple of weeks ago
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.840]   before the NFTs were offered to the public.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.120]   He was buying them up and then flipping them
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.640]   dozens of NFTs, deciding which--
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.560]   he got to decide which ones were featured on the website.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.880]   So he would make 200% to 500%.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.320]   Boom, just like that.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.080]   And of course, he hid his purchases
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.720]   using anonymous digital currency wallets
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.160]   and anonymous opensea accounts.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.440]   Not anonymous enough, apparently.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.720]   Air quote anonymous.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.280]   So--
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.280]   That's your own saying.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.120]   The right, sir.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.160]   Make sure you're not the last person holding the bag.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.160]   Just be the next to the last person.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.560]   So OpenSea said it investigated once it found out
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.960]   about his actions, asked him to resign.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.560]   His behavior was a violation of employee policies.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.000]   He's actually currently working on a new NFT project called
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.360]   Ovel.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.480]   He was arrested this morning in New York.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.920]   So maybe that's going to be on hold.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:23.560]   If you are in France, do not call it Lestrimin.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   If you're a streamer, you're not a streamer,
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.680]   and you are a streamer, you are all right.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.200]   And e-sports is your video, the competition.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.760]   Oh, it's not Lespous.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.120]   Not Lespous.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.560]   And you know, a computer is not a computer.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.640]   It is Laudinette.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.120]   Laudinette.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.520]   But now it's a computer.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:50.960]   Laudinette.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.120]   So the changes were made in consultation
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.080]   with France's Ministry of Culture.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.000]   Do they still have--
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:58.760]   Those people.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.480]   What was it called?
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.720]   There was a name for the people who were responsible
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.160]   for keeping the French language pure.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.080]   Yes, it's the language.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.120]   Oh, it's an organization.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.680]   Yeah, they have--
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.000]   it's like their literature college,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.400]   but it's basically their language process.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.840]   I don't know if they were involved in this, but--
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.040]   They had to be involved.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.560]   That's the only way it happens.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.040]   Well, they have a reasonable thing.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.400]   It's concerned that English terms could become a barrier
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.320]   to understanding for non-gamers.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.040]   Oh, Lacademy--
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:33.560]   That's not true.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.040]   --fault says.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.120]   That's what it's called.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.320]   That's what I think it is.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.800]   France's language keeper's Lacademy,
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.600]   France says, has also expressed concern
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.560]   about English jargon and gaming.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.640]   So they were the ones who proposed
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:52.000]   the alternate French terms back in 2017.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.840]   This is the language that gave us Fédougien.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.760]   Fédougien.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.040]   Yeah, and low weekend.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:58.880]   Let's T-shirts.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.920]   So I don't blame them.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:01.960]   They want to preserve--
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.760]   So for a while, they tried to stop Wi-Fi.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.760]   That's a French guy, yeah.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.160]   They tried to stop the word Wi-Fi, which, by the way,
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.360]   the French pronounce Wi-Fi, which is not Wi-Fi.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:12.760]   Which is not Wi-Fi.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.240]   I love it.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240]   I love it.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.320]   So they're done a lot.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:15.800]   Wi-Fi.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.080]   Lacademy, France says.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.080]   Wi-Fi.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.080]   They tried to get the French people to say,
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.160]   Lacéçon Fédoum, Aintelnet.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.040]   Lacçon Fédoum, Aintelnet.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.560]   But-- or Anintelnet.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.080]   I don't know.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.400]   It didn't work.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.160]   So that doesn't always work.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.280]   But in this case, you are a jouer,
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:40.080]   jouer, animator, entre, entre, entre, entre, entre.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.440]   And the jou video en vage for cloud gaming.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.400]   Noage in the cloud.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.560]   Video game in the cloud.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.400]   Jou video en vage.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.880]   Tábien.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.560]   Pébé la piu.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.560]   We'll really enjoy that.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:00.520]   Léf from Aja de Fupomalede.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.960]   Ovelede from Aja.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:09.160]   Did we do this story?
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.680]   No, I guess we did it on Sunday.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.440]   You know Halsey.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.080]   Do you like Halsey?
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:12.800]   I like Halsey.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.960]   I like her work.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.560]   Do we do this story last week, Joucher?
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.520]   No idea.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.200]   So she has a new record.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.560]   Jeff, know who Halsey is?
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.600]   Do you know who Halsey is?
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.320]   You would like her music.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:22.880]   Find out.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.880]   I'll play a little.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.440]   Listen, here's a little bit of her music.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.920]   So this is a TikTok that she posted.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.720]   I'm not going to play the whole thing because I don't want
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.640]   to Halsey to get mad at me.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.400]   But she posted a TikTok.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.280]   Now, maybe this was a publicity stint.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   I don't know.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.560]   So she's playing the song and then, you know,
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.360]   how they unticktock texts over it.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.600]   Basically, she wrote, "I have a song I love.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.480]   I want to release ASAP, but my record label won't let me.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.000]   I've been in this industry for eight years.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.680]   I've sold over 165 million records.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.520]   And my record company is saying, I can't release it
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.760]   until they can fake a viral moment on TikTok.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.840]   Everything is marketing.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.400]   And they're doing this to basically every artist these days.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.280]   I just want to release music, man.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   And I deserve better TBH.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.880]   I'm tired."
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:19.840]   In fact, after this, a lot of others artists said, yeah,
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.440]   that's right.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:26.520]   Our labels say, go viral on TikTok or we-- that's not a single.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:33.240]   Gavin DeGraw shared a parody version of his 2003 hit,
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.320]   singing, "I don't want to be on TikTok,
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.880]   but my label told me I have to."
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.360]   English songwriter FKA Twigs said,
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.680]   "Our label is not only making your create and post TikTok
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:49.480]   videos, but they wanted to post videos multiple times a day."
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.000]   So what the heck is Lizzo doing on TikTok?
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   A, because she's got the song you can't escape.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.160]   But B, Lizzo's always on TikTok.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:57.600]   Well--
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.560]   She responds to everything.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.720]   And I'm like, she just like, OK.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.560]   She likes it.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.720]   And she's even got a TikTok dance.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.000]   So this article in T&W says, "Lizzo regularly
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.640]   shares memes, vlogs, and recipe videos on TikTok.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.960]   And heavily promoted her most recent release,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.400]   it's about damn time."
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.720]   She was--
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   Please don't do your head like this.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.720]   I can't do the head.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.240]   Jesus.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.000]   Can you do it?
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.120]   Just let Lizzo do it.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:28.720]   No, just--
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.000]   No, I can't.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   No, I cannot.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.720]   And I'm not going to tell you.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.800]   I want to be able to.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.400]   I can't.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:36.760]   You get in there?
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.120]   Actually, here's what you do for that.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:39.920]   You do.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.920]   It's about damn time.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.680]   It's about--
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.600]   Oh, and you clap them.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.720]   That's actually the move.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:45.320]   Here we go.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:45.840]   Ready?
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.360]   Turn it up.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.520]   Here we go.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.400]   It's about damn time.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.480]   There you go.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:50.960]   OK.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:51.920]   She's--
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:52.680]   All right.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.360]   Everybody do it.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.560]   That damn time.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.280]   It's about damn time.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.080]   You go in a minute.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.920]   In a minute.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.040]   In a one minute.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.760]   In one minute.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.280]   I'm Anita.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280]   I'm Anita.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.720]   You sit on them.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:07.720]   Sit on them.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.280]   Men on women.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.720]   Men on women.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.360]   Not men on women.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.680]   Men on women.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.640]   Men on women.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.040]   So pump me up.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.240]   So pump me up.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:16.760]   OK.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760]   Let me have a good one.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.760]   Me up.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.240]   No.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.200]   Pump me up.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.440]   Pump me up.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.000]   OK.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.240]   OK.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.680]   This is fuzzy.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.720]   Walking in my--
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.920]   This is how you do the dance.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.040]   I love Lizzo.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:29.960]   And by the way--
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.520]   I was waiting for you to do your dancing here.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.240]   God bless her because she's not wearing any makeup
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:34.840]   or anything.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.640]   She looks great.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.640]   I just love her.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.680]   She's real.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.480]   Well, she's playing her--
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.520]   I think her internet persona is close to who she is.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.480]   And she has created an authentic version.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.040]   Oh, Lizzo.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.240]   Ozzy's.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.200]   You know, what gets me with this story is--
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.800]   What is-- what is--
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.760]   Melissa Young's--
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.680]   That was C.F.C.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.200]   What hurt?
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.200]   Fuck is this?
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:34:59.680]   OK.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.360]   I was going to--
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.280]   No, don't do that.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.120]   Melissa Young's--
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:02.620]   C.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:04.400]   Melissa Young's-- C.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.400]   You got to end it.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.560]   You kept going.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.440]   That was not right.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.280]   I love her.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.880]   I love her.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.480]   23.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.440]   You should check her.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.040]   She can play the flute, which I knew.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.560]   She's a very good floutist.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.080]   She can play the flute.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.040]   Did you see her at the Met Gala?
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.200]   She has her flute.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.960]   She throws it off her cape, plays up, and she says,
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.800]   that's all you're getting.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   And moves.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.520]   Smart.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.760]   Smart.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.880]   You got to pay for this.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:28.720]   You got to pay for this.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.800]   You know, what I get about this story
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.200]   is there are artists that are in that position of saying,
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.920]   where the labels tell them they need to go viral and TikTok.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.560]   But there's just as many artists out there
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.720]   that sort of live in the whole democratization
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.080]   of creative arts where they're--
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:45.800]   That's a good point.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.760]   --going to TikTok first.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.400]   That's a good point.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.600]   And then the labels will come into them after.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.040]   You know, it's like they have the leverage then.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.600]   And I don't get why they want to just--
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.760]   why they won't just do this themselves and say,
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.120]   you know what?
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.600]   I'm just going to build a bigger audience,
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.000]   because maybe another label is going to come to me
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.200]   because of my following, not saying,
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.680]   I have to have a certain type of following.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.840]   Like this guy, the main lobster man.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.760]   So this is quite possibly the biggest lobster
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:16.840]   that we have ever caught.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.240]   The only reason we were able to catch it
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.880]   is because he has small claws.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.880]   At some point in his life, he lost his claws.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:22.960]   He grew back some new ones.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.880]   So unfortunately--
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.680]   Oh, I thought he was going to sing or something, Jeff.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   I thought he was going to throw up the body, but it just--
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.960]   Jeff, Jeff, put this in.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:29.480]   He's in here.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.640]   He's a 100-year-old lobster.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.320]   He's going to eat it.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.720]   Throw it back in.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.160]   He's going, that can't be good.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.920]   My father has very likely caught this lobster at one point
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.000]   in his life.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.160]   So is my grandfather.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.680]   What?
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.440]   And possibly my great-grandfather--
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:42.920]   What?
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.360]   --is to caught it.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.600]   If you want to get crazy, it's possible
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.080]   that my great-great-grandfather caught that lobster
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:48.840]   when he was a baby.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:51.480]   They've all fished the same area for years.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.400]   Well, that's kind of cool.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.960]   He got to migrate through the same areas.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.240]   But your great-great-grandfather,
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.680]   when he caught it, would have had it.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.920]   A lot of people didn't really understand it.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.440]   All right.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.840]   It could have been good eating it in.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.240]   My grandfather had caught it.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.440]   They would have been legal size.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:03.960]   But--
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:04.460]   See?
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:04.960]   That's it.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.560]   It explains.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.040]   When he was young, could have been too small or too big.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.960]   This lobster would have been--
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.360]   Oh my god.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.880]   Lobsters look so much like spiders.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.400]   And I cannot--
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.040]   I know.
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:13.560]   I know.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.040]   I know.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:14.440]   I know.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:14.960]   I know.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.460]   I know.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:15.960]   I know.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.480]   Anyway--
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.680]   At the end, he gives it a fish and sends it on.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.280]   There he gives it a--
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.800]   Oh, he feeds it.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.080]   He says, here you go, lobster.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:22.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.320]   I scared you and go have a fish.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:26.840]   He's pretty healthy, though.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.040]   Let's say someone rocks into your house.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:29.400]   Yes.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.080]   He pulls you out at, like, done point.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:31.600]   I know.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.080]   He totally traumatizes you.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.040]   And they give you a fish.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.200]   Like, who cares?
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:35.640]   Like, who cares?
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.160]   It wouldn't happen in Sweden.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.280]   They wouldn't give you a fish.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.200]   They just say lobster, you're on your own.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.640]   Just throw you back.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.120]   No, you just--
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.480]   I thought someone else was cooking you through.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.880]   Lobster, go on.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.240]   This is for you.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.240]   This is nasty.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.160]   [SIGHS]
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.720]   The joy of watching--
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.240]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:01.840]   This is fun.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.920]   This is another Jeff.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:03.680]   I'm warning you.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.760]   Yes, it is.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.680]   The joy of watching a movie.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:10.480]   OK.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.400]   All right, I love this.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.240]   I see a lot of it.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.200]   Do a Snapchat filter.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.200]   So what he does is he's watching "There Will Be Blood."
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.880]   Great movie, very serious.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.360]   Is it Daniel Day-Lewis?
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:20.920]   Who's in it?
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.440]   Who's in it?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.080]   It is.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:22.480]   Yes, it's--
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.240]   Barry, you know.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.520]   You drink my milk drink.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.800]   I drink your milk drink.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.200]   So he decides to filter him through the Googly-eye Snapchat
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:30.680]   filter.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:33.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.680]   It's not quite the same.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.160]   Let's turn on the sound here.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.680]   Get the full effect.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.400]   Now I am a sinner.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:41.920]   I'm a sinner.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.400]   Say it louder.
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.520]   I am a sinner.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.040]   I'm a sinner.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.120]   Louder, Daniel.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.200]   I am a sinner.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.320]   I am a sinner.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.160]   I am sorry, Lord.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160]   I'm sorry, Lord.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:52.640]   I want--
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.840]   Oh, that's just creepy.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.840]   It's creepy.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840]   It's creepy.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.000]   There's other stuff.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.280]   Oh, yeah, go up or down.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.920]   This is the second one of the thread.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:04.320]   What movie is this?
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.360]   So how do you do that?
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.160]   I'm going to send some dirty words there.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.280]   I'm not going to play the sound.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:09.880]   I don't want to take that.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.800]   How do you do this?
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.000]   You point your camera--
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.240]   So what's a new filter?
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.800]   The article below says this is--
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.800]   I forgot what they call it-- is a certain filter.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.000]   It's like a Googly-eye filter.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.600]   I don't know how we then watch the movie through it.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.200]   I'm going to watch everything.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.280]   You know, this--
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.480]   You know what's going to stop?
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.680]   I've been wondering what the killer app for years, what's
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.480]   going to be the killer app for virtual reality
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.040]   or augmented reality glasses.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.200]   Imagine your augmented reality glasses
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.840]   could make everybody you meet look like that.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.440]   As you're walking down the street--
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.360]   Oh, hey, Aunt.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.040]   Life will be either way more fun or way more creepy.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.480]   Wow.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.840]   So what's the name of that filter?
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:54.600]   Because I want to--
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.400]   It's the next line below.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.200]   It's called me.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.080]   I should have remembered that.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.000]   It looks like a--
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.640]   It's a-- here's the good--
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.080]   Here's the--
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.520]   The good, the bad, the ugly.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.240]   Eli Wallach, and 20.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120]   Yeah, maybe the best.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.280]   I don't know how to disprove this.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.040]   Cute ex to sea of gold.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.520]   [WHISTLE]
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.080]   Sorry, audio people.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.360]   So we've got to put up a--
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.320]   How do I do this filter?
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.000]   Well, hold on.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   What's it say there?
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.160]   Let me see here.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.240]   What's the name of the filter?
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.360]   So it's called the shuk.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.160]   Shuk.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:35.800]   OK, let me see if I can cast this.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.360]   Oh, I found it.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   OK.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.800]   Hey!
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.800]   Hey, kids!
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.160]   I got an airplane this.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.480]   Oh, that's amazing.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.280]   Do you see it now?
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.800]   Do you see me now?
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.400]   Yeah, there you are.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.000]   I look like Gary Vaynerchuk.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]   Oh, my god.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   Oh, no.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   So not good.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]   OK, let's see what--
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]   Oh, geez.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]   Let's see what Jarvis looks like, actually.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.520]   That's something we can do here.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.440]   Let's see what-- see Jeff Jarvis.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]   Hey, Jeff!
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.520]   Stacey, Stacey!
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   Super disturbing.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.520]   Oh!
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.520]   Oh!
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:20.520]   Oh!
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.520]   Oh!
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.520]   Oh, that's more likely.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]   Oh, there we go.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520]   That's more like it.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   Oh!
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.080]   I was like, I have a wig like that.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.080]   So I--
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.080]   Oh!
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.960]   Yeah, I think with the hay seed coming out of your mouth.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:34.960]   But I don't know where it's shook.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.960]   The hay seed is--
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:36.960]   Oh, look at that.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.960]   Oh, wow.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   Oh!
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960]   Oh!
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960]   Oh!
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.960]   Oh!
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.960]   Oh!
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.960]   Oh!
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   Oh!
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.960]   Oh!
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:47.960]   Let's see if it can fix Jeff.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:49.960]   No, it can't help you at all.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:51.960]   It doesn't help you at all.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:52.960]   There's no help.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.960]   There's no help.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:54.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.920]   This is a frequency separation.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920]   Oh!
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.920]   Oh!
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920]   Oh!
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   Oh!
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920]   Dude, I look Asian?
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.920]   Oh, boo!
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   Very different.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.320]   I almost looked like Filipino, like Joe Koi.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   There you go.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.320]   That's your cat, Kawaki.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.320]   That's it right there.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:15.160]   With the hay seed, I'll tell you what.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.240]   So, I got to find--
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.920]   What about-- I want-- I want-- I want-- I want J m r b, J m r b.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.360]   You got to walk over there for J m r b.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.240]   Come on over there, Mr. J m r b.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.480]   Let me find a good one for J m r b, though.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480]   Ah, I'm busy.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.480]   He says he's busy.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.480]   I'm busy.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480]   I got one for J m r b.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.480]   I got one for J m r b.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   I'm trying to manage this.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.480]   I want to go.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.480]   Hey, Blake!
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.680]   You know, this is so stupid.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.120]   This is so stupid.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.680]   God bless the internet, folks.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.680]   God bless the internet.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.680]   Bless the internet.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.680]   Oh!
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.680]   Leave J m r b alone!
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.680]   Oh!
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:55.680]   No!
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.680]   I can't find anything.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.080]   He says, I got off my sick bed for this.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   I can't.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:06.480]   I want to find the shuk-tuh-snook-tuh-n.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480]   Although I think all movies--
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.480]   There we go.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480]   There we go.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   There we go.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.480]   Let's see Jeff Jarvis now.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:14.040]   I got to flip you around here.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.880]   Let's see Jeff Jarvis now.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880]   Oh, my.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880]   That is-- that's the internet.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.160]   That's the inner Jeff channeling right through that one.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.160]   This is so childish.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.160]   It's like seriously disturbing.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.160]   This is so childish.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.160]   You do?
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   Oh, gosh.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.160]   Run.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160]   Oh, God, it gives you chills.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.160]   Run.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.600]   That was worse than the spider lobster.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   Oh!
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]   OK.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Oh, see?
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.440]   Thank you, TikTok, for showing us.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.440]   Thank you, TikTok.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440]   And thank you, Snapchat.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.440]   Thank you, internet.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.440]   Thank you, internet.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:48.440]   Yes.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.840]   See, they want the bad guys want to shut the--
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:50.840]   I'm going to put this all down.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:51.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.840]   [SIGHS]
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.840]   [SIGHS]
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.440]   Mr. Jarvis, I've been sharing to TikTok more often.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.440]   Have you noticed that?
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.440]   Have you?
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.480]   Hey, what do you put on there?
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.400]   Just random-- the same stuff that I would sort of put on Instagram, where you--
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400]   Yes.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.400]   --I'd just put it on TikTok.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.400]   Is it fascinating?
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:10.400]   It's fascinating.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.400]   It's nothing to follow you.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.600]   They don't-- you and Salt Hank, I don't see--
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:14.960]   Yeah, it's all imaginary following.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.960]   Right.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.960]   You just have to search for them, basically.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.960]   It's nothing.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.440]   Oh, you're putting a lot of stuff up there.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.680]   What are you thinking of dancing, Ant?
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.680]   That would be no.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.680]   [LAUGHS]
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:26.880]   I had put it on the musical.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.600]   I've just been noticing some weird activity with Instagram, so I said, I'm going to start
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   checking out TikTok to see if I get the same type of performance, because I'm looking
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.840]   at analytics, not that I'm a Salt Hank or anything.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:48.000]   But, you know, I only have like 100 or so followers on TikTok, and I'll get 300, 400
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000]   different views.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000]   Oh, this is the--
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000]   --on TikTok.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.920]   Well, you know, versus Instagram, it's like my dog is barely getting seen.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.120]   Everybody loves a dog.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.200]   1200 views on that one.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:00.760]   What's your handle again?
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:01.760]   It's--
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   Yeah, underscore.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   --and underscore.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.760]   Right.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.760]   Yes, sir.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.760]   There you are.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.760]   There you are.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.760]   Oh, I thought I already follow you.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760]   I didn't follow you now.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760]   Okay.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:11.760]   Oh.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:15.500]   But I've been playing with it just to see how it's going to pan out from an analytics
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:20.240]   standpoint, because it seems like Instagram, they're doing changes with how they're trying
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:22.620]   to prioritize things.
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.660]   So they want you to do more reels.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.580]   And then I saw that-- what's his name?
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:27.580]   Misori?
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:28.580]   Adam Misori.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.580]   --that's how you pronounce this?
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:30.580]   Misori?
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.580]   Adam Misori.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.580]   Misori.
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.580]   Misori.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:34.580]   Misori.
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:35.580]   Misori.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.580]   Misori.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.580]   Misori.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:38.580]   Misori.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:40.540]   The potential of having more vertical photographs show up on the regular feed versus it just being
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:41.980]   inside of these stories.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:45.460]   So I've even changed how I put my images on there, because I used to do them in a
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.860]   one-to-one aspect ratio.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:52.060]   Now I do them in a four to five aspect ratio, because they're a little bit longer just to
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.940]   see how it performs there.
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:59.340]   And it's still weird, because it seems like my reach is going down in Instagram, but my
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:01.900]   reach is going up in TikTok.
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:08.060]   Even though I have like 3,500 followers in Instagram versus 100 followers.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.100]   This is the fascinating thing about TikTok.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:13.140]   And it's the thing my son is always trying to figure out and study.
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:14.660]   And he does A/B experiments.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.620]   He does all sorts of stuff to see what generates more traffic.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:21.580]   He tells me it's the likes, not the views.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:24.300]   Now I'm getting likes in TikTok.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.140]   My phone is always saying so-and-so like me, not that I'm getting more followers, but
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140]   there's always a like.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.380]   No, and the likes are important.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.100]   I think he says that's a signal to TikTok.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.660]   And of course, the ultimate goal is to get TikTok to promote it.
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:38.180]   Then it shows up, see the in the 4U pages.
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.180]   People's 4U pages.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:44.500]   Which is, see, no, the 4U follow doesn't seem to do anything, but 4U page is critical.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.500]   So, yeah.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.740]   Stay in Tartar 7.1 million views for him.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:49.740]   Way to go.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.980]   I mean, he's 2.1 million followers now.
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.140]   He's not posting a lot lately.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:55.140]   I don't know.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.140]   Maybe he's gotten, he got busy.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.140]   I don't know.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.140]   He went to New York.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.100]   He's probably talking to the agents and all that stuff.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   I don't know.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.100]   He's got a book.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   He's too big for you now.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.100]   I don't even talk to him.
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:05.100]   Good for you.
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.100]   Oh, good for you.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.740]   I have to get his agent on the line and say, can I say-
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.460]   You're the John Voight of TikTok, yeah.
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.180]   The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon.
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:19.360]   little bug blue in a man google docs. Oh, no, this is the change log
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:23.940]   Should I do a change log this week? What do you think? You didn't do a lot of H A C. I didn't do it last week
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:30.740]   Cuz it was so lame there was lame no fact no name a bad word Jason is lame a bad word can I use a bad word?
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:34.740]   Yes, he's technically it was so pathetic. Can I say pith, right?
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:40.140]   Ruffin. Yeah, she can say that amber ruffin did a really good thing on words that she's like retiring
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:47.420]   This was like two years ago, and it's a really good little thing. I'm never gonna say if somebody calls himself that you shouldn't you shouldn't use it
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:51.740]   Depercating fashion lame means halt that you have a limp your half a halting out
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:59.980]   Yeah, okay. Well, it's derogatory if I mean when we use lame we use it not like you can say this horses lane
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:02.260]   Then because it really is
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:04.340]   Right because you're describing
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:07.500]   Someone who you say person is lame because they're they're limping it
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:12.540]   But but if you use it as an insult is a problem or use it as a negative a derogatory term
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:16.300]   I understand that cuz you don't want to put down somebody who has a limp, but
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.540]   Honestly, this is lame
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:26.540]   Limping along I mean I think it's right now you're insulting Jason
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:34.700]   It's a metaphor it's a metaphor. It's not trying to put somebody down. It's just a metaphor
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.860]   I understand I won't use it, but I do I worry that some point we're gonna not really think no
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:45.780]   I really think you're reaching here because okay, so this one is limping along you could just say it's a limping along
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:50.180]   But when you say lame like that you are saying something derogatory about a changelog
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.180]   You're not saying that the changelog can't walk
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:55.620]   Once you move to the metaphorical space you're really on
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:00.100]   Can we see that facial expression again
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.660]   Can I see that on the
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.420]   Filter please that's where I really want to see it
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:11.700]   Okay, I'm sorry, it's true. No, it's good
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:16.860]   It's okay to say this is a trash changelog is it?
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.940]   But you can't say it's trailer trash changelog
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:25.940]   No, that would that would then be insulting to trailer trash
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:31.620]   Yes, if it's a person associated with the insult
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:38.460]   Then you can't use it. That's pretty much that makes sense. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. I
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:44.660]   Am glad I'm an old man because I I can get away with this. They just say okay boomer
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:47.340]   This changelog is compost
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:53.540]   This is a terrible changelog, but there's even no
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:50:00.300]   Terrible means was what is terrible me literally terrible. This is a dull changelog doll is so
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:03.940]   dull is a dull adjective dull
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.860]   So but I'm gonna work harder to be a better writer and I'm gonna come up with a good word
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:12.100]   This changelog is lambent
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:18.580]   You're talking about last week's changelog. Do you know that this week's is bad? No, I haven't even looked at this one yet
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.300]   That's the thing. See you're being triply unfair
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:28.340]   No, I was I was saying something nice about it. It's lamp. I now can't see your faces a refolgent. It's gonna pop out
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:39.740]   Says as long as there is a changelog section in the document I will continue to fill it with terrible news
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:47.900]   Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Jason. We can make fun of them about meat. No, we can't do anything to we are
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:50.540]   We're gonna play the trumpets or not. Yeah, I go I play the trumpets. All right
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:53.100]   Google changelog
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:51:00.420]   Number 109 no, this is a big story actually. Yeah, actually so again with the messaging
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:06.860]   Google is changing things up and the brandy wrong one John this one. What the hell's going on?
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:10.420]   Where did I lose control
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.940]   This one in front of me Google is combining meat and duo
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.820]   Into a single app
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.380]   They're gonna call it deep or is it Moo-oh?
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:25.060]   I don't know. It's even dumber than that. They're gonna call it meat, but it's actually built on do it is duo
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:30.380]   But they're so basically they're changing the name. Yeah. Yeah exactly. They're a champ by the way
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:35.940]   I love your nails. The dale look great. Yeah, those are cool. Is that something you did while you're doing this commercial isolation?
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:43.220]   So this is actually the day before I test a positive. It's so old and you can tell if you see how much my nails have grown out
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:48.340]   But I just kind of got lazy. I didn't have nail polish. No, I like that color. It's kind of a light blue
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.700]   Yeah, cool blue Google is
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:58.140]   Pretty soon there will only be Google meat, but
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:01.860]   It will be duo
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:08.780]   Does this mean I have to invite everybody on to duo again because you know, it's hard to convince people in the first place
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:11.540]   and they just
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:18.620]   So duo which is like FaceTime, right? It's like it's for a video calls I use it with my daughter because she's an Android user
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.380]   It's great in fact it has that nice feature where you knock
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:25.780]   So when you call somebody if you want it will show your video
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:29.980]   So the person can see with that answering I can see that you're calling so you can kind of
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:34.780]   You know talk to me, please I beg of you that kind of thing
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:39.100]   It's so meat which is their zoom, right?
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:46.420]   I don't know if they're gonna add zoom like or meat like features into duo. It's not clear
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:52.420]   It's just it's very it's as usual. It is so Google
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.780]   Google is gonna
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:53:01.220]   This is from the verge as the two services become one Google is leaning on duo's mobile app as the default
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:08.220]   Pretty soon the duo app will get an update that brings an onslaught of meat features into the platform
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:15.460]   Later this year the duo app will be renamed Google meat the current meat Apple be called meat original
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:22.720]   And then there's Google is this a nice way of saying they're killing duo. No, they're killing me
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:27.980]   Killing me, but it's like the only thing I use on a regular we use it
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:32.180]   But but you can continue to use meat and it and and it'll have some
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:36.820]   Big doughnuts the duo mobile app
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:44.420]   According to Dave Citron the director of product for Google's video products the dual mobile app had a lot of sophistication
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:47.980]   Especially he's got to explain this especially under the hood
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:52.820]   Especially in emerging markets where network connectivity with sparse are highly available
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:54:00.820]   Variable on the web it's different meat is much more developed web. So it forms the base of the new combined system
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:03.420]   But in both cases the idea is
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:06.300]   100% of the functionality
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.180]   Blindforces and no users left behind that's the the line today anyway
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:16.380]   What is wrong with these guys okay
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.660]   It feels like every time there's a new manager
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:26.500]   They they put their mark on it and they change it and then then a year later. It's another thing. It's canine editing
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:33.180]   You lift your leg and this is one precise. I like that canine editing. I know what you're saying. This is one to try system
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.180]   Are we insulting dogs? Yes
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:42.300]   This is the Google change log leg lift edition
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:48.540]   What did you what did you ask him you said something? No, I'm saying shitting put chai step in
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:54.220]   I mean this is the type of stuff that a CEO should sort of rain in and you're like look we need to get our crap together
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.260]   Yeah leadership folks clearly there is none yeah
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:05.740]   And I this is Mike Elkins contention is that put chai is not a very good leader and I have to say I think so what
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:13.220]   Google Docs is getting up now you can do this one a big upgrade in formatting you could change multiple blocks of text at once
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:22.020]   You have great Leo. It's not just not great. It's a big upgrade
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.660]   Let's see here's project black prior
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:30.660]   So you have these two blocks project overview and market trends and you want to change the bold on both
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:38.260]   Select both and change change them both to bold and they both get changed even though they're discontinuous
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:42.940]   Discontinuous blocks of text so you hold the command or control key
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:50.220]   Holding it down select the other bits. You can understand how to do that. That's that's always been a way to get an all in those word power users
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:54.100]   Hiked up mmm. Maybe I could I could use that
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:55.260]   so
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:59.020]   Yeah, I could too. Okay, and if you have the paintbrush, you know
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:02.820]   What you could do is get one of those exactly as you wanted here
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:10.020]   He is changing all the fonts and everything and then really ugly making it so ugly and then selecting all the other ones and making
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:16.100]   Them the same it's just it's just a formatting isn't that the format payment in word. Yeah, right very simply
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:21.420]   Google says the feature will gradually roll out to everybody's accounts over the next 15 days
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:26.460]   So look for it in a Google Doc near you
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:30.300]   By the way, can I can I can I just interrupt one second here?
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.540]   Because it's what I do so I just had to send out invitations to an event
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:36.740]   I hope to have that covid willing at the end of the month
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:43.340]   Yeah, it's enough 40 emails because of my but dear beloved chrome book and I could save up to five things
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:48.900]   Separate things and then insert them whichever one I wanted right that Chromebook feature that came out a couple years ago
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:53.220]   Yeah, it was it was heavenly. I saved the to do I saved the names
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:58.580]   I saved the subject line. I saved the body of the email boom boom boom boom boom
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:03.140]   It's wonderful good. It's possible because you have chroma. I just want to say that. I just haven't good
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.860]   Fair enough. That's pure. It's like our user. What's a Chromebook?
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:12.740]   YouTube for Android and iOS guy and

[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:23.860]   I have no idea what the whole great. This is exactly what we need in the world
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:34.980]   You see your commenting and sharing on you, okay, fine
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:39.540]   I don't know what my television from me TV. I guess that's the idea, right? That's it. Yes
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:44.420]   By the way, Google has launched a new app in the app store and iOS
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:48.940]   Google TV has is an is a new app the Google TV app
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:53.120]   iPhone users can get recommendations from across streaming apps a
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:58:00.620]   Watchlist for the discoveries of 4u tab with watch lists from their favorite stars on the go content library the ability to rate movies and shows

[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.900]   Iced devices the only thing you can't do is actually watch any of these shows
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:19.540]   Can you they don't mention that I'm this kind of replaces Google Play movies and TV I guess
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.060]   It's really built on duo
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.700]   Yes
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.100]   Google Play movies which was dead because it's now YouTube movies
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:36.100]   We're gonna build it on the Google Play with some Google Plus if you had the Google Play movies and TV app on iOS
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:42.900]   And you didn't delete it when they you know deprecated it it will turn into the new Google TV app
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:47.440]   I was remiss. I should have downloaded this on iOS before
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:55.440]   The show I forgot I meant to I wanted to bring an apple product to the show I do as well as a pixel 6
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.420]   I got both
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:59.380]   Okay, okay. Don't worry. All right. Just relax
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:06.060]   It's funny because it's thinks I've already downloaded this you know how you get the like you already downloaded
[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:11.500]   It's not a new one. So I don't maybe that's because I had play to movies and TVs before that's interesting
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.100]   Search across streaming, but I want to check this because my question is can I play?
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.460]   something
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:26.620]   But maybe I don't know welcome to Google TV you can tell them what you subscribe to huh do we care?
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:29.100]   No, it's changed lock. I care. I care
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:35.220]   It seems like it's kind of silly if all you can do is search for a state as he stays
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:38.500]   He's had short down. So let me let me watch something
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:44.020]   I mean, this is move along. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but when you say watch now, it then
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:50.080]   Opens up the other app or the web. So it is just really kind of a search thing
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:55.300]   All right, this is for you, Jeff. You better enjoy it Chrome OS
[01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:58.420]   102 is rolling out
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:04.260]   USB C cable alerts oh
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:07.340]   You bought the wrong cable you idiot
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:11.580]   Yes, yes, that's actually what it does. That's fantastic
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:18.020]   It'll alert you when USB C cables don't support a display or quote isn't performing ideally for your laptop
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:25.420]   Or if it doesn't support USB 4 Thunderbolt 3 standards if and that your Chromebook does etc etc
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:27.420]   So this is great. This is
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.220]   Thank you Benson Leung who is the guy
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:36.340]   Remember this was reviewing type you was he was the yeah the USB cop on Amazon
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:41.340]   He was saying this one doesn't work this one does he is a viewer. He is in our Twitch social
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:45.940]   Mastin on instance, and I thank you very much. This is awesome
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.500]   And Glenn Fleischman is an expert in USB says well our new friend. Yeah
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:55.260]   Benson says all USB C cables even those without logos and that's the big problem
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:01:01.700]   They're supposed to put logos on there, but they never do identify themselves to the computer precisely using PD
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:09.900]   My team reads that in front now. We eliminate a silent failure failure when the user uses a USB 2.0 cable with a DP
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:11.900]   Docker monitor we give you a warning
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:14.500]   Thank you Benson
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:18.220]   That's right somebody didn't come up with a hardware device. You could test your USB cable
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:24.500]   Well, you have one now it's called a Chromebook or yeah, I don't have another reason another reason to get a Chromebook
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:28.820]   Well, this okay, so will Chrome OS 102
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:34.900]   Probably won't be on will it be on all Chromebooks have you updated yet? I'm not it's up to you right now good
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.340]   It's very so that's nice double tapping on a zip will
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:44.740]   Now added that you said attract extract all option in the menu
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:48.340]   That's kind of what happens on a desktop, you know normal computer
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:51.300]   Good good. This is good
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.060]   Chrome OS 102
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:56.700]   Thank you see what's new and that's
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:02.300]   The Google changed see that wasn't anything that was
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:04.980]   refolgent it was
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:08.180]   Folgents
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:14.020]   Webster's is taking insult
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:17.820]   I've got this this earth open and I'm not afraid to use it
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:22.100]   dot - Meredith targeting print investments
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:29.540]   So this is interesting is you know the dot - Meredith also time much of time. It is there killed my baby
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.540]   I entered him a weekly imprint
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.420]   along with
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.500]   eating well and other magazines in print and
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:39.860]   Now and there was a report two weeks ago. I don't think we mentioned on the show
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:45.940]   That people magazine might actually go out of print. We did mention that on the show. We did a big story
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:50.860]   Yes, they lowered the circulation from three and a half three point two million to two point eight million
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:56.220]   Just amazing. So now what they're saying is yeah, you know this mass stuff these big print stuff
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:59.420]   Yeah, we're not so much to that but little tiny niche stuff in print works
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:06.380]   So it to me it marks once again the end of the era of mass media is the print it doesn't support you know
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:07.540]   you gotta you gotta
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:12.980]   bribe people with with premiums and all kinds of stuff you get them subscribed to a magazine just so you get advertising
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.780]   You can't get it anymore that market is gone, but
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:18.900]   Witness this company
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.380]   enthusiast stuff
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:26.260]   They're saying slow works in Prince O'leo. I think you should come up with the twit magazine is what this says
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.060]   Yeah, that's interesting
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:34.100]   I think they mean putting Harry Styles on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens is what they mean
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:40.620]   That's what they're really saying. This is an axios story by Sarah Fisher. Thank you Sarah
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:46.020]   There is a typo Sarah because it says the company has several core print tittles
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:51.980]   They're in a chore
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:59.660]   Actually well and your spell checker would not actually say tittle is bad is not a word because it is it's a jot and a tittle
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:03.420]   people better homes and gardens real simple flat and wine
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:10.660]   It's a it's a bible thing. You just would I see travel and leisure all recipes magnolia and southern living are
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:13.940]   core print tittles
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:23.780]   Is the name of the company dot - Mary yes, it is yes, what's with it dot - that's the that's that's that's the let the
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:31.220]   The successor to all the stuff that Barry Diller put together and he he rebrand stuff like Google does
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:36.540]   And he named it's all content factories and he named it dot - includes college humor
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:42.340]   I think still I forget what all so one of the things - put out a business was brides in 2019, but now
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:49.180]   They're thinking of bringing it back because that is I guess which I used to work on but really is really
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:57.900]   Five pieces every true so absolutely must have
[02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:07.260]   So they're gonna add small pieces of print not economically relevant to some of our other print brands according to somebody
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:13.260]   This is interesting. They're just basically trying to save the magazine business
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:18.540]   But when they put Harry Styles on the cover of better homes and gardens, which does not
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:27.140]   Compute really what is normally on the cover better homes and gardens a whole regard fruit cakes cakes houses houses?
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:30.700]   Yeah, not not says normally houses rock stars gorgeous
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:36.380]   The company took a big gamble last month by putting Harry Styles on the cover of better homes and gardens
[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:39.700]   But it paid off the first day of the Harry Styles issue
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:46.620]   We did not put a link of how to buy the magazine online anywhere and we sold 15,000 copies
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:54.620]   Well, we've always known that famous people sell magazine covers. I mean, that's not new BH and G
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:57.260]   Which is how I called the tittle
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:02.980]   Used to have seven million subscribers. It's now four million used to
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:07.700]   Is you're getting rid of junk circulation some circulation
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:11.380]   Yeah, it was worth it when you had the ads right when the ads go down
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:13.380]   It's not worth it to support the junk circulation anymore
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:18.900]   So they've got all kinds of breath. They have eating well food and wine the more niche all recipes
[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:22.940]   It's funny cuz that's exactly what Ziff Davis did when they got on a computer magazine
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:27.460]   See they went more you know left some of the mainstream titles behind it went more narrow
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:31.260]   Speaking of Harry Styles the Jonas Brothers
[02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:38.180]   Her backing a new subscription media biz for celebs text. Why does that have to do with?
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:43.300]   Harry Styles. I don't know. He's kind of celebrity famous person. Oh
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:47.340]   Was he what was he what was Harry Styles in?
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:56.420]   Was boring right now he was in a band. Yeah, I don't understand the Harry Styles thing is kind of beyond me
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:58.420]   But there's definitely yeah, it was he had a band
[02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:02.580]   I mean, he says oh no he went on the X factor
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:10.820]   Just his own he's just his own thing. Oh, he was in one direction. That's what I thought one direction one direction
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:13.620]   One direction. I remember them
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:17.760]   Anyway, Harry is has nothing to do with this story
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:25.540]   The Jonas Brothers, which I don't you know what it is in my mind that Jonas Brothers and one direction and BTS and things you're too old
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:31.080]   All these boy bands are kind of similar basically the same thing to you, right? Yeah, they're all the same me
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:37.980]   Jonas Brothers weren't they much earlier than one direction though? Well, maybe I don't know. I don't know the chronology we care
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:43.620]   I care yes, they sell magazines Jeff you should give a damn so
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:49.020]   Though Jonas Brothers are launching a new subscription media company called sub called scriber
[02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:55.460]   That allows celebrities to charge their biggest fans for exclusive contents via text messages
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:08:02.860]   Would you subscribe? Who's your who's your heart? Oh my god? It's like cameo with yeah words with text messages
[02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:07.980]   It's and it because it's text messages. They don't need an app. They don't have to go in the app store
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.980]   They don't have to pay 30% to Google or Apple
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:13.220]   Yeah, I old employer advanced
[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:17.780]   Did a company like this and they used for example in Cleveland where?
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:24.540]   You could get exclusive text to you for them from the sports columnist inside stuff as the game is going on things like that
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:29.860]   They estimate that the super fans represent about one to five percent of the total
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.140]   celebrities fan base
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:36.860]   So it's the top one percent of your find everywhere we everywhere we possibly can yeah
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:42.060]   Get money out of them, but the Jonas Brothers as an example have 50 million Instagram followers
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:48.860]   If just one percent subscribed that'd be 30 million dollars a year for the Jonas Brothers, right?
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:56.060]   So interesting this users can subscribe by texting go to a phone number provided by the celebrity on social media
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:02.180]   Unsubscribed by texting stomp or cancel you could set up recurring payments via Apple pay or credit card
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:06.980]   You'll get exclusive material behind the scenes videos. I think it's gonna be very successful
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:12.140]   Yeah, it's kind of like an isleo you're gonna start a text subscription. I should do this yeah
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:16.460]   Yeah, I should do this I think it's good seriously
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:24.760]   Super soon. It's true. Well, and it follows in a trend because Twitter's got the super follows right and yep
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:31.040]   TikTok has subscription support instagrams doing subscriptions. So kind of this is kind of the trend
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:33.940]   You know we were a little ahead of that with club to it
[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:38.780]   We said you know super fans and it's it's about one percent. Maybe I don't know
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:44.860]   Would pay seven bucks and we thought initially that was the big come on was no ads
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:52.300]   But really it is about the community and about getting all over talk to talk to the people and and have a cuz I'd conversation things like that
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.740]   So that gets that makes sense
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:10:01.760]   Story I want to hear what stasis take on is the Roomba operating system
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.760]   I
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:16.640]   Think she inhaled I'd have to bring that up
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:26.240]   I'm very excited about it
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.560]   Oh my god, I'm not making fun of you. I'm actually worried. Are you okay?
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:37.760]   But that's why I just might caution that yours your go-to reaction, which is
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:46.240]   It's you're not where beads make sure your earrings are well attached
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.360]   You know it's I can't breathe in very deeply still oh I see
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:57.320]   So whenever I try to breathe in deeply I end up not being able to and then my body's like crap
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.320]   We can't breathe anyway
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:05.480]   Good they have a new they have something now is this different?
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:11.360]   I mean of course it was always running software and an operating system. This is their new robot operating system
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:16.120]   By the way, we're gonna have oh, it's not robot operating system. I robot OS they call I robot
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:22.040]   Yeah, cuz there's actually a robot operating system. That's an open source robotics like industrial robotics OS
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.480]   It's pretty cool and then Apple's gonna launch their reality OS. We're gonna have a lot of our
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.280]   OS is not our OUS's that's gonna be confused but
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:33.640]   Roomba and there I
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:40.600]   Robot operating system is awesome because I think it is going to do what I've
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.920]   Actually wrote about it just a couple weeks ago. I was so pissed off because our smart home
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:51.560]   It's just these like disparate pieces and we get like Amazon coming in here with Astro their little robot thing
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.880]   But I'm like are you you have an Astro
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:12:00.360]   No, I don't have an Astro if I had an Astro. I would totally show you guys. Oh man. Yeah, are you gonna get it?
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.160]   Is that story are you interested?
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.680]   No, I mean it doesn't it doesn't have hands it doesn't work. It doesn't do nothing
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.160]   It doesn't do anything
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:18.640]   Unlike the iRobot which you yeah, I argue yeah that your smart home is the robot and this actually the software is
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:24.200]   what Roomba's trying to do is picture its little vacuum cleaner as part of this like
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:26.920]   property of other items in the home and
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.160]   It's got it. They mentioned its air purifier could be part of this
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.960]   But once you have matter and Roomba is participating in it
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.520]   You could actually pull in data about all the other devices plus their camera
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:40.320]   And then if you actually have an OS that makes those work together
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.160]   and
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:48.400]   It would probably be very privacy preserving because Roomba has been focused on that in ways that well they got in trouble because
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.640]   They were mapping people's houses. Okay
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:57.640]   So they didn't they got in trouble because people thought they were mapping people's houses and giving that data to Google
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:02.800]   But that's not actually what they kept it on an angle Roomba. They kept it locally. Yes
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:08.840]   So people in they they mapped your house they have to ask you that's part of the deal. Was that a moral panic per chance?
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:12.000]   Oh my god, it was
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.640]   It happens. Yeah
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.100]   Anyway, so I'm really excited about this as you can tell by me like not being
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:24.940]   Choking you can talk to it through echo or Google assistant or Siri
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:27.920]   You could say clean the living room
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:36.040]   Well, you could do that today. Oh, so what this is this is the next level of that is kind of this next layer of context and integration
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.920]   Is what they're working on today. They have like the beginnings of that
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.080]   As part of I think they call it their genius OS is what it is
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:49.160]   And it does things already like my Roomba will tell me it'll be like hey yo
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.200]   I
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.280]   See that your kitchen counter area has lots of crumbs
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:55.400]   Do you want to write over here by the kitchen counter?
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:59.040]   Do you want me to create a special cleaning spot for that? I'm like holy cow. Yes, I do
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:04.000]   Thank you. Oh and you could clean up every morning after breakfast or something like that. It would be smart enough to do that
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:11.840]   I mean, I have a dog. So it's not an issue, but well, they also say that you can during pet shedding season
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.920]   Which is right about now you can have the Roomba do extra cleaning where the pet hangs out
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.040]   So my only complaint
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:21.040]   We've had many Roombas
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:26.240]   They don't do a very good job. Are they doing a better job now? Do you use Roomba?
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:31.080]   Yeah, we I mean, okay, you still have to I actually talk a lot about this on my show
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:38.000]   Here's my point. I still have to vacuum, right? It doesn't eliminate the need to vacuum. I don't have to vacuum my hard floors
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.800]   I
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:44.680]   Do have to what I do vacuum my carpeted floors
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:52.840]   Once a week actually, I don't my husband does okay actually and he may not vacuum all is that because the Roomba does not do get them
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.520]   Well, yeah, I mean you just want a deeper clean right
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:03.560]   But if you that's strong enough, okay. Yeah, that was my question. Yeah, I did it picks up lots of stuff
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:08.920]   It does not and it picks up a lot of pet hair and the pet hair it doesn't pick up
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.480]   It kind of creates into these little balls that like hang out and then you're just like oh, there's a pet hair ball
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:20.000]   Well and the beauty of this is the Roomba will actually drive around animals like in this video
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:28.680]   Yeah, my dog in the Roomba get a lot just fine the dog is apparently getting a back scratch
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.200]   Right around that went around the nose is going down the way
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:42.080]   Enjoying it is it gonna do a tummy rub tummy rub it's trying to go in there. Oh, yeah
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:57.760]   No, I'm like pretty shame. Oh, thank you. Thank you. That was good. Oh, it's good for me. Was it good for you? That's good
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:01.680]   So I maybe we'll get a Roomba
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.760]   I don't know Lisa loved the Roomba and she used as evidence that the Roomba works
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:08.520]   She would say well look look at all this stuff. It picked up
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.960]   It means working but I know it does pick a little stuff. Yeah, but we still have to vacuum
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:19.920]   We have a we have a lot of carpets and an area rugs and stuff and then I told the story before the Roomba would get stuck
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.360]   Every night do you do your Roomba at night or do you do it?
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.520]   Because you're not supposed to do one people around this the hardest part about
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.800]   All of us working from home basically is when do you run the when do you Roomba?
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:36.920]   So we usually the way we don't schedule we just hit my Roomba's name is Terrence
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:41.020]   So I'll just say hey Google tell Terrence to vacuum the master bedroom. Oh, oh
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:43.440]   Terrence is about to turn sorry
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:52.320]   Terrence is running all right there I go boss. Oh, no my phone. Hold on. Okay. Oh, all right. Sorry
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.800]   This is life with Stacy. Well and another famous problem with the Roomba is that it would forgive me but
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.760]   Try not to do that pet poop
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:09.480]   It is now since learned. Okay. I mean that's that's the beauty of these learning systems the software update. Yeah
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:15.520]   I love my Roomba. So I mean we use it every day and
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:25.040]   $250 for the new one the J7 plus oh, yeah, but it comes with the thing it comes with the sucker of the thing, you know
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:33.080]   What sucker up or see that big thing that's attached to it. Oh, you don't eat it. Oh
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:41.400]   Sounds like a jet engine going off. Yeah, but you only have to do that like once every two months ah
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:50.280]   So basically we just have this vacuum and like our dog sleeps under our bed and you can't vacuum under the bed really
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:54.600]   So like all that hair gets picked up. We vacuum like once or twice a day
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:18:01.480]   Live in the Pacific Northwest our laundry room is just this constant source of like imagine your house the day after Christmas or the
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.240]   Day after you take your Christmas tree out. There's just pine needles and mud everywhere
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:08.520]   It takes care of all of that. Oh, that was a big problem
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:15.680]   They killed our Dyson because it got all the piney needles got all glued together in there. We had to go
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:22.920]   Yeah, really clean it out. So we should we get a new Roomba? I mean I you know, I'm the one who kicked the Roomba out
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:24.440]   I feel bad
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:28.160]   Maybe we should get a room if you have I mean what kind of carpet we have Berber carpet
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:32.520]   So if you have really long hair shaggy, yeah, it's maybe it wouldn't work. Yeah, the bedrooms. Yeah
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.440]   It was really well in the Berbers. Yeah, you need new carpet. Yeah
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:42.440]   Yeah, and I yeah, I thought shag carpet he went out about 1978 Leo. Oh, I got it went out
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:45.160]   I got a little a port house. Yeah, I got it
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.960]   All right
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:54.280]   Okay, apparently the Verge has a review that it doesn't do a great job avoiding poop
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.480]   And I'll tell you why that's a big deal
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.880]   If it doesn't avoid it. Do you really want to share it out problematic? It's just a mess quite problematic
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:09.320]   Yeah, that is a problem. Yeah, so that was also part of your time. We don't have a huge
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:16.240]   Issue with that. I mean that we have cats, but they don't they'll go in the house. So I guess it's okay
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.520]   Are there other better robots than the
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:25.480]   I robot there are plenty of robot. No, it's very competitive
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:30.560]   Feel yeah, like Evacs has a cheap one. Why is even came out with one? Wow?
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:37.920]   I saw the one for wise and when it was sent to the email. I the first thing I thought was well
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.760]   Oh, these two just came in a set of all of them never again. Oh
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:49.280]   I put it under your wheel, but you didn't drive over it. You smart enough to catch it
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:52.120]   What?
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:59.960]   You tried to get her to murder your Roomba the room, but I've told this story haven't I told this story the the Roomba
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:03.660]   We did it we ran it at night and it would
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:10.280]   It would get caught every night it would get caught there's one like
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:15.160]   Side dress side thing sideboard that it was just tiny for the room
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:19.720]   But I kind of get under it but not and then it would go boom boom boom boom
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:24.960]   So every night I'd hear to that because it makes music when it starts
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:34.560]   Loop and yeah, and so I pick it up and I put it back on its little charger and the next night at 3 a.m. Same thing
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:38.440]   So eventually instead of picking up putting on his charger. I picked it up and put it under releases
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.360]   tire, but she
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:47.840]   Sir that's that's just flat out evil. She didn't
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:55.640]   Actually drive over it. I don't think she thinks she did maybe she did. I don't know it disappeared at evil
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:00.960]   Those are expensive to that was looking like a corner on your box. Yeah
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:11.960]   All right, all right, all right, all right
[02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:20.960]   Is there any idea of that tech I just want one of those things actually have legit suction, you know
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:24.920]   Yeah, I agree with these help we prue it about this
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:31.920]   This is the 10 minute robot manicure you put your fingers in I do
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:37.360]   Yeah, sorry, sorry. How do you been replaced?
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:44.480]   Yes, that's a sore subject right there, sir. You have to go to a target in Minnesota, so it's not yet a threat
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.200]   10 minutes for $10
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:53.400]   You pick one of the 25 colors offered you put your fingers in the machine one by one the machine scans the nail
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:58.040]   Paints it starting around the edges working to the center applies two coats at once
[02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:01.880]   And it works
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.060]   Well, you know, it's got two nozzles or something. I don't know what that means
[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:08.760]   It's the world's the
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:11.400]   The benefit of having a queen purr it
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:18.160]   Manicure is you get to see her smiling face and you get tired. Oh you could talk and massage
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:22.520]   I'm gonna say you get to talk to clean prue it what about that very styles and all that stuff
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:28.280]   So yeah, this is from a company called clockwork and it paints your nails right in there. I
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:34.260]   Don't know. It seems like I could do this on a manicure. That's just a nail nail painting nail
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:38.240]   Palms like I could do that it looks like your fingers trapped and you can't go down
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:44.460]   It's pandemic episode of saw mr. Jarvis
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:56.120]   All right, I think I've done the change log. I think we almost killed Stacy
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:01.080]   I think it's time to do the final after get your picks a little bit. I don't think there's much more we can do
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:03.160]   here today
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:08.640]   Are sure today brought to you by new relic if you're a software engineer you've been there 9 p.m
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:15.400]   Midnight maybe you're unwinding you're relaxing maybe even fast asleep then your phone goes off
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:20.360]   There's an alert something's broken and you're going on no. Was it that commit?
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.120]   I pushed right before bed
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:27.040]   It is the server down is the cloud down your mind's already racing what could go wrong?
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:32.720]   Backhand front end global server network cloud provider slow running queries
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:39.440]   You got the whole team scrambling from tool to tool messaging person after person to find and fix the issue you've been through this
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.920]   You know and you know according to new relic only about half of organizations of all organizations in the world are
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:54.280]   Actually trying to do something about this. They're implementing observability is what you call it for the networks and systems which give you a view
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:24:00.240]   Single pane of glass view into your whole operation. So know where the problem is so you could fix it fast
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:06.360]   the report showed maintaining network observability is a big issue for companies around the world and
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:13.360]   If you're epic or github or Atlassian or cloudflare you are turning to new relic
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:19.160]   New relic 16 different monitoring products you probably get separately
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:23.920]   But they're all in one which makes it great because you can just use one stack and
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.160]   Get all the information you need things like application monitoring a p.m
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:34.840]   Unified monitoring for your apps and your microservices or if you use Kubernetes you'll have pixie instant Kubernetes observability
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:38.440]   You get not just tracing but distributed tracing
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:42.800]   You can see all your traces without management headaches. You could find and fix issues fast

[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:14.040]   So, you know exactly why the problem happened you can even fix the code and resolve it for good

[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.200]   Stacey's been so long since we've had your thing of the week. What do you got for us?
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:31.680]   Nothing
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:33.680]   Covid-19
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.680]   I got Covid-19
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.840]   No, no, I was like I have I have many
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:43.360]   What do you don't have to give us a thing?
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:48.960]   But what are some of the things you're looking at you're working on you're preparing for the future
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.160]   That's sorry. I can tell you the stacey
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:59.480]   The thing that I have been recently watching oh, that's good
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:06.520]   Bo Burnham's inside. He just put out the outtakes just a couple days ago, and I really enjoyed those
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:09.040]   Who is Bo Burnham?
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:12.320]   He is a convenience
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.760]   Stacey's side eye there really you know I'm like oh are you are you really asking?
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:23.480]   Wait a minute. This is so he does like play the piano. No, I know he is he does Netflix comedy specials and like that
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.480]   But this video is behind the scenes
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.600]   Yeah
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:30.000]   Yeah
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.480]   So it's it's the out there's a couple outtakes that are funny
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:37.440]   And you know they're all outtakes so they're not
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.840]   Only if you were them are very polished. Have you seen his inside had you seen inside before? Oh
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.760]   My god, yes, so as a person who makes content
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:53.280]   For people on the internet in somewhat of a void because they don't I'm I'm my own person, right?
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.840]   And as someone who is also, you know definitely depressed I
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:01.600]   When I watched inside I was like oh my god this guy is speaking to me
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:08.200]   I mean well normally you hide this my mother always said if somebody's a really good cake a baker
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:11.640]   It's because they put so many cakes in the trash, you know
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:16.720]   They they only show you their best stuffs and normally and I know exactly what you're talking about
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.680]   Stacy you'll watch a talented performer and you think I can't ever do that they're perfect. Yeah
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:26.240]   So you see that and especially in the way. Yeah, yeah
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.280]   I mean I feel like a lot of us probably could identify with this and you think about like Anthony Bourdain you think about Kate Spade
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:40.080]   There's a huge number of highly successful on the outside people who I think experience a lot of self doubt as part of their creative process
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:42.840]   and it wears on them so I
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:49.440]   Like the parts where he's kind of you see him trying to struggle to make something it felt real
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.360]   So and he did start on YouTube. So I mean he's kind of you know, he's familiar with this
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:29:00.160]   Yeah, he started on YouTube way back at the beginning. It's one of the first viral YouTube people in 2006
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:05.680]   So you probably would say watch the Netflix special first inside
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:06.240]   Oh, yeah
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:10.560]   Yeah, if you haven't watched that I mean I feel like if you haven't watched the Netflix special
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.560]   It's it's excellent for anybody who spends a lot of time on the internet
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:22.480]   So and then it's it's pretty I gotta I gotta watch this. I tried to watch. Have you never seen it? No, I tried
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:30.080]   You should check it out. You know why? Yeah, well, he did all of this himself in the lighting and the camera work is
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:37.520]   Also, like really creative like you'll and he did it all himself. It's not it's not a stand-up special inside
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:42.720]   No, it's what I didn't realize you hadn't seen it. You never heard of it even no, I hadn't seen it
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:45.920]   It could have recommended it to me, but I hadn't watched it yet. Yeah, I mean
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:48.560]   I think it's really that flips
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:53.040]   Recommended it to me. I tried to watch Ricky Gervais last night and it was awful
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:30:00.400]   No, go watch inside your watch awful. I love Ricky Gervais. I love the office, but I'm sorry. I don't love him anymore. What a jerk
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:08.160]   Okay, so good. So I need something to watch something come it's it's comedy though, right? I'm I'm not
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:10.960]   It's it's hilarious here if you do um
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:14.720]   Google welcome to the internet. It's a funny mr. Jarvis
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.720]   I have it. I have a right here. Do the youtube version of welcome to the internet. Well, I just have the whole this is the Netflix
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:26.160]   I mean, I won't play it, you know, oh no do it do the polished bit just like this is the polished. Oh, yeah
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:31.440]   This is it. This is both rims. I'll just jump to just so we can see the lighting. Oh, so he's in his house
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:35.040]   He's playing songs. He's doing what a youtuber does
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:43.200]   Yeah, is it is it funny or is it music? What is it? It is both it is all of the about oh see that was welcome to the internet right there
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.320]   Yeah
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:49.520]   Okay, so watch this. This is 4k and high quality and polished and all that stuff for a couple of hours
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:52.320]   But then watch the outtakes
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:55.840]   Because then you'll see that he goes through the same struggles
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:58.800]   We all do except he has an air conditioner. So
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.600]   He does have an air conditioner. Yeah. Yeah, so that's maybe maybe one little difference
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:08.160]   Um, wow, he so this is interest. It sounds like he's very creative
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:14.240]   Very talented tons of creative people on the internet. This is amazing. We can see them. There are yeah
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:19.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, and this guy is probably not a guy who would have gotten a network television special
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:25.120]   Uh, no, he went viral and he actually talks about that on the thing. I'm sorry. I'm just jumping all over you and my enthusiasm
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.520]   All over me, baby. It's fine. Oh
[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:32.560]   You call her baby. No, I didn't mean that I just
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:41.200]   Okay, my friend. Oh no, I just meant it's okay. I would have said that to anybody. It's okay if you're gonna
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.840]   I believe it. That's exactly how I reacted
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:47.600]   I don't mean literally real lessons
[02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:52.560]   It's not lame and she's not a baby
[02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:55.520]   Certainly not friend
[02:31:55.520 --> 02:31:57.920]   Jump all over me friend. That's no better
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:04.160]   Jump all over me. I don't mind if you jump in please. I appreciate your enthusiasm. They're there yet. Yeah, okay
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.880]   All right, someone else goes so we can get out and die
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.400]   Like this awkward
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:13.200]   Jeff baby. You got a number for me
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.120]   Well, honey
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:17.120]   Um, sweetie cookie
[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:19.520]   I'm gonna do this one. So
[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:21.360]   one of my
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:25.840]   Contensions in defending the internet and trying to explain where it fits in the world is that
[02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:28.480]   each new medium
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:32.400]   Since print. Yes, I'm a Gutenberg moment. Take your gulp
[02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:39.600]   Um when it brings more people into the public conversation those who controlled it before resent it and resist
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:42.640]   The reformation meets the counter reformation
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:49.840]   Um and and and what's happened on the internet these days is that people who were not at the table to set norms and decisions and power
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:53.760]   Are now there and it peeps the people who were there
[02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:57.920]   But we've got to not lose sight of this magnificent
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:01.520]   Diversity of creators and talent that we see coming on
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:04.880]   So there were three stories that just came out of absolutely out of everywhere else
[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:08.800]   But I put them together in one place because I thought they were they spoke to this
[02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:12.000]   One is about the people at the center of black twitter
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:19.120]   One is about tick tock honoring the class of 22 lgpt q trailblazers
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:23.680]   Another one is the la times talking about the old guys tick tock
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:28.240]   And how they become incredibly popular and it just reminds us
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:36.800]   That this is the value of the net of social media of creation there is the voices who were not heard in mainstream mass media
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:40.000]   Run by old white men like look like me, but they're less pink
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.680]   Um
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:47.440]   And and we get that value out of them now. So if you look at the at the the people on black twitter
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:51.040]   I'm completely lost here. So every time you do this
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:56.240]   You always have a bunch of links and i'm listening and trying to figure out which of the links is he going to
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:01.680]   But I don't i'm not i'm seeing pittany bows amazon stats
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:08.640]   You know my scummer biggest my early earth and how much companies pay this has nothing nor
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:15.360]   I tried to I did a tease earlier. I wanted to do celebrating identity other than it's there in green at line 40
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.640]   Blind 40 way up there
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:24.000]   I went back because you let me do my story that I wanted to do because it's not a democracy after all
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:31.280]   Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Did you um, so okay. Let's do it now. That's fine. And we'll save. I'm doing we'll save pittany
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:33.520]   Post for another day
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:39.040]   Um, yeah, the pittany boestroy was boring as cold as hell. Yeah, which which one should I say you want to do?
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:43.600]   I'm 40 more than people at the center of black twitter black twitter, right?
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:48.000]   It's a great list now some of this is stuff that they don't want me watching
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.000]   They want to do what they want to subscribe to a lot of these people. I actually asked lovey
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.880]   I said who should I follow years ago?
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.480]   Uh on twitter and she gave me a whole bunch and a lot of these people although it's always growing which is fun
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:05.440]   It is it's great and I I follow a lot too, but I added a few more today
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:11.280]   This is this is a good list. So these are some I'm not welcome to join in on they're having a conversation among themselves
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:13.840]   And that's well you don't have to say anything. Can you can you listen?
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:19.920]   Yeah, of course you can but some of it's not meant for me. It's it's it's you know, I always this is a moment when I always
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:23.600]   Praise the book uh distributed blackness by on re brock jr
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:28.640]   Which I highly recommend and black software by charlotte mackellwein about this
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.680]   Creating a space for a community online what you can do you don't have to be mass you don't have to talk to everybody
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:36.800]   You can talk among yourselves and that's the beauty of the net
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:40.800]   So a lot of these people don't have a huge number of followers
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.320]   Raven only has 4,000 followers
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:47.120]   Uh, you know, that's great
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:52.720]   Uh before the steam powered printing press the average circulation of a daily newspaper in the United States was 4,000
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.920]   And it was big enough to be a newspaper then big enough now. Yeah, I think yeah, absolutely
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:00.000]   I don't judge somebody by the number of followers they have
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.960]   Um, so then next we have teen vogue
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:12.000]   Uh with the lgbtq has become very much a political force in this world. Absolutely. Absolutely. So the lgbtq trailblazers on tick tock
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.680]   Um
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:16.320]   And we don't have to go through these particularly, but it's just just making the point again
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.480]   But then I would go to the next story of the la times
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.960]   About the old guys and there's one video in there because it's really charming
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:26.240]   It's always pride on old gaze tick tock
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:33.040]   So these four guys are on tick tock all the time they come across my feet regularly and there's one video sample of them in there
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.120]   They're great. This one with Rihanna the music from Rihanna. Yeah, the Rihanna one. Yeah. Yeah
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:41.440]   Really? Oh, you're kidding. Oh my god
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.960]   Really? She's she's the queen
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:47.360]   She's one of me
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:52.240]   A beautiful talent and look how Rihanna had good taste my
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:37:00.000]   Thank you. Well, I would such a beautiful talented woman of Rihanna be watching us
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000]   Very entertaining. Aren't we?
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.880]   I mean
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:07.440]   That's that's great. It's just oh
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:10.400]   And do y'all know her nickname? No
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:13.520]   No, no, no, no, ree-vee
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:16.080]   What?
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.960]   So they obviously have somebody
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:21.680]   Everybody's parents. We we
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:25.920]   So, um
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:32.000]   There's obviously somebody egging them on and so what I get from this really is there's a kind of younger guy behind this
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.360]   A lot. I gotta go. No, no, there's not they do their own thing. I mean, yeah, they do
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:40.080]   There might be younger people involved, but they have their own like
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:42.960]   Anyway, nice
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:48.080]   You want to see 19 million views on tick tock here. Oh, jeez
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.320]   Maybe I'll stop now. How about that?
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:57.040]   They're dressed in bunny suits. It's not playing for some reason. Here we go. Let's try it again
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:06.480]   Oh, they're dancing to Michael Jackson
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:14.160]   What that's a lot of views
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:19.600]   For four guys in the bunny ears and and and sequin blue sequin shorts
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.360]   There the same thing is called bless the just a curiosity
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:26.880]   Themselves these guys my age is that a curiosity?
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.880]   I think they're probably the only time story hold there
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:37.840]   Probably see if you see a number. Oh my god. They're older than that. I hope they are praise the lord. I hope they are
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:40.400]   They don't I don't I don't think they uh
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:43.040]   Oh wait a minute
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.960]   a canny director slash stylist slash social media manager
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.280]   A 35 year old named ryan's push for tick tock was driven for it
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:59.040]   But I desire to give people at behind the scenes look at the old gaze. So yes, I was right. There is a 35 year old
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:06.720]   Media guy who said oh, I got a handler a handler. Did you see the the holocaust survivor who just came out with a book
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.880]   Her grandson or great grandson
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.840]   Interviewed her regularly on tick tock and then he just came out with a book and it made the new york times bestseller list
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:16.640]   Wow, this is what's happening on tick tock school. She's 90
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:21.920]   Like two of the guys are older than me. There's two 78 year olds one guy's my much
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:24.640]   and the other ones a couple of years older so
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:31.120]   You go ahead there. I hate them. What do you suit? I try to get attention before you. Uh, thank you, honey
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:35.760]   All right, let's move on to aunt pruit and his picture theory
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:42.000]   Okay, my picks are um because I didn't do too much research
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:48.880]   But I did know about cannons new r7 and r10 cameras. Uh the r10 is an apse
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:55.600]   mirrorless camera where they're basically just just saying you know what all of those dslrs are dead
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:02.720]   So we're trying to bring people into the mirrorless world but with a smaller their budgets a smaller sensor and a smaller price
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:09.440]   Yeah thousand bucks not bad. So this one is a thousand bucks. Uh, then they have the r7 which replaces the
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:16.560]   This is the one henry once. Yeah, no, no, no, this is this is replacing the old 7d. Oh, which was another apse
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:20.640]   Also, yes lr. Okay. Good. So but it was a little bit more expensive
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:25.760]   This one is about 15 hundred because you're gonna get um 4k 60 frames a second over sample
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:29.120]   32 megabyte megapixels sensor
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:33.440]   So it's got a little bit more beefier specs, but it's still a smaller sensor
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.880]   It's not a four frame sensor where there's nothing wrong with an apse sensor
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.480]   Just depends on what you're trying to what you want to look that look like
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:44.800]   But yeah, they announced those last week and uh you can pre-order them
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:48.880]   Whenever you want to you're probably aunt too young to remember
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:52.880]   A film camera the olympus om-1. Do you remember that?
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.240]   It was i've seen the lore
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:02.240]   It's a it was a classic actually you could still you know buy them on ebay and uh and amazon. They were beautiful
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:04.320]   Here's one for $252
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:08.400]   Uh classic. I loved them. This was my I think one of my first
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:13.840]   35 millimeter cameras. I think I had that too. Yeah. Oh, it was a clay. We have in this Rebecca 70s
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:22.000]   I think yeah, yeah, then the nikon my grandmother had that I broke looked like that. Yeah, it was an old film. Is that how you say it?
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:29.600]   Yes nikon most people say I had no idea. I did. Yes. I'm like, oh my gosh. I've been saying it wrong my whole life
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.320]   Thank you. Yeah, sorry. No no judgment. It's it's all right, but I've been around him
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.320]   Enough and they always said nikon nikon
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:41.280]   Yeah, that it makes sense my grandmother had looked like that and that I broke
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:46.880]   That's the one it really got me into tinkerin with stuff because I broke it and didn't want her to know I broke it
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:51.520]   So it's it's the 50th anniversary of the original
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:54.240]   uh om-1 film camera and
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:42:00.720]   I think this is kind of a nice tribute the folks, you know olympus. Oh a DP review. Yeah olympus sold
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:06.640]   uh the om series their micro four thirds series to a company called om system
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:12.240]   And they've released their first one on the anniversary of the olympus om-1 and they're calling it
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:18.000]   Then om- om-1. Oh, the last one with olympus, but of course it's digital with a it's a micro four thirds
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.760]   I
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:21.600]   Lisa loved her old olympus
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.160]   Uh
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:30.960]   A m ft cameras. We have a lot of those lenses. So as did mr. Scott born. Yep. Yes
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.800]   He was a big fan. I think he still is because he said my
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:40.560]   He still likes him. Yeah, my hand was getting heavy on the big heavy cameras and these are really amazing cameras
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:44.480]   So they just released this I thought I'd get a frillie sif before the cruise. So don't tell her but
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:45.920]   um
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:51.440]   It just it just came out and uh, I think it's quite a beautiful camera but we'll do a review that way I can write it off
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:56.000]   So there you go. There you go. No, we will do a review because I know there are people interested
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:59.600]   You know who else Andy and I go loves it did scoporn stop shooting olympus?
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.240]   Um
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:06.080]   To an extent because he's doing more video now. So we went to um
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.160]   So he had to pick up the saunee fs f x six
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:14.400]   Right he was doing video with that, but he's also a big proponent of iphone video
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:21.760]   So um he and mr. jephes and graham are doing more with iphones and video interesting and started a new show on that and
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.560]   Interesting. He's done a lot of good stuff with it. So uh, this does pretty good video too. Actually
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:30.640]   He might be interested in the improve the video a lot. They stack the sensor and and all that
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:38.320]   Ants pictures are as we mentioned earlier on instagram and underscore broot and tick tock you follow dare
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:43.120]   Give me a follow dare folks. I am underscore pro. And if you check out that last reel
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:47.360]   I did we talked about lighting in that last reel. I just did a little bit of behind the scene
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:50.880]   So on coffee how I created a shot because I was uh
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:54.080]   struggling create creatively and
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:59.920]   Went out to my to my garage slash lab and threw some lights up and figured out a way to nice
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:02.080]   Put a little shot together fun
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:03.360]   There's a uh
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:09.120]   Key light right there over the top and then I put another light in the back corner to give it a little bit of a sun ray
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:16.400]   And then just grabbed my cinema camera and just shot some random footage very nice because I have no life
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:22.880]   No, there's a few look at this. Oh, man. The last shot the last image was so gorgeous. I guess that's
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:28.240]   Oh, well, you just have to follow photos. Is it in the photos? Oh, okay good
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:33.920]   I'll go back to the post back in the post. Yeah, such a gorgeous shot. Look at that
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:36.640]   Thank you. Yeah, and of course

[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.240]   I'm struggling with this book right now because I've been in such a foul mood. Yeah, it doesn't help your mood doesn't
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:08.240]   Yeah, that's not a climate change
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:13.760]   Um, I'm not I'm only uh about a third of the way through termination shot by Neil Stevenson
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:18.240]   He's one of my favorite authors. Do you know it sounds like you don't like it either Stacy? I'm sorry. It's your book club
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.480]   I didn't I didn't enjoy the book, but everyone was like, let's watch. I was like, okay fine. Neil
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:28.800]   Stevenson needs an editor. Yeah, you know, I like about him and I really enjoy about this book is his
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:33.840]   Research his air audition. So you always learn a lot about the most
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.800]   Yeah, you know what the better climate change novel is ministry of the future by Kim Stanley Robinson
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:42.720]   But both of these books have a plot problem
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:46.640]   Yes, they're just boring ass plots
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:52.160]   Yeah, near as famous also for poor endings and john tells me that the book doesn't have the best ending either
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:54.560]   No, yeah, that's terrible
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:56.960]   Oh, this will be a great book club coming up

[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:38.080]   Oh, no, it was actually a really good event up until getting covid. Um, I enjoyed it was a smart home event held by parks associates
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:39.200]   So
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:45.120]   It was good for a bunch of reasons the the number one reason was I got to see like all the people from the
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:50.000]   smart home industry and pass them covid and I got to
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:55.440]   like have this event with parks and I had a weird history because um
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:01.760]   They kicked me out of one of their shows a couple of years back. So it was my first time back with them
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:04.720]   kicked you out
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:06.720]   They kicked me out because I
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:14.720]   Kept noting that every panel was really a manel and I found that upsetting and frustrating and they were like, oh, I remember this
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:18.560]   I remember this you were tweeting about it, right?
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:21.360]   Yeah, I was I was niffed
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:23.520]   but respect
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:29.200]   Respect they had women this time. Good. See and it wasn't just me. Yeah, so I was like
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:33.680]   I got to give them credit. They brought me back and they were like, all right. We got we got women
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:39.440]   I totally remember that that was a that was a big furor and I was proud of it was an infer
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:42.160]   Fure it was just it was a twitter for surprising
