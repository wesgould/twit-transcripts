[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Matt Kotsie is too from Google and we're gonna talk about all sorts of things
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.400]   Including I think a very interesting conversation about Larry Page's motivations. Why does he do what he does?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400]   We'll talk about it next on Twig

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.520]   Journalism whatever anybody wants to talk about because when you have a panel as good as we have on this show you just let them go
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.640]   Partly that's Jeff Jarvis's fault. I blame you professor Jarvis
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.960]   City University New York hey hey hey
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   Buzz machine dot com is his blog that's getting an intelligent conversation a hey
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.960]   There actually is I want to talk about journalism, but we'll do that in a little bit
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.320]   And I'm so glad to have from the from alphabet comm ABC dot XYZ no
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   cuts
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.960]   Hello can I say again can I say formerly of Google yet?
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.600]   No, no, I'm still at Google on leave on leave from Google and it you're on leave from Google not alphabet am I right?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.520]   That's right Google is the search part alphabet is not the search part right everything but
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.960]   That makes sense since since Jeff we should say Matt cuts is always welcome here. We love Matt
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   He does not speak for Google, but he has was an early Google employee for a long time
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.800]   Did two things of great import one is keep the spam out of Google search results?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.000]   That was his day job and by night he did the great webmaster videos of webmaster tools
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.680]   They've changed those a little bit haven't they since you're since you're leave
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.120]   They've changed them a little bit, but they're still doing some pretty neat stuff for example
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   They've been working on something called
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.840]   Hashtag no hacked or something like that to help webmasters make sure that their site is secure
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.480]   And you know they're not reusing passwords and stuff like that
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   So there's there's actually some some great new stuff that they've just pushed out recently nice. That's great
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.200]   So I went I was a VidCon
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   I met some of the guys who handle that channel on YouTube. I said oh, yeah, I'm on you know
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.680]   I'm on the twig really with Matt cuts was like it was like I said vigor
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   Oh
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   They love you they love the mat
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.720]   Who doesn't everybody loves Matt cuts?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.280]   I was shocked that you weren't made CEO, but that's I mentioned you today teaching our whole new class in fact that
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   What do you think you know we talked a lot obsessively last week about alphabet because that had just happened on Monday?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.480]   But I'm curious what you think as a somebody who works at Google
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.720]   And knows Larry of course well tell us what why what's going on?
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.080]   Well, I'll preface it again with this is just my personal take but you know Larry is
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.480]   Fantastic at seeing five-year trends, you know and that's the sort of stuff that he's interested in you know moon shots big bets
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.200]   You know he doesn't just want to come in and and you know
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.920]   Necessarily cross the T's and dot the I's and so I think this new structure is kind of nice because alphabet
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.600]   You know can concentrate on some of those moonshots and yet soon dar at the same time be by becoming CEO of Google is
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.360]   Recognized and is able to you know help make sure the things work well employees are happy
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.000]   You know we can work on you know all kinds of stuff all the way down to the nitty-gritty details like diversity or inclusiveness stuff like that
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.280]   And so that hopefully you get the best of both worlds you get Larry able to think about how do we you know reinvent cities?
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.320]   And you also get soon dar who is able to you know work at that level
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.760]   But is also happy to go down to the micro level details as well. That's my hope at least
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.120]   We'll see how it works out over time. Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense in that light soon dar's a great choice
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.800]   Right. I mean he's he's been just a super star for the last few years
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.600]   Yeah, he's fantastic
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.920]   And especially from you know his DNA of you know coming up from the chrome world
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.400]   I have a lot of faith that you know the open federated, you know
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Decentralized web he understands the importance of all of those things and
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.560]   Whenever I've had any experiences with soon dar, you know whenever there's been some problem or some feedback
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.000]   He's always taking it very seriously and so that gives me a lot of confidence
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.560]   You know that he's gonna keep trying to do the right thing and hopefully represent those old school Google values
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.200]   You know even as Google tackles whatever the next big set of challenges. Yeah, that's great to hear
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.400]   Yeah, and you know
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.760]   Making Sundar CEO is really one way of saying its business as usual. I
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.400]   Mean it's not like you brought in Carly Fiorina
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.120]   Yeah, I mean things are are going pretty well at Google overall
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   And it was funny because I did a 12 mile run this this weekend
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   And I listened to this week in Google the whole way, you know because you had a long show
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.160]   And I was nodding and laughing along. I was like, yeah, okay
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.200]   They get it, you know and and it's kind of funny because I think last week Leo
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.760]   You said well, this is Larry's chance to retire and I don't think Larry wants to retire
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.920]   But it might be indistinguishable from working on the big things that are fun to you that you don't have to do
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.600]   Versus retirement and so I don't I definitely hadn't thought of it in that sense
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.640]   I don't think of it as a retirement at all but it does free him up
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.120]   So he doesn't have to go in and go to the weekly meeting about whatever subject he doesn't care about
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.280]   And if he's excited to tackle the next big challenge, then that's good for everybody and hopefully good for society as well
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.760]   That's what I would say. I mean if there are two people you want to have
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Have plenty of resources and plenty of time to focus on challenges. It'd be Larry and Sergey
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.240]   I'm thrilled and Sundar is
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.280]   Exactly the guy you would want to put in position for day-to-day operations. I think this is this it's all works very well
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.520]   Ruth poor out of is great as well
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.400]   I think you've got a good hell of a good team and it does make me think that this has probably been in the works for some time
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.320]   No comment
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:46.760]   Know how to use silence as a tool silence can speak volumes. All right, let's talk about some new stuff from Google
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.480]   You know, we'll talk about projects on roof. We'll talk about Google curing disease
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.840]   We'll talk about hangouts and its own site, but I gotta say the thing that most excites me is this new Wi-Fi router
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.400]   Yeah
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.040]   Immediately got on in order to one it was sold out for me at Google had order for Walmart
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   When is this when is Walmart say you're gonna? It's interesting because Google didn't make this available everywhere including Amazon
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.240]   It's called on hub
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240]   and
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.400]   I can't think of a more unlikely sudden announcement from Google. Yeah, the $200 Wi-Fi router and
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.680]   yet
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.880]   When you read the specs you realize oh
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.720]   This is the first AC router to really use some of these features of AC and of course hidden in here is the key
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.800]   which is it supports we've and
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.200]   That is the that is the mesh network that I think is gonna be very important to the Google home automation
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.680]   play
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.560]   So I'm surprised though. It was that it's not not like from nest it feels like this should be a nest
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.320]   Product, but maybe it is I don't know
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:07.660]   Smooth I don't think it's nest now, but yeah, it's that's one of those things where they'll have to figure out the right branding
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.680]   But my favorite feature is that it has a baker's dozen of antennas
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.040]   So literally can you believe in different in 13 antennas? So yeah, there's
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   Go ahead
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:24.720]   What I well there's just the neat thing to me is normally when you have a Wi-Fi router it reboots
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.080]   It picks the channel that's the least congested and then it stays with that channel until it reboots again
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.140]   Right and that 13th that extra antenna
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.720]   Let's you scan and every five minutes if it finds a channel that's less congested
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.440]   It will switch to that channel without you having to do anything
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:48.160]   Not so it's always going to be looking for the most capacious channel to use for Wi-Fi gigabit ethernet port on it one-wann one land
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   It's got a USB 3 port on it, which is kind of intriguing
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.520]   When they've got the speaker built in I don't know why you have a speaker in a router
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.800]   I'm sure we'll find out and an ambient light ring in fact
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.000]   What what consumer electronic device has a speaker and an ambient light ring and kind of looks like this the echo I?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.160]   Got a wonder there was there was a story about the echo, but but it doesn't seem to have any functionality
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.480]   That's anything close to the echo currently. There's a lot of when you read the specs. There's a lot of no a
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.600]   Lot of ready, you know, it's weave ready. It's 802.15.4 ready
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.120]   It's Bluetooth smart ready kind of feeling what I really get the feeling is that this is something ready for the future
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.360]   You use it to you could figure it with an app on your Android or iOS
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   device I
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:50.200]   Just I feel like there's there's a lot here by the way enjoy it with your Chromecast NES cam nest learning thermostat and your Nexus 6
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   Okay, I'll enjoy it with all of those
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.720]   Devices I just feel like there's more to this we haven't
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:04.560]   It's dual core 1.4 gigahertz processor. You don't normally in commodity devices like routers put fast processors
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.280]   There's something going on with this one and and it's got
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.280]   There's a lot of flash, you know four gigabytes of flash
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.080]   memory and
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.200]   So it does feel like it's ready to be really not just a great router today
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.440]   But a great router tomorrow and next year. I will just say though
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.040]   I think it's only intended to be a router for the for example the speaker is three watts
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.960]   So you're not gonna get, you know, a lot of it's just a be you amount of that
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.280]   But for example, maybe it could well
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.180]   Yeah, maybe it or maybe it could send out some signals that another device could hear and then use that
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   Oh
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.480]   So one problem is that it's set up to be to be in your room and they made it cylindrical
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.760]   So you wouldn't put things on top of it and it's but to be out there
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.040]   But of course everybody's connection is some in some closet somewhere right behind me is my closet
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:03.440]   Yeah, but you they want they say hiding a router weakens its signal on hubs tidy cords and tucked away antennas
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.880]   Mean you can leave it out in the open for the best possible coverage. It is a challenge
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.040]   I have an air it's gonna replace my airport express similarly expensive
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.920]   and kind of
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.400]   Attractive enough to leave out in the living room, but this will look a lot better
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.720]   I'm a little worried though because I use
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:28.320]   I use other airports to extend it throughout the house. I'm worried about that too. I'm not sure exactly how this is gonna
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.680]   Work, but I'll give you I'll give you a way. I look at it is
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.920]   Googlers have big houses
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   That's right
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.560]   This is not made for people with small walk-ups flats my friends
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.680]   No, I know I think that's true
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.640]   But it's probably also true that you know if I wouldn't be surprised if you could have
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.480]   Multiple ones of these devices and have them work pretty well together, you know, that seems like a pretty I might buy another one
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.760]   I almost bought to just on the presumption that Google would do that both both of them hardwired to the ethernet
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   No one is a repeater you could use one as a repeat. Yeah
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Yeah, yeah, you could I think you could you could do it that way
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.840]   Jeff you could do it connected to ethernet on both and then they could we talk to each other at this
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.360]   I've never seen this it says limit reached it doesn't say sold out
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   It says limit reached
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   I said out of stock when I went there. Yeah limit reached. I
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.920]   Don't know. I'm not sure exactly what that means
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.300]   Comes in blue and black. I've course ordered blue because well if they're gonna make it blue
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   I might as well make it buy a blue one
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:47.800]   So I did order it I don't know when when I'll get it they did all you think it will do Leo in the next year
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.600]   What what are the what are the one of the one interested it has so many antennas?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.680]   I'm wondering if it does AC beam forming which is one of the things that's very cool about 802.11 AC that
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.760]   Very few routers do which is aim
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.120]   AC has built in this capability to kind of aim at hooked up devices to beam form
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.800]   Target the beam and then as a result have a better
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   performance this 802 and they do
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.080]   Go ahead Matt
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.760]   Sorry, they do talk about that
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:29.400]   Dude they do talk about the fact that you can designate one device like a Wi-Fi device and say I want the best quality of service for this device
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.280]   Right and so that would be kind of nice because if you're surfing on an iPad or whatever
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   You really want to prioritize that and not you know a firmware or you're relit
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   Reloading all your apps on some phone that you're not using so it's easy to provide an even stronger signal a front-facing antenna
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:53.760]   But that doesn't necessarily mean beam forming then I was curious about this says 802.12.5 ready
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.800]   I thought what is that?
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.640]   It's a standard I looked it up because I'd never heard of it remember 802.11 is
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.600]   What we're using for Wi-Fi 802.15.4
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:14.720]   specifies the Matt you're gonna have to explain this the physical layer and media access control for low rate
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.960]   Wireless personal area networks. It's a pan
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   Ah
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   Zigbee uses it
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.960]   This is a home automation spec
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:36.240]   It can be used with six low W pan and standard internet protocols to build a wireless embedded internet. I think that's probably part of weave
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:45.320]   And I would guess that it's for home automation or possibly Brillo and Brillo was last relief, right? Yeah, yeah
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:53.120]   Yeah, yeah, so it's kind of nice because it is designed to be pretty future-proofed as far as I can tell I know I was really blown away
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.400]   It seems to me something I just you know, I bought on faith basically
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   It's like you get in yours
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.480]   That's a good question
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.040]   I thought I should look at take it away from my screen for a second
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   I'm gonna check my email because I thought I got an email that said it's on its way
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.640]   But they said it wouldn't be for a while, right?
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.760]   Yeah, I think mine mine says September 1 I think that's pretty quick. You got yours at Walmart, which is bizarre
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.280]   very
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.360]   Well, it's it sounds like it sold out at the Google Store in like less than half an hour
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.920]   And then I was checking it sold out at Amazon new egg and fries
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.120]   So why did mine arrives August 21 Friday? I also like oh
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.920]   Yeah, nice. Oh great
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.240]   Well, and it also sounds like it's got a TPM, which is a trusted platform module
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:51.360]   So for example with Chromebooks, there's a signed a BIOS so that when you boot you're sort of guaranteed that some malware or virus
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.880]   Hasn't taken over your BIOS because it's cryptographically signed isn't that awesome?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.160]   So, you know, you want that same level of security from your router as well
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   Yeah, and and you
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.880]   I mean we're used to routers having to reboot whenever you make a change
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.160]   And so it's designed to not have to reboot whenever you make a change as well
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   So mine says aug October 1st through 5th. What?
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.560]   I'm I'm arrives by Friday August 21 and I'm
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.760]   Friday August 21 August 21 is three days from now
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.920]   I know well you're gonna have to tell us what to think we need a review from you well
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.320]   Jakes not have because Jake's basically the this isn't been here. He's not happy. I believe or not
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.680]   What because it means it means this is what you know what it is the family comes to him and says you do this
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.320]   Yeah, we need you to do this and then it's it's like volunteer work, right?
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:44.640]   So I I I said I usually when gadgets come out I email them and I say oh you see this excitedly to get back and said
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.360]   It's not broke. Don't fix it. We have any problems five years
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.960]   Well, no, that's true, but our Wi-Fi drops a lot
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.800]   We have lots of issues
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   And I think it's been the router. So I'm just I'm very hopeful that a router do you have now the high-end Apple Airport?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.360]   Express or an extreme I should say and it's a it's the router. I generally recommend
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   I mean it's almost the same expense as this I'm very intrigued by all of this. I feel like they they this is
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   as
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.040]   Often is the case with Google. This is not a product they intend to
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.280]   Make a business out of this is pointing the way to what a router should be
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.320]   Zemic zet makes sense Matt that that's kind of
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.600]   Cuz they're I mean there's no business here. They already ran out of them
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.240]   Well, I think there can be a good business here
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.480]   The the thing to bear in mind is one way to understand how Google thinks about things is we're trying to make it easier for people
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.360]   To get on on the net and that can be Chrome, which is a bit on the web that can be at Android
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.400]   Which is a bit on apps it can be Google fiber, which is making it, you know
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   Easier to get connectivity and all of that stuff just kicks the you know
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.560]   Goose is the competition a little bit and makes the market more competitive
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:02.800]   So that's good for absolutely everybody and I think you know routers can be so much better
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.600]   So I absolutely hope that it's a huge hit
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.760]   I hope that Google makes money in TP link
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.400]   Which is the partner that Google did with on this on for the hardware makes a lot of money as well
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.920]   But even more I hope that just routers in general realize hey you can raise the bar a lot more
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.080]   Wasn't another version coming from aces I think oh
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.720]   See that somewhere oh
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.240]   I think I saw that somewhere. Yeah, yeah
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.400]   What do you write now what I love about it is that they took something that that nobody likes that doesn't really work
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.040]   That has no glory and said this could be better this essentially a commodity product right now
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.960]   That's it is but it will I imagine this why I would think this gets supplied with Google fiber
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.280]   Interesting maybe that's why they have it
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:50.200]   Yeah, you know think about Gmail right you know mail was thought of as a commodity product before Gmail came in with lots more storage and threaded
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.240]   Conversation so I think over and over again if we can find something that we think is a better way to to do it
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.480]   Then you know it's it's on the table
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.080]   So and Jeff what you're saying about fiber that actually makes a lot of sense because from what I read
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.200]   This was developed by the Chrome team and the team behind fiber
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.800]   In conjunction so maybe this is what they were giving people and now they said hey we really should probably make this a
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.840]   Does good, you know so Matt clarify for me?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.520]   This hardware business is kind of new for Google although they've always made this stuff you see this is
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.440]   How does this fit into Google's?
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.080]   game plan I
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.360]   Think this goes back to the Google alphabet split
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.800]   You know Google people think about as a search company
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.400]   Organize the world's information make it universally accessible and useful and that's a great, you know
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:47.120]   That's ambitious enough for a very large number of people to work on but Larry's ambitions are not limited to just information
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.720]   You know he's interested in energy. He's interested in transportation
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:56.000]   He's interested in all kinds of different topics and so alphabet I think you know there was an article in the rundown about how
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.920]   Life Sciences has been split out into alphabet as well and so
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.000]   You know whether it be hardware hardware is a great lens because if you can do commodity hardware
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.320]   You can really think about project. All right
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.920]   You know the ability to have accelerometers and all of these components driven down by the prices of commodity phones means now
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:22.200]   You can do all kinds of crazy weird new, you know hardware related things simply because you're writing the curve that the phones are on
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.800]   And so I think for a long time Google might have been reluctant to get into hardware because you know
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   It's difficult to do and you know we did the Google search appliance and stuff, you know more than a decade ago
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.640]   But I at some point you have to say look if you want to affect change
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:44.400]   Maybe you're working with partners. Maybe you're doing it on your own, but hardware is a great way to start to take a step in that direction
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.120]   So what devices do you wish Google would tackle next?
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.320]   Well, I'll just say I posted on internal Google Plus
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.760]   You know the one that we use within the company recently and I was like man I left my printer
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:06.680]   You know in this other place and is there a good fax printer scanner all in one that you can use cloud print and can just be on
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.160]   Computer-attached
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.400]   Man, that's hugely annoying right in the computer goes to sleep
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.880]   You can't print anything even over cloud print so to be clear
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.720]   I don't think the Google has building anything like that and I love the I think it was epsin just announced that they have like
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.920]   Tanks of ink that will last for four or five years. I think that's fantastic
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:33.480]   Yeah, but like man if you think about the peripherals that are attached to a computer printers and scanners and facts and all that stuff
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   It's still pretty annoying at this point
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:42.520]   Yeah, I have a I have a Google print and by the way mine when it's the only problem is the printer when it goes off when it goes to sleep
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   I have to turn the thing off entirely to wake it up to get it a print again. However
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.080]   Printer's print jobs queue up
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   On Google print yeah for me right on the cloud not even on your computer on the cloud, which is awesome
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.840]   Oh Google prints fantastic. So the chatroom has told me that the
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.600]   Router is made by TP link, which is a Chinese
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.760]   Manufacturer and in fact if you go to their website it says meet on hub
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.000]   They're not hiding it and they make a bunch of other stuff other routers
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.080]   Here's a their archer tri-band router a wireless dual-band gigabit router the AC 1900
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.760]   So I'm wondering this is interesting. I feel and here's a Wi-Fi extender
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:31.520]   I'm wondering if this extender would work with the on hub get to buy more. I'm gonna buy more and just see
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.120]   So one thing I saw did I see?
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.040]   Jason on one of the stories in the rundown says something that's so speculation that Google wants to throw some love
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:44.520]   China's way on one of the new next eyes the speculation and this always being also being Chinese as
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.240]   They done stuff with China Chinese hardware companies before am I crazy?
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.040]   I am it are you talking about the the Huawei Nexus potentially yes. Yeah, I mean
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.800]   Well, they've used a my memory. I can't remember
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.560]   They use a they've used a sis before well. Yeah, that's true with the Nexus 7 right? It's Taiwan
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.920]   Total Leo Leo you're about to get bomb. That's not China. It's not China. No, it's not China
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   It's not China
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.840]   But no, I mean the you know the the rumor mill if the rumor mill can ever be trusted
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:25.000]   Has LG coming out with an excess five ish phone and the Huawei coming out with an excess six ish phone
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.360]   So that would definitely be a first as far as I can remember
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:37.040]   As far as that's concerned particularly with with the company like Huawei, which I feel like kind of flies under the radar in the US
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.800]   By a large stream memes. I'm waiting for I've seen the first beam. I've already seen of course is yeah
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.760]   Just why Google know it absolutely everything I do. Yeah, it is. Oh good
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.920]   China will now have directly from all of our communications through the back door
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.560]   becoming soon
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.960]   Yeah, right
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.040]   Jeff do you see where we you know we specifically called out that you know
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.520]   The on hope is not going to be looking at that sort of stuff
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.440]   And it's hilarious because you can throw that you know FAQ or whatever into the middle of an online discussion people like
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.800]   I don't care of course it's going to do whatever you know, they're gonna say that that's exactly what you would say if you were Google
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah, they're not one but you know, it'd be very it'll be very easy to see what it's doing
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.960]   I mean all you have to do is run wire shark
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.220]   Well, here's the question just as they have with windows 10 and you can see exactly what's going on in the back
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.180]   Here's my real question. Can Google in turn
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.160]   Do I dare use the verb snoop on can it watch?
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.240]   What's happening back up my file so your Comcast?
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.600]   No, but Comcast can Verizon can no, but I'm sure you know, it's P knows everything
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   That's what gets me about the plane about Google way around
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.820]   Messing the way around can Google see whether by a file and Comcast are blocking certain things or
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.840]   governing certain things
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.200]   Does this give them a window on the behavior of ISPs?
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.120]   That's a really good question Jeff and I hadn't thought about that and I have no idea
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.400]   And I assume if if that sort of capability were to be offered it probably be the sort of thing
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.360]   You'd either opt into or if they do that that yeah, they'll have to tell you they're doing that that'd be pretty damn nice
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.720]   Yeah, if you had a router and it was you know, it could check all these connections
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.320]   It could tell you you're not getting the sort of connectivity that you thought you were paying for
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.880]   And it could point out where the problems are and maybe help debug, you know when people have misconfigured, you know
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.360]   There's stuff upstream and you know, why aren't you able to stream this YouTube video?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.840]   Okay, call this number and talk to this guy kind of thing
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   Yeah, and also compare and see oh gee across these you know these
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.560]   Customers of this ISP they all have slower YouTube
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:51.320]   Yeah, yeah guard your check on net neutrality. That would be a wonderful fight
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   This is scooter X in our chat room is giving us this
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:03.400]   Section from the Google agreement the Google on app and your on hub do not track the websites you visit or collect the content of any traffic on your network
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.080]   However on hub does collect data such as Wi-Fi channel
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.520]   Signal strength and device types that are relevant to optimize your Wi-Fi performance
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.040]   Google policies in terms of services apply as normal to any Google services you use like Gmail or Google search
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.960]   Whether you're using it on an on hub network or not
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.840]   That makes sense
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:30.680]   Right and this goes back to the fundamental principle that anything any terms of service when you read them sounds very scary
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.800]   Even if you know, it's not it, you know, oh now Adobe owns anything. I made in Photoshop
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.560]   Yeah, that kind of thing so hopefully Google will act quickly to you know debunk any misconceptions
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.880]   I can't yeah
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:48.120]   I mean, it's it's not worth it's not it's not worth it for Google to mess with that. No, right?
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.600]   the the the cost
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.000]   In public relations alone let alone governmental interference would be way too high
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.640]   Anyway, I don't care because I love Google and I'm going to give them all my information anyway
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:08.680]   So I'm just I'm getting the router and that's all I care about and if someday if on that three watt speaker Google says
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.480]   Leo I will listen and obey
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:20.200]   So there I just I I think it's great that Google just add a nowhere
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   There wasn't a Google IO or anything just it. Oh, by the way, you want to hub and then literally if you didn't if you didn't see the story
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.320]   Yeah, it broke what last night. I mean did you have it on all about Android?
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   You did yeah, we talked about it. I mean, but it broke late. Yeah, it was late. It was after our news
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.920]   Hey, Google's getting really good at keeping secrets. It's amazing
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.040]   I like the sense of surprise. I don't like leading up to these Nexus Nexus phones every year
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.800]   I feel like we know everything about it before you know a week before at least and I like being surprised I
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.760]   Think it's awesome
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:04.680]   It's funny because there's a couple people that I really know and trust who have worked on this product and who make me think that it
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.640]   Will be a really good. Oh good. Nice, but it's also interesting to watch the discussions about
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:14.320]   I hope this doesn't leak and will it leak and a few people checking to see whether it leaks and we're all like
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.480]   Please don't leak please don't and so it's nice to get a couple clean launches and and hopefully
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.520]   We'll keep doing that actually let me ask this why don't I mean I can understand why don't you want it to leak?
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.560]   So I'll just say from from Google's philosophy at least in the early days
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.480]   The idea was don't launch this until everything is perfect until it's completely ready
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.160]   And of course, you know as you get to be a bigger company people like oh we have Google I/O or we have various
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.520]   Partners that we're working with and so you can't prevent leaks and so you have certain deadlines
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.640]   But I think that's a really strong philosophy to say wait until something is completely ready
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.720]   And then you know once you're ready like Chrome for example once you know, it's completely ready
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   Then you can launch it and and that just gives you the freedom to polish like
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.680]   You know Google photos for example was the sort of thing where it was like
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.400]   There's always gonna be a pressure to launch it early and get it out
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.960]   And I think that team probably took a little bit longer and tried to polish it and make it really really exceptional
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.600]   And you see that reception people love it, you know a lot of people really enjoy using it
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.440]   And I think that's a great way to do things personally
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.520]   You get all of the good PR all at once instead of dribbling it out
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:30.240]   So there's two really two reasons one is so that you don't have the pressure of oh we got to live up to this
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.800]   But two that it all happens there's something exciting about a reveal
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.200]   That hasn't been telegraphed it's harder and harder to do even apples not very good at that and
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   They were the kings
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:51.040]   Well anyway, I just I know that's a crazy thing to start with but to me this was like wow. I'm excited. I'm really excited
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.120]   Let's take a break much more to come we got when you get Mac cuts in here
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.680]   You got to ask them all relevant questions plus we'll do a little tour of the new one plus two both Jason

[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.200]   Mean just a great camera. Can you have five fingers from five different hands?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.800]   Yes or toes I've heard of people even using their elbow on the Apple phone
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.040]   I don't know anything that has ridges and whirls. I know what Howard Stern's show is gonna use

[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.920]   Fresh books really solved this problem for me
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.880]   This was when I was working in Canada. So one of the things fresh books did so well multi currency
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.080]   You know you bill in any the local currency
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:09.160]   They handle it very well so that you get paid more quickly, which is great. They're a fresh books app
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:14.800]   For iOS and Android will automatically keep track of our time and hours and put it in the invoice
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.760]   You can take pictures of receipts and get it in the expense report. It's just awesome
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.480]   You don't have to be a numbers person in fact
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.640]   It's really designed for people like me who just even if I you know can do it. I don't want to do it

[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.400]   And it's a great thing living the dream. Yeah, I'm living the dream because I get to talk to you people like you and Jeff
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   And I just love it. I just it's
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.860]   Cuz I'm obsessed with technology as you can see by our discussion of that
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:13.120]   Well, I am obsessed by this stuff. I want to talk but I don't want to and I think probably this is why we have a great audience
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.560]   We're all obsessed with it, but you don't want to just sit alone and think about it. You want to talk to what do you think?
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.520]   Is this cool?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.840]   You see this around the studio all the time. I'll go up to Jason. Okay. What do you think you got the one plus two?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.280]   What do you think is it cool?
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   How do you what do you think about type C?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.040]   It's it's fun to talk about you know, I tried to talk to my wife about type C. No, it's just not the same
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   No
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:43.560]   I'm lucky therapy for us. I'm lucky. He's my wife does you you you like geek wives. Yeah, yeah
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   We're your geek wives
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:52.680]   We all do back in a week or two, right?
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.880]   Yeah, you know what I need to check in with her. I'll do that right now, you know, we're gonna call her cuz I
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.520]   Don't know if she'll do this. We're gonna ask her to we want to cover maker fair in New York. Oh
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.880]   Over the bridge
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.960]   Yeah
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.800]   Maker base. Yeah, so I yeah maker base maker fair seems like a logical thing
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.760]   I was a big fan of field trip when it came out and then Google surprised everybody with ingress a
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:27.020]   Game a wild game that some of our own staff have become addicted to some have lost weight getting better shape going around
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.880]   taking over
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   public buildings
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:39.120]   And you know weird way this would these were both created by niantic labs, which was a I think an acquisition
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.680]   And pretty much ran itself right they were pretty autonomous
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.120]   I think they were autonomous. I think I think there were there were people within Google, you know
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:56.680]   Joint keyhole for mapping all this stuff, okay, and they wanted to do niantic and Google said okay try it within Google first
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.240]   Oh, I see but yes, so now there's fun out there on their own
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   Yeah
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.320]   Their own company
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:10.000]   Hey, by the way drew all enough by line on tech crunch. That's Drew's new job. So proud of you Drew
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.080]   Good friend. Oh, yeah, it's nice to see him doing great. It's so great. Yeah
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:21.880]   Important account information niantic labs is becoming an independent company will be taking our unique blend of exploration and fun
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.320]   To even bigger audiences with some amazing new partners joining Google as collaborators and backers
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   Niantic will be building on the success of ingress, which has been downloaded more than 12 million times
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.200]   And it was not the first first spinoff. I thought we'd see from hell about
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.280]   You know, that's that's a question that I have when you say spun off from alphabet
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   does that mean that niantic is a
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.880]   component of alphabet now or I
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.800]   interpreted this as spun off as in see you guys later you're an independent company
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.520]   But we'll still kind of work with you a little bit in a collaboration with Google is and we invested it. Yeah
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.280]   Yeah, I think they are completely independent now
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.800]   So they're so outside of alphabet Google funded the spinoff
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:11.080]   What I guess it's kind of a it's a compute. It's a murky situation considering what we know about alphabet. They didn't sell it
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   No, but but they're they're independent now
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:20.800]   I believe independent outside of alphabet but the nice thing is that you know this kind of a structure let you say
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.280]   Okay, you can work within Google in theory
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.800]   You could acquire companies and you can have the CEO stay the CEO where you could you know have CEOs within?
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:34.120]   alphabet sort of you know umbrella or you know if you try that and for whatever reason
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.520]   it'll work better to be completely independent and people can always spin out that way as well and
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.360]   You know I love ingress even my wife plays
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.720]   So I wish them wish them well
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.200]   But it's kind of nice that people have a lot of different options and they can try all of those and see what works best for them
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.080]   So these were Googlers originally or some Googlers
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.720]   I believe they came in I
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.960]   John Hinky and and these these folks yes who I believe came in via the keyhole
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.640]   They were keyhole so keyhole was the mapping satellite imagery company that was bought for maps
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   So they were keyhole or it became good war. Yeah, so I think you know
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.280]   John is one of the main people and I think there's other people as well
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.320]   But I you know I know that all the geo folks, you know Brian McLinda and all these folks wish them well neat
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.560]   So yeah, it's that they were keyhole because ingress is all about maps
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.240]   What exactly yes?
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.040]   Interesting this also allows them to have their own equity. It's in essence what advanced in with reddit
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   They they bought reddit hole and then some we want to motivate staff and the executives with with equity
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.160]   So we spit it back out again, but still own. I don't know what Google owns of niacomata. Guess it's a considerable trouble
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:54.880]   Well, I don't know exactly either, but you know if you can have folks like John Hanky Brian MacLinda and Michael Jones come in
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:01.160]   Do great work at Google and then as it makes sense have them spin off or do other things and then maybe come back again
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.240]   It's all to the good and you know
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:08.920]   I I'm glad that they're gonna try this approach now and see hopefully this will have even more fun things in
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.960]   Well now but now you've raised a lot of issues because of this alphabet thing because a spin-off would be a separate
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.320]   Is it a separate stock issue?
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Is it what happens to people who are Google or now alphabet stock shareholders and this is part of it what what it I?
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.800]   What's goes
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.960]   Usually there's some sort of
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.040]   Compensation I don't understand how it works
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.640]   Well and sometimes if if a company is going to do there
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:45.120]   You know if somebody's gonna do their own thing it might be the case that you know the parent company can fund them and some
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.440]   You know become a little bit of a stakeholder so that might be what's going on and maybe they're getting a little high for that
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.160]   I'm sure it'll be this close. See
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   I mean this also allows you to give equity to founders
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.680]   If it's a whole you own subsidiary got no equity you got your stock your stock options are in our
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:09.640]   Parent company well. Yeah, but it depends what the structure is yeah of this new company too, right?
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:16.480]   Very good. You see the interesting thing that Nikesh Aurora did for equity in his company
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.840]   What do you do apparently he so he you know
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.880]   Nikesh was at Google for a long time and sort of in charge of revenue and the business side of things and he went over to SoftBank
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:33.960]   Apparently he just bought four hundred and eighty three million dollars worth of shares in SoftBank. Isn't that impressive?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.680]   almost half a billion dollars
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:43.440]   Every investment advisor in the world would say do not concentrate your treasure in one stock
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.640]   But he believes in it shows confidence
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.680]   Shows confidence SoftBank also updates stake and Sprint. I think it's now 80%
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.280]   Which is good because they sprint needs that money to
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.320]   build up their LTE infrastructure and
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:07.280]   Boy are we seeing the benefits we talked about this a little yesterday of competition in the mobile space
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:16.800]   It's great, right? So now yeah sprint joins T mobile and Verizon in eliminating early termination fees and contracts
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   You buy the phone outright or you amortize it, but you know what you paid exactly for the phone
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:28.660]   The competition has been to the prices have gone down. It's just been great in the mobile space
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.320]   This is one you can't say Google Fi did it
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.720]   but
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:40.280]   Are you using Fi Matt by the way Jeff and I owe you a debt of gratitude. Oh, yeah, big big great big great. You got us invites to Fi
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.000]   Well, I'm just happy to try to help but yeah, I am using Fi and I really like it
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.600]   You know the Wi Fi calling is is the audio is really good. So it is excellent
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.240]   Yeah, cell phones and landlines and yeah, that's kind of nice
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:05.440]   And that's again Sprint is one of the carriers on file on with T mobile and Wi Fi so a stronger sprint is good for
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.280]   So it all comes around right
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.320]   Well, and you have to give T mobile a lot of credit for
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:19.680]   Taking that uncoach and getting you know rid of the contracts and stuff because I never thought I'd see Verizon say
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.200]   Okay, we've been rid of those two years up city kind of things
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:29.280]   Yeah, just stunning Jeff. Did you ever think you see that? No, no, and I'm still waiting to connect my Nexus 7
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.800]   Did you ever go?
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.560]   No, it's on T mobile. Did you ever go Fi?
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.600]   No, because I told my saga
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.520]   I'm still trying because that's where I want to buy the next phone so that the Nexus 6 becomes the
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.680]   Deafone because I still be a T and D and limited because dear you are you sorry you asked now
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.440]   No, I think you're smart and if the next is because you want a five
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.160]   Right, you don't want it that six is huge. Oh, no. I like I like the big you do I got old eyes. No, that's fine
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.080]   but
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.960]   The Fi case makes it just a silly millimeter too big for my
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.320]   Switchy thing in the car
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:18.440]   Why use the case is the case you don't know I'm intrinsically tied to the cases. Okay, I have no idea
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.960]   I didn't know maybe there was like an extra antenna in the case
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:29.680]   My my Nexus 6 case yes, it's just an indent for these buttons. It doesn't work very well
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:36.000]   This add you buttons on I agree a hundred percent. Well, it's why I kept it on too as ugly as it is
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I like it. Yeah, it has buttons on the buttons
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.440]   Instead of just having a cutout where you have to reach in and do the volume
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.640]   Yeah, no, it's so funny because that's exactly why I kept it
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:54.160]   Even though it's kind of ugly now. I have really I have phones in every size. I have a five inch
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.640]   You sure do I have a five and a half inch I have a five point seven try I have a six inch
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.360]   I've been trying to I got I
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:08.640]   I'm supposed to be able to get into some new stuff at Facebook with the video which we talked about last week's an
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:14.120]   Open deal mentions are you getting are you getting an image? Oh, I hope so. No, but the problem is it's only iOS
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:21.960]   I got it. I got it ready. So I pull up my old iPhone 4 which just feels like a just the diggiest
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.600]   It feels obscenely small. That's three and a half inches
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:32.120]   Ridiculous talk about shrinkage. Yeah, yeah, George Costanza times. He's Louise
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.240]   Been just just
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.640]   Ridiculous did they ever get you in
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.880]   No
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.480]   So here's the deal. So here's the deal on mentions
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.160]   You I'm verified profile
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.800]   You have to have a verified page
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:57.400]   None of my pages are verified only my profile is verified. So Ricky's your vase Trey Radcliffe is on mentions. Oh
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:02.640]   Those are the two I've seen there's others I
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.240]   I would I would introduce you to the person who probably help
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.800]   No, I don't want to say that I always feel guilty. I feel guilty that I got a
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.040]   one plus
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.000]   Because of you Jeff. I feel guilty that I got
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Because of you now I owe you
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.880]   Chris Matthew said Chris Matthews in his book hardball said the secret to politics is to get people to do you favors
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.920]   Because weirdly enough
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:39.480]   I owe you I feel like I owe you because you didn't mean favor truthfully you owe me more because you did me a favor
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.840]   You did me favors every week
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.040]   This is a favor. So now I've co-opted you both
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.400]   No, you you guys do a huge favor showing up on this show. It would not be as interesting if we're just me
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.720]   So I'm very grateful in fact. It's just this mutual
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.640]   Favorist aside, but I just I don't want to I
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.680]   Feel funny doing that. I just want them to give it to me for my own merit
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.760]   Shit, so what would you do with it Jeff if you got mentions Facebook mentions
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:16.080]   What would you do to play with the video and play with the the news and I want to take it to my students?
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.760]   The issue is of course, it's issued to an individual so to try my
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:26.240]   My school is institution. We can't give on the love to you know 110 students
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.840]   Well, I wish somebody would because Ricky Gervais just basically keeps posting pictures of his cat
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.160]   I know but I find it amusing as hell. I
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.400]   Am not a Ricky Gervais. I was a Ricky Gervais family with the office, but this is what wack hole last week on this
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.680]   This is not a you this is
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:51.160]   Not and that's the thing I would I wouldn't do it if I didn't feel like I could bring more to the table than a picture of my cat I
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.480]   Guess he's saying something is he saying something?
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.320]   Oh, yeah, he does and then other thing is it feels like it's kind of wonky because doesn't it continue to crash
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:07.920]   What's he saying? I've been I've been edited. Thanks for asking
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.000]   Say nice and people
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.840]   Aaron Wollton hi, I get to press just
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:22.920]   Just listening C Leo NBC is to you as you are to Ricky Gervais
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.360]   Bcs to me as I am Ricky Gervais
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.120]   Just insulted me wait, right? Let me see like a twit and say what's not television?
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.720]   That's not and you're looking for you here. He's the same. Well, that's not not vid in live video. That's that's crap
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   So who does he look down on yeah, right? Who's at the bottom of that pit?
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:51.200]   Or would you say top of that pyramid? All right, let's see who else is is streaming live a video?
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.600]   I don't think he's well on my feet anyway. I guess others are probably doing it
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.960]   Oprah's probably got a live stream. You know they should give it to the the Donald Trump
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:08.120]   Oh, man talk about ratings used it who the breeder Williams
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.760]   I mean
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   Serena Serena Serena Serena. Oh Felicia Day has it. Oh
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.440]   She's got a good book good timing because she's got a new book
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   Was she sorry
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:32.440]   That is funny
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.480]   Well now at least we know who Ricky Gervais looks down on
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:58.440]   What else what else I don't I think huh?
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:04.760]   Wait, what else we just did one story. It's only done so far Ashley Madison that I only have two words for you
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.720]   The data is the data is coming out. I noticed you're both here good
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:18.480]   You haven't left the country that's a good sign also clear. I do not eat it subway. Yeah
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:25.220]   I don't know what I shouldn't say port Jared, but that that did not that did not go as expected
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.480]   14
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.840]   It's a sick thing
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:37.760]   Google is testing drones off that topic quickly didn't yeah. Well, what is there to say?
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.520]   Lot to be cheating. Hmm. Yeah cheaters
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.680]   Lot of them you just imagine the poor interns at Gawker. Oh, they're having fun
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.440]   You know as we're gonna their butts office for Chan as they dig through it
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.800]   It was a huge amount of data many many gigabytes. That's what I'm saying it
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.840]   They probably have interns change to a desk a galker doing it
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.760]   Well, you know somebody's quickly as quickly as you can writing a database search
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.320]   So that you can look your name up
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.880]   Wikipedia entities against
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.840]   Yeah, is it real name in there? I guess all because we're kind of car
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.680]   There's email addresses. There's real names email addresses and a record of every transaction now
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:27.040]   I don't understand how Ashley Madison works. Do you pay for each hookup? Leo? I'm gonna be very clear with this
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   I have no idea
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:35.320]   No one would admit this no idea no idea
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:47.520]   Howard would know they apparently they charge $19 to delete you from their database right which was like right
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.160]   Yeah, so they'd earned like 1.7 million for just the removals from their database
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:59.560]   Which is also pretty funny slash scary now do it now have those removed no they were still in there ended up on I think
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.040]   What they said is they I think the hackers said now
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.720]   We haven't seen it yet in the dump to verify
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:09.840]   But I believe that that one of the things that incensed the hackers about Ashley Madison is this
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.360]   $19 fee to remove your name and they didn't even remove your name because it's still in the date of them
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:19.480]   But we don't we'll find out what we I can imagine a class action lawsuit
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.400]   Ruining Ashley Madison sleeping on the couch tonight
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.280]   Is there an Ashley Madison? I have no I like a person or is it like Betty Crocker
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.800]   I think you stern has interview because because he they advertise on stern of course right
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.440]   I think stern interviewed the guy. I thought what do I see is something was a guy
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.400]   It's not a 90%
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.200]   No, of course it's a guy of course it is of course. It's a guy. What am I thinking made up name?
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.040]   Jesus Leo well now my thinking
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.240]   What is the 90% of the clients are men
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:54.960]   Of course, but that means there aren't a lot of matches to be had oh oh cuz you have to be a there has to be a female
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.200]   Member to match you up. Well, that's the whole idea. Oh, I don't understand it
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   I thought maybe we go and look for people for you. You heard the
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.720]   commercial serious commercial just hilarious
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.440]   because the man's voice says
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:16.520]   Well, I saw your E. I saw your you left your browser open and I saw something. What is this you were in on Ashley Madison?
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:22.480]   And she says well actually I'm glad you said that because I just am not satisfied
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.320]   And I love you and we have the kids and the house and the mortgages and all that but I I just need more and
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:33.480]   And he says well, I guess I understand that and then she says you know basically you want to do that too
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.220]   And he says what a good idea. Oh my god
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:44.320]   There's that marriage doomed to fail or maybe not I shouldn't judge. I'm not judging no judgment
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.840]   Google won the internet says wired now it wants to cure disease
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.520]   I'm happy about this the ambitions of Google will never end
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.200]   So this is one of the alphabet
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:04.120]   companies Google life sciences that's the glucose sensing contact lens we've heard about and
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:12.160]   Calico and they're just a story out also on the run out there working on a bandage sized a cloud connected
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.560]   Blood-glue glucose
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.800]   Monitor which is just a huge for diabetics. Absolutely. You love this. Yeah, this is awesome
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:26.600]   You know where I'm going with this I've been reading lately about new hearing aid devices
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:32.520]   That will do many of these things the newest wearables as as as we age out of the
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.040]   mainstream Jeff
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.040]   the newest wearables are
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.160]   Earpieces so Bragi has this dash which are Bluetooth headsets
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.120]   But they that they hope to do more you can do obviously heart rates easy, but
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.040]   They can see thoughts coming in and out of your ears. I don't know
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:56.560]   When steam comes out of your ears they'll know
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.360]   Anyway, I'm actually believe it or not
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.160]   I
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   As soon as I heard about this made an appointment with the
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:09.760]   Audiologist down the street for a hearing test because I'm hoping I can get some of these new fangled hearing age
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.600]   Are they on the market?
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.080]   You know Starkey's doing some stuff. I don't know. I'll find out
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.720]   But that's but that that to me is a sensible wearable of course
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:28.120]   Maybe that's because I go through life wearing headphones. Yeah, you do right. So you feel naked without I do I'm wearing them right now
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.360]   imagine
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:37.560]   Instead of being wired headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones that have Bluetooth amplifier, but then they're also doing metrics and
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.040]   You know measuring my glucose and my heart rate
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.440]   Giving you instructions giving me instruction life. They have they have microphones. I can talk to them
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.440]   They can talk to me. I
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.720]   Just feel like there's stuff going on here some broccoli eat more brock you should eat that broccoli
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.360]   We were talking about humans
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:05.440]   We always talk about humans which no yes, I know but this is a TV show called humans and I just started watching it and
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.400]   It's on AMC and William Hertz in it
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.680]   And he's an older fellow who kept his robot six years and it's starting to wear out
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   it's got little blue gel coming out of his nose and
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.480]   starting to wear out so he says getting he gets a new one and
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.840]   He's this is a robot nurse and
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:31.760]   He says what is this I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. She said your dietary profile calls for broccoli soup
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:40.560]   You know
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.160]   This is what Google will do just a matter of time
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   Rockley soup last September Google bot lifting of labs makers of lift where a high-tech spoon
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.880]   It's designed to help people with tremors narrative to generative tremors eat
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:03.560]   So it's a it's actually it's a image stabilized stabilization spoon. I
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.320]   Stabilization life stabilization
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:12.400]   Really interesting stuff. I'm sorry. I interrupted you and you probably were to say something much more interesting that
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.400]   Oh
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.860]   I was just gonna say speaking of good for you, you know solar energy is awfully
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.760]   Oh, let's talk about that and I'm gonna be some roof. This is I wish I was so unhappy
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.560]   It wasn't for my address not my address either and we're just but if you're in the Bay Area it is
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.400]   So tell us about this man have you done it's you're you can do it where you are right
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.280]   Yeah, they've got it in the Bay Area of California
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:45.640]   They've got it in the Boston area and they've got it in Fresno and they're going to expand to the rest of the country
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.440]   You know in the coming months. I needed a dress a San Francisco address so I can enter it in here
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.440]   Two three five second street
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.600]   Okay, that's the CNET building probably that's the CNET building
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:03.720]   How did I know look at that? Oh my god that roof has
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.920]   689 hours of usable sunlight a year and
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:14.440]   24,000 square feet you would save $13,000 if they put Sunroof
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.960]   On there
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.280]   So what I can drag the marker let's go to it. That's let's go residential somewhere, right?
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.680]   So what I love about this is
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:33.600]   Somebody for their 20% project decided to process all of the Google Earth data and not just you know
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:40.400]   Do a roof detector, but they can actually try to do 3d modeling of a bunch of different roof set scale try to figure out
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.960]   Trees that are nearby so how much shadow you're going to have and then they say okay?
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   Where's the Sun gonna be all year? Where's the clouds?
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:54.840]   Historically the temperature patterns and so massive level of processing and it turns out the vast majority of people
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.880]   you know in the next few years will benefit from switching to solar and
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:06.880]   The the main limiter in switching to solar these days is less and less about the cost of the modules because they're getting cheaper and more about the cost of
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:14.320]   The solar providers finding the customers and so if you can push that down a little bit more solar solar gets cheaper
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.600]   You know and and people just get you know better renewable energy and so
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.200]   It's it's one of my favorite 20% projects that I've ever seen I don't know where I am
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.040]   I'm trying to get something more residue. Here's a house something more residential
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   So this house
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.160]   Has 1,833 hours of usable sunlight
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:42.800]   1,739 square feet available and would say 14,000 I mean this is real luddy and
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   Then it gives you more information about
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:50.680]   You could say what your monthly electric mic monthly electric bill is 250 bucks
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:55.560]   Record recommended installation size average annual savings. I mean
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.980]   Francisco go go go to the Richmond district in San Francisco. Well, I think that's where I am somewhere
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.640]   There is no Sun there
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:11.000]   Yeah, it's course the picture shows a sunny day and beautiful. I don't know where this is. It's a lot of houses
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.480]   Oh, you know what I could do. Let's go small
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:20.160]   Wow, this is cool. That's as small as I can go. I think
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.640]   Is that SF or is that the yeah, this is still San Francisco. I just scrolled away from
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.560]   The upper left that's that's the peers and
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.480]   Here's go all the way to the left. Yeah, we're gonna go to the Richmond district the fog belt
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.560]   Is that that's 20 feet? It's always fog. It's always always here's the ocean. All right, so there we go
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.760]   Let's go down here. Let's pick somewhere right on the ocean where it's fog right there. Yeah
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.080]   All right. Oh crap
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   $38,000
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.680]   Well, anybody want to give me an address
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:04.040]   Oh, I know women. I know I used to live in San Francisco. Hey, let's do this again
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   I just thought of this I could give my old address. I used to live on Maraga Street. What was that? Let's say
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.000]   2400
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Maraca this was out in the
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.480]   Out in the avenues. Yeah, the sunset. That's that's not
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   One of the buildings here's a here's a home
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.920]   Drag this over here. All right. Well see us $13,000 stills
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:35.720]   That's that's pretty good and that's based on 125 bucks electricity if you use more and then they show you lease
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:44.680]   loan and in both cases zero upfront cost after incentives or by which cost you 12,000
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.120]   But you'd you'd save
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.720]   36,000 so it'd pay you back in eight years
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.080]   So do either of you have solar in your houses not yet
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.920]   That you man thinking about pulling the trigger. I am too and
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.560]   There's this great author
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.200]   Ramese Nomm he actually used to work in the search division of Bing but thank goodness now he he's like a futurist and right sci-fi
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.320]   Thrillers and all these things. I'm like, yeah, don't work at Bing anymore
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.640]   But he has this great stuff where he talks about solar and you know in the next
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:22.880]   Decatur so it's going to be half the price or or it's trending toward half the price of fossil fuel and in California
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.240]   It's already basically economically viable to switch over to solar and you'll see how many pretty quickly because we get all this
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.280]   And it's going to be
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.560]   Yeah, in a lot of states though faster than people expect
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:40.400]   And so what I really like is if you scroll all the way down on a given address it will it will even show five or six different solar providers
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   Oh, this is great. Oh wow
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.520]   I mean the main reason why I haven't pulled the triggers
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.600]   It's like you got to do the research and find out yes
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.080]   Like and this way you can just instantly kind of take you to the people who can help you
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.320]   This is I think Sun powers the one you want
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:00.160]   You know what I want I want somebody that can give me Elon Musk's battery
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:07.840]   Solar City. Yeah solar city is not on this list oddly. No, that's weird. Well, this is just well. Oh, these are sponsored
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.040]   Our service is free to you, but we may be compensated by some of these solar companies
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.400]   Thing
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.200]   Well, even if you make money at it, you can still get people on solar a lot more. That's fine
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.120]   And uh, and I suspect that's why they haven't rolled it out to the country is they have to find people who can be solar providers in each of these
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   Region which takes a lot of elbow grease
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.920]   This is exciting. This is really cool. Yeah, we've been wanting to do this. We have absolutely a perfect property for this
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.680]   And I we're already on a well. I would love to get off the grid and have battery see so I could just really
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.320]   When the zombie apocalypse hits
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:56.160]   I don't care. Of course that means he's built a 30-foot wall around the building and arm myself, but hey with that
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.040]   Well, aussie will protect aussie will do it
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.560]   Uh, we we had to spend we spent 15 grand
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.360]   On a whole house generator. Oh
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.480]   Wow, because you were worried about storms
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.600]   Well after sandy we were out of the house for two weeks
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:19.680]   Uh really getting yeah, it was it was and so uh, and I was very lucky very very lucky to have gotten rooms at marion
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.160]   Were you out of the house because there was no power?
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.680]   There's no power and it was cold and plus we're on we're also on well, which means there's no toilet right
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.720]   When the power is out there's no water right and so the cat was here
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.760]   It was getting to the point where it was cold enough that it was gonna be unsafe for the cat
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.000]   The cat doesn't want to move
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:45.360]   Hey, um, so of course all of all of these coast can thank us dearly for having put the generator in because now since then of course
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.040]   There's no storms and there never will be because you bought a jet
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.880]   But i'm gonna come out to california and wash my car so we'll start raining for you right
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:05.440]   I'm very intrigued. I think this is again. This is this is an example of a virtuous circle because yeah
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.960]   there's advertising on this page for these solar companies
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960]   but
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:16.880]   Because of that, this is probably makes money for google bravo because this is a great resource
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.800]   This is uh, i'm thrilled. This is fabulous. So this is a 20 percent event
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.480]   Yeah, it was a 20 project
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.760]   I it's more than one person. I think the team is based or it started the project in boston
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   Which is why they also show solar in the boston area, but what really
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.400]   Just hugely surprises me is

[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.800]   We're talking google the google what do you leave in me leo
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.840]   What would you like would you like a phone because i've got a few
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.320]   nice now
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.160]   I gave to borack on sunday. I gave to borack the moto g
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.520]   Because I knew I was gonna get two phones this week
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.280]   And we're not even done the new iPhones come out in three weeks
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:08.720]   I don't it's kind of the point where I don't I don't even want to buy them and lisa says no you have to this is your job
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.280]   That's uh, that's pretty cool though
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.680]   Uh, you have to buy a phone twist my arm. Oh no. Do you know how many numbers I have
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.640]   You
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   You can give one to
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.760]   I you know what I don't answer the
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:32.080]   The irony of it. I don't even answer the phone anymore. I really don't unless it's unless it's like my daughter my son
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.200]   lisa, I don't answer the phone
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.760]   because uh
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.080]   It's too much for half the time. It's the democratic national committee trying to get money out of me
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.000]   Don't ever if you ever ever give money to a political campaign, you will never hear the end of it
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.600]   So, but I see I still will give but I just don't want to do it over the phone
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.400]   That's too much pressure
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.040]   uh drones in space
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.120]   They're using the nasa exception
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.080]   U. S uh air space
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.720]   Of course there are limits on what you can do with drones
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.360]   Uh, but and in fact, I think if you're a commercial enterprise
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.960]   It's uh, it's even more limited
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:27.280]   But what uh, they're doing is they have a as you know a deal a land deal
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:34.960]   For something with nasa. Let me see. Let me read this out loud because I was I they struck a deal with nasa
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:42.320]   They're testing drones capable of speeds up to 100 miles an hour. They'll weigh less than 55 pounds
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:49.760]   Uh, there is a blanket on the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft in the u. S. Thanks to the faa, but google
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.960]   Project wing
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.520]   Uh, take is taken to the air
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.320]   Because they have uh, they're over private lands by the way. They're not over you
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.080]   Because they have a certificate of waiver or authorization from nasa
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:13.440]   The certificate lets public normally lets public organizations like the military state universities police or fire departments
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.720]   experiment with unmanned aerial systems
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.840]   Um, but I guess uh
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.440]   Google has made a deal of some kind it's over private land for crying out loud
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.960]   They're trying to see whether cell phone signals
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.800]   Can be used by low flying drones for automatic air traffic control
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.880]   I you know, uh, I love the rnd stuff at google. This is mind boggling
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.920]   Well, Matt was talking to our edge had this vision of of of
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:54.640]   They're a sitting in a room probably no desk because he wouldn't have something standard like that just thinking
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.840]   What do I tackle next?
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.640]   Where is their how does that work matt dude is I okay? That's not how I imagine it jeff
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.400]   I imagine larry sitting in a chair something like this chair
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.200]   With his fingers steepled
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.400]   I imagine it's all white and he's very entirely white and there is
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.360]   One door in the room through which comes an infinite procession of engineers saying
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.160]   you have and larry says
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.680]   Thrill me
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.840]   And the engineer has five minutes. Does he have a cat in his arms? Yeah, he could have mr
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840]   Bigel's worth in his yeah
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.280]   Tell me what your plan is and the engineer says okay, uh mr. Page. I've got this idea
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:43.520]   We're gonna put some drones up in the air with cell phone technology. They'll fly off flight plans receive directions from computerized air traffic control systems
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.520]   and
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:51.120]   It'll make money for everybody and larry says larry says uh, but you forgot about this and this and this and this
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.280]   Yes, sir. Mr. Page, sir
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   I i'm right i'm on it
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.680]   Isn't that how it works
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.800]   Matt
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   You nailed it
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:08.400]   No, but I do I don't think larry has to uh generate all this himself he probably does
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   But I imagine there are people constantly
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.960]   Well, absolutely coming to him with great ideas, but he's also looking at big problems, right?
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.280]   That's what jazz is ever that's what that was one that's what the whole amazon story fascinating about is that
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:26.240]   You know the new york times can't understand that somebody cares deeply about big problems and the big problems were hard work
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:32.720]   Um, and and so yeah, certainly people come to larry page and say i've got a great idea i've got a great problem
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.320]   But I also but he has that's important. He has the freedom now to say hmm
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.680]   What if I tackle diabetes?
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:47.680]   Yeah, and larry is a um, he's a scientist and he gets excited about reasoning from first principles
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.040]   So, you know if you say this is how much the phone costs
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.600]   You know, he might look at it. He's a well
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.240]   How about the raw materials, you know, why does it cost more than the raw materials, you know
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.880]   And and so he does get excited about those kinds of things like, uh, you know
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:09.360]   mccani is this uh wind energy company that's sort of in google x and the idea of like oh what can you do with
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:15.040]   You know with wind energy and kites and and so anything that's got an or when he gets really interested
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.440]   You know meetings tend to just like spill over long because you know like street view
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.320]   What sensors can you put on a car and what kind of data can you get and and
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.320]   All those sorts of things reasoning from first principles like how long does it take and how much money would it take to scan all the world's books
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.200]   You know those are the sorts of things that are like catnip for his mr
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.200]   Big old man. I'm so jealous and
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.520]   Not the i mean that's the dream that is the dream really is
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.560]   This is why you know I wrote a post a long time ago
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.320]   What I wish google would do for news and I wish you were excited about this idea
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.680]   But if you get done the first principles you you absolutely ignore everything that we know today about how it's done since it's
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:57.280]   100 years old 150 years old instead of you to the first principle of saying what does society need to know?
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.040]   And how do we help them know it? How do we gather information? That's the kind of thing that the google attacks
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.360]   That's the way to look at read look at big problems
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:13.680]   Is that a first principle and you'll see um, it's interesting because like how how do you support, you know good media
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:21.120]   You know and and so uh oody manber had done some really interesting analysis about like how much money do you need to pay someone's salary?
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.680]   Okay, how many page views do you need at what ad rate?
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.440]   And it's that sort of stuff that leads you to things like google contributor, which by the way is open without any
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.920]   Uh invites now and now anybody can subscribe to it and that's the sort of thing where it's like, okay
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:38.320]   Where what are the different business models? How do you play with that and that's very fun to think about yeah?
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.960]   Hmm
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   Do you
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.480]   Think see I would all right so if I made an infinite amount of money
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.440]   And 20 30 billion that's as good as infinite
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.800]   Yeah, I would feel responsible
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.200]   Do like I now have a respect I have a duty
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.680]   Not to
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.720]   Just getting the boat and go and screw you guys
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.640]   I would feel I have now a duty because I have these
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.240]   Immense unimaginable resources to use them wisely
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.040]   Is that kind of I mean, I don't know if it's I don't I doubt he thinks it's a burden
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.360]   It's probably a joy, but I think that there is a sense of responsibility you must have
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:31.520]   You know, I'm not sure he thinks about it as a sense of responsibility so much as it's really fun
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.480]   Yeah, me to do and wouldn't it be great to do this and you know like a sir gay, you know
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.800]   A lot we often joke that he's you know, well between Larry and sir gay. It's kind of like Batman and Ironman a little bit
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.040]   They do enjoy the gadgets as well. You got enjoy doing all that stuff
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.160]   But the the chance to do something that nobody's ever done before I think that is so appealing
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.640]   What what drives them though? What drives them? What drives Larry?
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:03.920]   I mean he is fundamentally interested in how the world works and why it doesn't work better
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.680]   and you know, he's got some large interests like energy and transportation and
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.120]   Those sorts of things, but you know, he he's very well read on a lot of different topics
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.000]   And so the science of it and why things work certain ways
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.280]   And why can't we experiment more and I think he's also fascinated. I'm guessing right? This is all my personal opinion. Oh, yeah
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.280]   We should I'm putting you in a terrible position because I mean
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:33.840]   Larry's gonna be like what are you telling people my motivation? You don't know a thing about me
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:42.000]   You haven't seen me for this long. Yeah, but but but you're the closest thing to somebody on the inside that we got so
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.440]   And I'm just and I don't mean and I don't mean in any way a challenging thing either. I'm just really interested
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   You know, you feel like I think Steve Jobs said and I thought this was really
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:58.160]   Interesting and telling that there was a point where he realized that everything around him was made up by somebody
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.720]   Probably somebody not as bright as him
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.760]   And so when he realized that he said I realized I could this is not a this is written in stone
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.680]   It's all made up by humans and I can do whatever I can change it in any way I want. It's all clay
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.840]   Uh, and so that was what motivated him was this thought that I can you know what?
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.640]   Maybe there's a better way to do something and I can you know, Leo, you're you're you're pointing about the kind of responsibility
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.720]   I've had jobs where I end up on a happy and I can't get anything done
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.360]   I go home with you know the day and I think it's not my current job. Just be clear
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.440]   I think you know, I I cost them end dollars today
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.680]   And I didn't actually get any done. I went to stupid meetings. I got nothing accomplished of value
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.480]   I didn't increase the value from this from the worst the worst feeling there is for work. I think is to do that
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.120]   Well, you're Larry page
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.560]   You know, you sit there and say I just thought about you know marshmallows for an hour
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:54.160]   I could have I could have solved a v.a. You know, I I could have done something I
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.120]   There's got to be a little of that right? I think I think because that's the way
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.280]   Because that's the ethos of google that people don't understand I think about google
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:09.040]   That's because because you know, I when people were starting to get the second day angle on alphabet was well
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.840]   Let's be let's not trust Larry page. It's a cynical act by here
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:18.720]   I said what have you seen the man accidentally right? He doesn't accidentally the company doesn't act cynically really doesn't all in all
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do some crappy stuff and but I was a bad answer but I'm fine fine fine fine
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.280]   There is a company but but all at all it acts trying to solve problems
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.640]   And that's what has to be
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.880]   There's people like Larry Ellison as an example. Yeah
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:39.680]   For him billions of dollars means I'm gonna build a bigger yacht
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:46.720]   Yes, and I'm and I'm a higher up on the rich list than either. I'm a three comma guy. I'm in the three comma club
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.760]   I shouldn't I don't know Larry. I maybe
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:56.080]   Probably he's not the case either. I know he actually has done some amazing things, but I feel like Larry and Sergey
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.800]   And people like Elon Musk is I put them in the same category, which is
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.760]   And we think of them as Superman we think of them as Starks because
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.400]   They're
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:14.320]   Areas of concern are so different so much more than lofty than I'm just worried about the groceries and what I'm gonna make for dinner
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.160]   and
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.880]   Larry's starting to think about well if could could you know, how could we how could we end death?
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:27.040]   And you can have plenty of time to decide what to make for dinner
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.080]   Yeah, I'm sure Larry still has to think about dinner. I don't know everybody does but
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:39.360]   I just it's where we live in remarkable times and it's wonderful that we can celebrate people
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.640]   uh like Larry Page and Sergey Brin
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.440]   and what they're doing
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.160]   And so I just wanted to get some insight. I wasn't trying to pry or be nosy or gossip, but I just
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.640]   No, no
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.400]   I think it's good because
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:01.200]   Google also provides a good structure where people can keep larrying Sergey honest if if they're you know if they get too far off
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.080]   kilter
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.880]   You know, you've got a lot of people who can push the bag red button and say oh, I I think google is doing something wrong here
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:14.880]   And Larry and Sergey also rely very much on people who are you get some really really really smart people who are doing deep thinking in areas
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:21.120]   You know nothing about and then they can bring you proposals like what would you do with a depth sensing camera and you know
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.680]   Need things you could do but one of the more inspiring things I've heard like I say is is essentially
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:31.200]   You know the worst thing to do is to just come in and automatically do what you did yesterday
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.040]   You kind of need to always be thinking about not just inertia, you know, you have a limited time on earth
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.440]   So so what is the biggest impact thing you could do?
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.640]   And if you just are doing the exact same thing you did yesterday then you're probably not thinking about it hard enough and
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.400]   And that's why I've always thought of myself as lazy because I just you know
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:53.440]   I just want you know, it's easy to get in a ride comfortable pair of slippers
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:00.960]   A good chair and something on tv. That's really unreal. That's what you want to watch is
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.520]   I'll watch these say for hot chocolate and you know a blanket
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.160]   I'm not you know and and and then I look at people like larry page and I just feel terrible
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.320]   It's like this guy
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.440]   He does not think that way. It's a responsibility of a generation too. I'm right this week
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:22.560]   I'm brainwashing our entire class of 110 students at our our new class at kuni and I love doing this and hope that i'm
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.680]   I'm giving some value, but when I keep pushing the induceing you're you guys have to invent the future
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.760]   I'm too old and they happen. Yeah, we're doing what we do it our generation
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.800]   You have to question and it's what I do is spend all this time getting them to understand why we do stuff the way we do it
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:40.080]   So they can question it so they can say well, that's a dumb way to do that
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.720]   Why you know there's no reason to keep doing it that way. What's our our our first principle?
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.280]   What's our real goal here and reconsider it from the ground up
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.760]   And and I say, you know, you if you don't do it, nobody's gonna do it. So it's your job, man. You got to do this
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:04.240]   Okay, it's enough. I mean, we don't have to belabor it. I just it's fascinating. What we do is belabor things
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:12.240]   All right, let's talk about this amazon thing because I have to I have to say this there seems to be an
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.040]   Continuing trend at the New York Times
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.080]   To pursue an agenda
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.440]   To not try to get things right but often to get things wrong
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:26.240]   Um to it almost is it feels like it's turning into a wall street journal in me
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.720]   Jeff, is that true
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.040]   That's what I worry about I admire and love the New York times. I think there's a great deal
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.000]   I'm unhappy about their Hillary Clinton coverage. Okay. That's politics
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.560]   The story that they messed up. I've been happy about some other things recently, but the amazon story
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.880]   I read I'm sure you all saw on monday this huge long story
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:51.440]   Just torturous detail about the about working in amazon and I had the same reaction every I know had it first was oh crap
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.080]   Oh, that's no place to work. Yeah, and we believed I initially believed it because of course I believe it too
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.840]   Yeah, and and and I have you know for the individual anecdotes and that's the point. It's all anecdotal
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:09.520]   It is entirely anecdotal for the individual anecdotes. I have no doubts that those individual anecdotes are are well reported from their sources
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.920]   But as I thought about it my first thing I tweeted and I did a joke and I thought you know
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.760]   Well, let's think about what it's like to work in newsrooms where you work ridiculously long hours and people abuse you
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.000]   but you also have a lot of passion for what you do and um
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.360]   And and and you get you know rotten treatment
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.000]   Um, so what's the difference? And I thought well
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.120]   How many places are are why I like that works? Not wonderful. Well, yeah, the world isn't google
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.320]   Um, the world isn't facebook and amazon's more like the real world than the rest
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.880]   So as I thought about this and then and then of course
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.480]   a a rebuttal from a an engineer at
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.960]   At amazon came out very lengthy. I loved it because it was really really you can tell this guy's really a corporate guy
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.800]   My favorite verb was about how we're gonna action things
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.480]   Um, so he talks like a corporate guy and and and said this is not the amazon
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.120]   I know i've been there a year and a half. I haven't seen people crying at their desks
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.400]   I didn't see abuse if if they saw the abuse I think they'd do something about it
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.640]   So I wrote about this journalistic they say my problem with the story in the end was this
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.000]   That it didn't have enough context number one and I can't believe i'm saying this but balance
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.720]   I don't mean the fox fair and balanced way, but context what I mean by context is how does this compare to other workplaces?
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.240]   You're writing this whole thing about how amazon is this horrible thing? Well, how is it really worse from working for golden sacks?
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.440]   Then balance is
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440]   Okay, so you found all this bad stuff
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.880]   The only good things are said by hand-picked people given to them by amazon and they are obviously discounted the way this is written because hey
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.720]   Those are the corporate stujans
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.000]   I find it difficult to believe that in their in their six months of reporting interviewing a hundred people they found no one
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.080]   Who likes working there? No one who really pushed back very hard against this
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:01.120]   If they had shown more of that and if they had left it to me as the reader to decide whether amazon's an awful place to be that's journalism
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:06.080]   That would be journalism. So there are things that I think are are obviously worrisome about this piece
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:12.560]   Someone coming up with you know coming back to force back from work after a miscarriage and and being forced to make a trip
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.680]   If that happened then then yes, that's awful
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:22.960]   But is that systemic in the whole company? I have no evidence by which to judge a system of anonymous feedback about people
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.200]   Uh whether or not it's used well or awfully. I would find that abhorrent. I can't stand anonymity at a workplace
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.800]   I think that's just awful. You know be every every system can be gamed
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.960]   So i'll i'll count that on the by the way jeff baysles's response said if you if you know of this, please use that system
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.920]   Tell us who's being who's making people cry
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.440]   Yeah, he didn't deny that that system exists. Oh, so is it I don't want that to see that spread elsewhere
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.720]   So the times could have been better the next day they put the destroy basically giving the context and saying
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.440]   Oh, yeah, a lot of other workplaces are really crappy too
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:02.080]   Then market Sullivan who is the magnificent wonderful brilliant um bid'sman or public editor at the times
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.400]   Uh wrote a piece and of course she's brilliant because she agreed with me. I was just gonna say she
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.880]   She quotes you and says he's right
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.960]   And and said this this didn't go far enough this wasn't good enough and and so it's it's it's it's to me profoundly
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.800]   Disappointing when our pinnacle of journalism does something like this and yeah, I think it is to an extent
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.200]   It's not yellow will go that far but but but the times this is an important thing for businesses
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.600]   We're talking about all the stuff. It's it's more polemic than reporting though. It's more taking a point of view
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.940]   I always say look at the business model and and know one of the things I did say by the way is that they should have been clear about the
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:42.000]   Disclosure that bazos owns their primary competitor the washington post who many say is jumping up on the times
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.320]   I do not believe for a second that the new york times did this as an agenda against bazos in the post
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.360]   But some people there do have a a a jones for amazon. They've been doing other
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.360]   Overly tough reporting on amazon as far as i'm concerned. This the paper allowed this to go in my last point is this
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.400]   The paper is now supported
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.800]   in majority by
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.000]   subscription by the public who buys it and people think well that's good because advertising corrupts
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.720]   Well, we have pretty good systems for keeping an advertising walled off from influencing us
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.240]   But when we want to appeal to the public
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.480]   We end up doing things that I think yes do tend toward the sisational
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.520]   And this isn't a headless body found on a topless bar
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.080]   But in a sense, that's a new york times version of that
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.160]   So the nail salon story was very good too, but they're trying to go for and i've been there
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.000]   I know the business when you try to push up your circulation and push up your numbers
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.560]   You try to get the stories that are really gonna grab people
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.000]   Yeah, and they tried to grab them with amazon and I think it went too far now having said all that
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.120]   I'm really eager to hear mad's perspective on this having worked at a tech company
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.160]   Don't speak about time but that one that but just what's the view of
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.120]   People working in tech companies and how hard they work
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.240]   I'm done
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.680]   Oh, man, that's a great question
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:56.960]   I mean google
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.880]   What's interesting is I remember the cultural shift from the early days of the startup to the days when people didn't come in on the weekends
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.400]   Anymore because I came in one weekend and I was like wait, where is everyone here?
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.240]   But yeah, what's this is oh we can we
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.480]   We don't have to work on the weekends anymore, you know
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.040]   But but google from the beginning was always a very polite very consensus driven place
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.600]   You'd occasionally have you know somebody would would get into a rumble
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.320]   But it was very rare and people would apologize and try to make way for everybody else's feelings
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:32.000]   So um, it's interesting to read how amazon of course you got a lot of hard working people
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.960]   But also this uh, you know and maybe microsoft has a little bit as well people will sort of
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.400]   Have it out a little bit or try to come to the right
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.520]   Decision through so so credit discussion or maybe arguments or or maybe you know, uh kind of verbal combat
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.200]   but um
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.880]   I sort of I've talked to a few amazon employees and and I think there might be a kernel of truth in the new york time story
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.360]   But I think a larger part of it might also be that there's probably a trend in which
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.080]   You know, uh probably a few years ago
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.200]   Some of the things in the new york times article might have held more true
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:13.280]   But it sounds like amazon has been trying to do better about not burning out their employees and just churning through people and having people stay for
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.920]   A year or two or three and then leave so you know, it's it's like the uh parable of the blind man all touching an elephant
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.720]   And they're all to seem different or they're all touching different parts
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:30.160]   You know one touches the task and one touches the the scales and so they all are sort of it's too big for any one person to necessarily
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.200]   uh to understand completely
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:42.960]   One thing I want to um mention because we talked about the story on sunday's well on twit is that the amazon employee
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.880]   uh nik chubitario who wrote the linked in piece
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:53.440]   Uh saying i've never seen any of this said in the piece that I tried to say this in a comment in the time story
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:58.080]   And I would the comment was moderated out which sounded like a smoking gun frankly
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.040]   Well, did you see well so so market Sullivan addressed that exactly
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.400]   Go ahead and it was a ridiculous response. I thought because he's saying that well he just he just said a little bit
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.760]   Then linked to his piece. I don't know if that's the case. I think I kind of understand that
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.200]   Um
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.560]   Bassi ate him who is in charge of the comment moderation said
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.520]   Mostly was just a link to his piece
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.840]   With it all the time leo
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.600]   I do that all the time where i'll see something on facebook and somebody will say I just did it yesterday
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.760]   It was really about the facebook piece somebody said well, but but facebook
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.800]   Um roger black a big designer says about facebook. I said well here roger here's what I had to I yeah
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.440]   I thought that it first too, but I ended up changing my mind. Here's what I had to say boom click and link
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.400]   Why should I reproduce the entire thing there?
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.800]   Yeah, I think that's a we know this is the
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.920]   They said it may be more of a policy
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.480]   And you could debate the policy
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:50.400]   They said if there had been a substantial commentary that with the link it would have been posted
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.720]   I said that that fundamentally misunderstands the architecture of the web
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:00.160]   And but as possible at the time did that I just I think the point is that you can't impute it to
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.720]   malevolence or
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.760]   plant
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.000]   An old-fashioned thinking but but certainly you can impute it to just not getting it
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.320]   Yeah, somebody should have somebody should have clicked on that link as a news judgment
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.240]   You should have clicked on that as a news judgment and said oh man people will want to read this
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:21.200]   In fact, I would argue that at least digitally you don't just leave it in the comment you put it up the top saying wow
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.920]   Here's some important stuff that happens so the time has came back today
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:29.280]   And they did another follow-up piece quoting from from comments on their site
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.080]   And I think also at hacker news where there was a huge discussion so on but again it was front loaded completely with
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.200]   Slams lambs lambs lambs lambs lambs. Oh by the way a few good things
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.480]   Yeah
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:44.000]   And it really just doesn't look good for the journalism of the times and that is what it sets me because I think the story
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.600]   I think that's right there are kernels in there that I fully believe
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.960]   Um, but I don't think it for six months on a hundred interviews and all that it wasn't diligent enough in its journalism
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:01.520]   Well good news according to the onion jeff bezos assures amazon employees that hr will be working
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.040]   100 hours a week to address their complaints
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.680]   So that's a relief
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.680]   They're taking this very seriously
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.280]   The kicker too
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:17.440]   Yeah, jeff says I heard your grievances. I promise hr is to handling 16 hours a day plus weekends until the problem is solved
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:23.600]   Bezo says any employee not fully committed to ensuring a healthy work life balance should look for a job elsewhere
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   (Laughter)
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:36.080]   RHR staff will continue to work their fingers to the bone not seeing their families or friends or anything at all outside the offices for as long as it takes
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.760]   To make this right so I I feel like amazon's addressed this
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.280]   You know, I bet there's truth to both sides, but I also think it's a startup and that's not unusual
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.880]   It's just 10 year old startup 15 year old startup, but
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:55.120]   More power to jeff if he wants people to take it seriously and work as hard as they can
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.520]   um
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   Well matt if i'm prying
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.120]   Please, please tell me to go right away
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:09.920]   You work really really really really hard for the first few years anyway, well
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.760]   Sorry, so is this is this whole leave thing that leaves us all befuddled?
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.480]   Is that kind of trying to like a server reward? Yeah, it's what it's not just reward
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.600]   Is it also kind of say try to re reset your balance?
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:32.320]   Uh, I am trying to recalibrate a little bit because uh, you know whenever we I went from grad school straight to google
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.800]   And at the time my my girlfriend we I got married three weeks before I joined google
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.560]   You know my wife and I agreed let's try google for four or five years
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.360]   And at some point you turn around and it's been 14 14 and a half 15 years ago like
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:51.600]   Okay, yeah, that's that's not work-life balance. That's work work work work work and no light and no balance
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.200]   And so it is an attempt to try to get a little bit better balanced that way
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.000]   What you're also seeing by the way is the is the university heritage of google
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.800]   You jeff you know about sabbaticals universities do this routinely after seven years. I'm gonna you're wrong. Don't look. Yeah
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:10.160]   Wait, you probably way overdue for your sabbatical. I am
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.880]   um in fact zif davis had sabbatical part of policy as well after
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   Uh, I think it was after seven years you get a year to pursue whatever you want
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.440]   Wow
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.960]   And I thought that was really good. I mean they try to encourage you to pursue maybe it wasn't a year
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:32.000]   Maybe i'm inflating it, but they encourage you to pursue something that will make you a better employee when you return
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.240]   paid
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.240]   Yeah, I think it was paid
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.480]   Sabbaticals are paid right yeah, yeah
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.320]   So I mean ours are if I if I do it I think for a year i'm paid at not a full right
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.360]   Great, but that's the genesis of that. That's a very common thing in universe in academia
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:56.480]   Am is marshmallow m is for the many things she it's marshmallow
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.640]   Was to me does that mean anything that that it's marshmallow? It means that they didn't get a deal with mars bars
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.720]   What does it mean nothing
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:09.120]   Nothing it means that's the name. Oh, but we did see this
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.520]   Does it well how important are those statues on the Elan at google? Is that something everybody pays attention to?
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.520]   I bet you an email circulates
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.320]   They're putting the statue up tomorrow. I think people
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:26.560]   They enjoy it. Yeah, they they have a lot of fun with the marshmallow and all the other statues that they do
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.240]   I have to say my favorite part of uh android m is the app permissions because
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.000]   For the first time you don't have to pre-approve a big laundry list of stuff
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.480]   Not knowing what the app is going to do and whether you can trust the app instead you can start to say
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.280]   You know open the app and then it wants if it wants to know your location you can choose at that point
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:52.160]   Yeah, and if if you say no, then they have to decide how to get around or not get around but how to deal with that back
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.360]   And uh, and so it's just a much better permission model. Hopefully
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.520]   You know every every app developer should be paying attention to this and uh working on getting ready for the new emery niece
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.440]   One of the that's one of the weird things about this one plus two and the lollipop
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.080]   Uh, it's pretty pure
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.960]   511 but there is a section in the settings app permissions. So they're taking a page from
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.440]   uh android six
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.040]   And they do warn you and you know if you turn on this is this is the you know
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.440]   Unapproved version, but you can turn off
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.160]   Some of these permissions they say it may break the app but you go have at it
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:33.280]   Here's here's the marshmallow video the statue revealed people does this
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.360]   every uh
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.800]   Every update
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.800]   There's cupcake. There's kit cat
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:45.280]   There's something under a a beautiful by the way last time when they did this with kit cat didn't we see the nexus six
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.920]   Look carefully. That's right. Somebody somebody. That's right. That's right carefully
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.760]   There's the
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.200]   It's a little robot with a marshmallow now. I mean take a look at the marshmallow and then the body of the android
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.160]   It's so could have easily been the body of the android
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   Why not miss the opportunity?
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:08.640]   Yeah, I know maybe it could be holding a bowl of little marshmallows. What's what's the marshmallow man in uh ghost monsters?
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:16.720]   Stay puffed. Oh, it should have been the same. He did an android man dressed up as stay puffed. Oh, that one perfect. Yeah
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.200]   Or an android would probably get mission for whoever own ghost monsters though, like right so many years something
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.800]   It does be a perfect time for the new chatroom. It's interesting
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.640]   Uh jito says that it's interesting at 6.0 and not 5.2 right?
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.320]   What does that say? Does that mean uh, is that a major revision?
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.440]   As opposed to a minor revision
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.800]   It either means a lot or absolutely nothing right?
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.920]   I'm not sure but I mean, you know what what you said mad as far as the permissions
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.040]   Uh asked really that's a pretty significant change
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.880]   So i'm sure that's kind of part of it
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.480]   But yeah, we were talking about this last night on all about android about how the major point updates in in
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:03.120]   You know previous history seem to be tied to very obvious visual changes to the android o s
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.000]   And this time and then the the incremental changes seem to be like refining on the underneath
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.280]   I like this is a little bit different than that, but personally, I mean if you're rolling out a major update a year
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:19.520]   Why not just bump it up a version like you know, it's it's less confusing that way. What would you know?
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.680]   What would win those two next year seven? I don't know
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.960]   Yeah, you can skip a number just arbitrarily for no reason
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:29.680]   Make people just go to 10 everybody's on 10 these days. Let's just jump to 10
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:36.640]   I'm looking there's a lot of uh, it looks like there's some nexus sixes in five cases. That's a five case right there
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.000]   Uh that looks like an lg
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:43.120]   That's an iphone clearly another iphone
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:48.240]   There's of course. We don't even know if these are all google there are they all google employees or
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:54.320]   Or they just could be random people in math view. I don't know. Yeah, I've I've I've played juris with
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.040]   Yeah, I wouldn't want to miss it. Are you kidding? That's a great uh to all of phones. Uh, I
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.840]   I don't see a new phone. Okay
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.240]   We do have uh leaked
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.920]   leak nexus five stuff
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.720]   But it's uh only a leak
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:18.320]   You probably talked about I don't want to repeat too much of what you did on all about andry because you do such a good job with andra
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:23.280]   Thanks. We're not just android. We have other things we can talk about. Yeah
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:28.320]   Yes, we are we are seeing plenty of nexus leaks whether they are real or not
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.960]   Remains to be seen but we're totally in nexus leak territory and calendar
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.920]   Is your advice to jeff to not get one of these other new phones but to hold out?
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:46.800]   I don't know you can always wait like you can wait forever. I guess is my advice as far as that's concerned
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.960]   One of my great skills there. Yeah, no exactly. Um, you know, so if if you feel the need to buy something right now
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.480]   Hey, guess what? There's a lot of really good stuff. I don't need right now perfectly good wonderful make there was some foam right here
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.800]   That's great. I do what my father. I want to do that. Yeah, but I
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.920]   Just be here's the thing if I if I went out and I spent because the other problem I have is I think to test a lot of things
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.720]   I bought, you know, my iPod
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.360]   Nano
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.080]   That's ridiculous. Well, and I can't do something. Yeah, you gotta get an iPhone
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.360]   I have my old iPhone is not the way but I know I don't want an iPhone
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.160]   Get an iPhone because you're gonna get on google. I'm in facebook mentions
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.960]   And then you want to stream pictures of your kitty
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.680]   I don't use it
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.840]   so
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.800]   I'm excited about the Moto X. So that's coming out September 3rd
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.240]   That might be a question is do I buy so so but then if I and they'll be able to use five with it, right?
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.120]   Yeah, three night. No, you can't use five without well. We don't know
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:49.040]   We don't even know if the next five will be five compatible. Yeah, I'm sure the new nexus is I would have to imagine
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.160]   They're why I do that, but maybe they don't want that many customers. Maybe not maybe not they were true
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.960]   A good way to make sure you're your new service that you're really excited about doesn't go anywhere
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.880]   But what do you think about Comcast's watchable platform? Jeff?
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.520]   Hey
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:12.720]   Comcast has decided it's going to launch a major video platform called watchable to rival facebook and google
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.680]   One little difference you have to have a Comcast cast x1 cable set top box to watch it
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.360]   Cheese, so it's not it's not on the internet
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.680]   Well, but they only ask you this is this is a platform you want to be on
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.600]   I would imagine well, I you know, I love our shows to be everywhere in fact. We're on tvo people can use tvo to get it
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:39.120]   Um, so yeah, I mean if they call me and say would you like to be on here? I'd say yes, but it's not
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:42.640]   The thing is if it's not on the internet is it important?
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.440]   Did you see the most recent statistics on cord cutting? Whoa?
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.800]   It is not good for these evermind michael wolf who says television the new television
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.200]   Let me see if I can find there it is that's the graph
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.760]   um this
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.000]   This is from a business insider the scariest chart in the history of cable
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.680]   Uh cable tv subscribers are actually plummeting
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.800]   Especially in the last year
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.880]   It's suddenly gone the year to your growth has suddenly gone negative as of the fourth quarter 2014
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.280]   Uh, this is this is not good. It is it is a down down down and i'm just kind of surprised
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.720]   Because there's no real financial advantage to cord cutting in the long run. It seems like you'd have to pay
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.520]   A lot for internet access plus, you know channel by channel access
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.400]   but boy people just
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.640]   Penitra hassle penetration of cable down from 88 in 2010 to
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.160]   Uh 80 in the last quarter
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.320]   So so google's attacked this this horrible business model with fiber
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.840]   If you look at business models that are that are based on imprisonment the other thing I want is google air
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.480]   By that I mean an airline
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.320]   Really?
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.040]   Yo, i'd kill for it because they treat us decently
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.840]   They figure out that we have value we're valuable people in there. We have information and there's other things
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.840]   Um, uh, I wrote about googly airline and what will google do
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.480]   Uh, but I think that the the cable business is also just we resent it so much
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.200]   Given the chance to escape. I think that's what a lot of this is. It's not safe money. It's just I hate you
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.600]   Just hate them. Yeah
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.240]   Uh, and wearable is their response. Well, what if we
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.000]   What if uh, your set top box had video on it
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.720]   They are going to give content creators 70% of ad revenue
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:50.960]   But uh, that's taking a bigger chunk than we give so that's the problem i'd have with it
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.520]   And I bet you they wouldn't let us put our own ads on there, right?
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:59.120]   Ooh, right here's a couple of short good news some happy news
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.200]   Uh, the fcc is finding
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.600]   um
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.160]   Smart city which does the wifi at?
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.360]   Conventions smart city which charges $80 a day
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:20.400]   To get wifi at a convention had been blocking personal mobile hotspots to force you to use their wifi
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.720]   Fcc said that's a no no
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.560]   $750,000 fine. It's the second time they've done this remember
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.440]   They went after mariot for doing the same thing and reached a $600,000 settlement
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.160]   Uh for doing kind of the same thing interrupting. Uh, why uh,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.520]   Wifi at uh, their conference facilities in nashville the fcc has said why
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.640]   Unequivocally wifi blocking is prohibited. You may not block
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.360]   wifi
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.160]   Uh, well, uh, according to smart city. We always acted a good faith
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.200]   We had no prior notice the fcc considered the use of this
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.680]   Standardized available out of the box technology to be a violation of its rules
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.600]   $80 a day
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:11.600]   Just just evil true fark. I mean, sorry true curtis the uh creator of fark
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.520]   And a good friend of uh of mine and uh he used to be on the uh tech tv on a regular basis
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.200]   Is running for governor of kentucky and he made the ballot
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.240]   It's very clear
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:31.280]   It's kind of like having moop be presently three people on the ballot in kentucky. Yeah, he has a fellow kentucky and so i'm really
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.640]   Oh really you are and uh, you know, so he's actually gonna
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.520]   Yeah, I I grew up in eastern kentucky, you know and uh and
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.800]   Uh drew is a governor scholar and i'm a kentucky governor scholar and so uh, you know
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.600]   We we talk about isn't it great that leery does all this great stuff and serge and you know larry
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.800]   Ellison do all this great stuff, but I think it's really cool to realize that
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:59.680]   Everyday regular tech entrepreneurs and you know concerned citizens can can actually make a pretty big difference too
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:03.920]   And so drew is on the ballot. So he's got five thousand signatures
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:09.280]   He's been certified by the secretary of state or whoever and uh, he will be in the next debate
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.040]   And so you know in case you think that you can't make a difference
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.000]   He's registered as an independent and his he's actually polling
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.840]   Pretty well considering that he hasn't even really started any advertising yet
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.320]   So it's it's pretty exciting if you're a kentucky and you might go check it out. Tell your friends about it
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.960]   Let's uh, let's see if we can get a tech savvy governor going, you know, uh, that's so great
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.240]   It is so wonderful at curtis for governor if you want to follow the twitter account of the campaign
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:41.440]   And uh drew curtis.com and this site is drew curtis.nationbuilder.com where he's doing the fundraising
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.960]   I guess heathers his wife. I don't know. She's running for lieutenant governor
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.160]   Maybe they just maybe just have the same name. I don't know. I'm pretty sure that must be his wife
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.040]   This is up there with kinky freedman running for the governor of texas. Yeah
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.680]   Yeah
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.680]   But I don't think this is a joke
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.280]   Drew's very serious about this so good for you drew. So that's a happy one
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.400]   um
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.800]   And another happy one, uh, because we are big fans of jerry ellison
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.040]   She's been here many times showing off jerry ellsworth. I'm sorry showing off her
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:18.800]   Really interesting inventions. She's always stopping by to show us pinball games and things
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:23.200]   You may remember the last time she was here. She showed us a really cool augmented reality system
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.920]   Cast ar she had developed it
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.800]   At steam when she was working there
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.600]   She told the story of how uh when she and her partner
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.720]   uh, were told that
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.760]   uh
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.520]   By uh, gabenull that the steam was going to kill the project jerry
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.080]   She's very gutsy said
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.440]   Well, can I have it and gabes said yeah
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.080]   So they spun it out. They just took it off. They started a cast ar
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.760]   Really cool originally called technical illusions
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.160]   Uh jerry and rick were here rick johnson were here to her partner. We're here to show it off
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.360]   We should dredge that up because they've just received a very significant investment
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.680]   Not just money but support from andy rubin
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.240]   former android and you know guy the guy who created android
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.360]   Joined to google when google bought android and only recently moved on from google
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.600]   he's invested 15 million dollars, but
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.720]   jerry and rick are quick to say it's a lot more than that when you got andy rubin saying
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.360]   This is a real technology. This is a gonna take off
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.080]   That is important
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.480]   So nice work jerry. We're very very happy. There you go. That's me
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.320]   Trying a pro very early prototype glue gun prototype
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.840]   Of the cast arag goggles
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.440]   Yeah
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.760]   A r so what happens is you have to put down a
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:55.840]   Uh a special screen and you can see 3d games on it 3d jenga you can it
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:02.720]   It's very cool and you still see the world around you and unlike microsoft's uh holland's you have a full field of view
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.080]   Uh the key the game is on this piece of uh on this is on this fabric
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.400]   What you're seeing is not anywhere near what it looked like to me. It was very vivid to me
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:18.400]   Uh, that's uh triangulation episode 124. Wow almost two years ago now
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.360]   Good job jerry
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.320]   I love jerry alsworth
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.120]   I'm really glad she's doing well
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:33.200]   And uh, you know what I I uh bookmarked this because I just think this is an important article to read
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:40.160]   By matthew green who is one of the great crypto guys. He's really become I think matthew in many ways has become the voice
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.640]   Of crypto and security
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.880]   Uh, he's at john's hopkins
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.960]   Uh, and this uh in the light of the article
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.280]   Uh that was published by pro publica and the new york times about how
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:50:00.560]   Happy and willing att was to cooperate with the national security agency and giving information including
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040]   wire tapping the entire uin
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.840]   for the nsa
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.840]   um
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.840]   He wrote a really good blog post saying you know what the network is hostile
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:19.360]   Anyone who has taken a network security class he writes knows the first rule of internet security is there is no
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.960]   internet
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.160]   Security there's only one solution. We've said this time and time again end-to-end encryption, but that's hard
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.320]   And even if you do achieve 100 encryption
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.280]   metadata leaks a lot of information
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:36.720]   so, um
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:41.920]   You know, he says this this nsa 18t story yet another snowden revelation
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.800]   We kind of knew this didn't we and
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.120]   It you know, he says if you believe that uh
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:55.600]   Someday a large portion of the world's traffic will flow through government networks not just our own but china and other
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.280]   governments
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.880]   And some of those governments hostile to the core values of western democracy
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:08.320]   Uh, then the answer isn't going to involve legislation or politics the nsa won't protect us through cyber retaliation
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:16.000]   If you're concerned about the future the answer is to finally truly believe our propaganda about network trust we need to learn to build systems today
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.600]   That can survive such an environment
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.960]   It's good article highly recommended. Matthew green's blog is on blogger
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:29.920]   blog.cryptographyengineering.com the network is hostile. He wrote it on sunday
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.520]   Let's take a break
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.920]   and uh when we come back
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:43.200]   tips tools tricks ideas thoughts i'll give you a little tour of the uh, one plus two i finally got it all
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.760]   set up and running

[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:03.920]   Intelligent living if you've dabbled with home automation that passed, you know
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:08.960]   Not just expensive but frankly complicated each system as it's is proprietary
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:12.400]   Each with their own user experience you end up having dozens of different apps
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:18.000]   On your phone for your lights and your locks and your garage and everything else
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.720]   Smart things changes all that the smart things hub
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.120]   Is a centralized hub that controls lights lock security
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:31.120]   Through a single app whether on a ios or android or windows phone. It's an open platform
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:40.560]   So they have their own sensors lots of them, but they also work with connected devices from many other companies including drock drop cam schleglocks
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.120]   honeywell thermostats
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.680]   editor's choice award at ces this year

[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.120]   slash twig
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.960]   So
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.280]   Anything cool in your life matt cuts
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.640]   You know, I had a very strange experience recently which was my niece
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.720]   Came up to me and she said matt
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.520]   I want to write an app
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:52.560]   And I was like, oh man, I really haven't prepared for this
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.400]   And so the tip or the tool that I would recommend is app inventor too
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:00.160]   So if you just search for app inventor, it's it's uh started at google
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.120]   But now it's at mit and they're doing a fantastic job with it
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.600]   And I didn't realize this but
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:10.320]   You can now do it where you can make a draw a drag and drop app and it works pretty well
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:16.480]   And you can install the app on an android phone using a helper app and you don't actually have to you know
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.160]   If you're like me, you might have tried to set it up with android studio and java and you know
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.200]   adb and all these kinds of things and I spent like three days trying to get the environment just right too
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:33.680]   Instead now in less than an hour. I had a little tiny app, you know, it's a button
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.000]   You know, which she put a German shepherd on it and you can say pet the dog and
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.520]   Oh, that's cute
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.400]   So android app inventor has this thing
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.080]   It's called hello per and they start with a cat and it and it you know
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.760]   Sort of meows whenever you press this button, which is a picture of a cat and she changed it to a dog because she likes German shepherds
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.120]   And so, you know in less than an hour. We were sitting together
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.600]   I did the first little bit to make sure it worked and then she took over and changed the dog
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.240]   You know the cat pictures and meow to a dog picture in a bark
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.520]   And it's it's pretty incredible. It's so gratifying
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.760]   You know, she was like showing it to people and she was
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.320]   Planning what her next app was going to be and I was just like I could just feel like Gina
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.320]   Japani just like shot, you know smiling
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:19.920]   Spelling as we say it was
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.760]   You know when we grew up it was all Commodore 64s and go to and peak and poke and now kids want to write an app
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.000]   And so app inventor is a great little way to start trying to do that. That's great
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.160]   I want uncle matt too
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:35.120]   You want to see how easy it is to do because I actually wrote
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.840]   I just like you matt except this was for me
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.800]   I wanted to write a countdown timer for my radio show
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.680]   I'd written one before an apple script and I thought it'll be good to have it on a uh a mobile app
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.960]   And uh, so I wrote it what you do is you design as you know you design the user interface
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.520]   First you're in the designer and then you go over to blocks and you write your code
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.760]   There's your code
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:05.120]   And uh, it's very easy. Yeah, give me the time, but it's very easily. I'll show you how to so you get the app inventor app on your
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:09.760]   The companion app on your android device and then you can connect it. So I'm gonna say
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.080]   uh connect
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:17.360]   To the ai companion and it gives you a qr code. I'm gonna enter in that code
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.040]   Right now. I'm gonna know if I should show this on the air is this gonna is this gonna everybody gonna be
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.440]   Solv using my app now. I don't know
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.560]   Now, uh, I can scan the qr code or I can now let's scan it here make it easy
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:34.480]   And then it's entering the code and then let's connect
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.120]   And now app inventor on the screen
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.920]   When what is what's cool about that? So there's the app and then if you make a change to the app and immediately
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.960]   Changes on your um phone
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.960]   Wow
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.920]   So you get instant feedback, you know, I'm I'm actually this is the app here running
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:00.640]   On my device because I tied the two together. That's a pretty simple app and it's not gonna let you to write, you know, the next
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:05.360]   Gmail inbox, but it's gonna it gives you some some real capabilities
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.560]   What this one does is it knows what time it is it knows how many seconds are left before my commercial break
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.600]   And it can it reminds me it blinks in front of me
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.560]   During the radio show when I should shut up you'll see in about 10 seconds. It's gonna blink
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:26.960]   Yellow at me saying you've only got 30 seconds left and then it blinks red saying you got 10 seconds left and then just says shut up
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:34.160]   It's very it's very easy. You're absolutely right man easy enough that a kid can get great satisfaction out of it right away
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:36.960]   And for a kid to see the to see these things running
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.400]   Um is uh, you know, so quickly and easily is really exciting for them
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:48.080]   Well, even a year or two ago it was pretty wild because you know, you'd have to plug in the usb
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.560]   Quad and you have to do a lot of installation
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:53.360]   Yeah, and now the fact that you can do qr codes
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:58.160]   Yeah, just makes it so much easier and the gratif gratification is right there and for me
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:02.800]   That's the main thing is it's enough to get them hooked where they're like, oh, I want to do that a little bit more
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.080]   Commercial breaks over we are now in the show and I went green
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.960]   And that's how many seconds before the next commercial break and so it's it's very simple, but boy
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.280]   Actually, this is really incredibly useful
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.520]   It's really fantastic. The other thing I love about you can see the plug and play
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:23.600]   Uh in your face. It's fairly simple to learn and this is how a lot of programming environments for kids work scratch
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.320]   um, you know, uh, alice
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:30.320]   Uh, so they get they're gonna see this in school too these kinds of
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:34.320]   Modules and this really there's a lot of them. I agree with you. This is just a
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.160]   Really fantastic tool even for grownups
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:46.720]   Yeah totally free, you know, I was like she had an she had an iphone and I was like, oh, do I have to pay $99 so she can write an
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:51.440]   App but instead, you know in under an hour. She's happy. Oh, this works on an iphone too
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.800]   Well, I think this only works on android, but I was I thought about what do you have to do to write?
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:01.360]   And it's a lot harder on an iphone. There's nothing like this. Yeah, unless you jailbreak your ios
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.640]   Right now. This is really neat and yeah, it was developed at google
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:07.840]   So concudos to google and thank you mit for taking it over and I know
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   There are a lot of curricula, uh school clerk curricula that use this as a teaching tool. It's really good
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.040]   Jeff you have a number for us?
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:23.200]   Uh, yes google wet public 11 years ago today. The stock is up over 1,500
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.840]   Do you remember that day matt?
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.840]   I do remember that day
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:30.560]   pretty well
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.560]   Yeah, um, you know
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.760]   But the nice thing is, you know, they did the Dutch auction so anybody could get in at the ipo price and it's gone up pretty
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:41.520]   Well since then so who's such innovators they even innovated on the ipo didn't they?
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.640]   Yeah
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.800]   Pretty close the other number on one is 30
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.520]   What's your 30 day challenge matt?
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.640]   Oh, uh, my 30 day challenge is uh, there's an article in the new york times about it
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:57.760]   Uh, it's called 30 2010 intervals you you run normally for 30 seconds
[01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.880]   And then you sort of jog a little faster for 20 and then you run full out as hard as you can for 10 seconds
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:06.720]   And then you loop back around you throw up and you do that and that's that's a five-minute cycle
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.200]   And then you do that three times so in like 15 minutes you get yourself a crazy hard, you know
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:16.320]   Your heart is just like pounding workout. Um, and so far this is not my favorite 30
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:23.360]   Even compared to cold showers. I'm not really a fan of this one so far, but it's okay
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.760]   No, they say this is the best intense
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:29.760]   Brief workouts are the way to do it. You want to really stress your body in effect
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:35.040]   Yes, high interval intense or high intensity interval training high intensity interval training
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:41.040]   There's an app that will do this for android from johnson and johnson of all people called the seven
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.400]   Minute workout that is the original high intensity
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:47.200]   Training so they it's seven minutes
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:51.200]   Of course you're supposed to do it like more than once, but you don't have to
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.640]   And uh, and it and it gives you the timers and tells you what to do and
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:59.760]   If you really want to make yourself sick
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.320]   Yeah, well, you know
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.200]   The point is it's not fun, but according to the studies it actually really really helps
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.040]   Interpreting cardio fitness and all sorts of stuff you can either run for two hours
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.720]   You can do 12 minutes of hell right and it turns out 12 minutes
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:16.880]   Even though you procrastinate is still better right?
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.160]   All that good stuff. Yeah, this app is free and I and I really like it. It's called. Uh, let's see. I think it's from
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.320]   self-med
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:29.360]   Uh, I literally count 210 three times and then I count to 10 two times
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.760]   And it's actually nice because then you count to 10, you know
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.720]   One more time and that's when you're doing full out
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.440]   And uh, it distracts you like 40 minute or 30 minute workout is done before you know it
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:44.080]   Uh, you just have to make sure you don't run so hard you give yourself shin splints or something as a result
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.680]   Right
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:48.800]   So uh, good good good. That's a good 30 day challenge
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.880]   Good
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:54.560]   Good. It's a good 30. It's a good. Yeah. Well, you you now
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.360]   What is your commitment to yourself? Do you if you say, you know after day 10? I'm done
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.560]   Do you have to like uh put money in a kitty or anything? What do you how do you punish yourself?
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:06.160]   Well
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:09.360]   If it's a normal challenge like you supposed to meditate and you miss a day
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:12.080]   I'll normally just tack that on to the end of the 30 day challenge
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.080]   So sometimes I'm doing a couple at once
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.800]   This one's weird because I I normally am a slow runner and I haven't really been doing
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.720]   All-out running and so I actually am kind of giving myself shin splints. So I'm like
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.320]   I this today. I did it as a bike instead of a run. So I just you know, I did it as as a biking
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.240]   You know, there's
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.400]   You can't take it too seriously. You gotta have a little bit of fun with it. So uh, my uh
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:41.360]   Tool is actually a couple of them and you probably have some ideas as I've been talking about it the entire show two new phones
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360]   Both came in the last couple of days
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:50.320]   I was a fan of the samsung note series from day one. I've had a alone every note the one two three four
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.880]   And now this is the samsung note
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.200]   five and uh
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.920]   There's some changes here first of all they've they've abandoned the crap plastic back
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:08.400]   For a glass back kind of like the iphone if you've if you played with the samsung galaxy s6 you'll recognize this immediately as being
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.320]   um just kind of a giant version of this
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.480]   It's 5.7 inches very high res screen
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.960]   The battery is smaller than the note
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.760]   For which worried me a lot and of course you're losing the SD card and removable battery
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:30.640]   Uh, that's kind of scary, but i've gotten so far pretty good battery life. You see I haven't I got up this morning at six a.m
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:37.200]   And here we are at local time 330 and it's 76 percent. So that's that's a good sign
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.640]   I'm getting I think about yesterday. I got about 16 hours. I think about 16 hours of battery life
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:45.040]   That's close to what I need to get
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:51.440]   Uh for me to consider a phone if a phone it only gets eight or nine hours and a lot of the latest crop of android phones do
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:57.680]   That eliminates it of course where this phone excels much like the galaxy
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.240]   S6 is in the camera. It is easily the best camera this and the s6 same same camera ois
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:05.680]   um
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:07.360]   16 megapixels
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:11.680]   Incredible this one adds one little feature it shoots raw as well in the pro mode. So
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:14.480]   Uh, this is this is the camera phone
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.440]   Uh that uh if you're serious about a camera phone photography. This is the one
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.920]   Also shoots 4k video, which the new iphone is rumored to do this one already does it's
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:26.240]   This is a beast
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:31.680]   Um, and I so far I really really like it fast. It doesn't have the hesitance that the s6
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.200]   Edge kind of started getting a little laggy for me
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.000]   Um probably because it has four gigs of RAM
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.280]   Um, so that's the note five i've a full review uh soon on before you buy and then today
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:49.120]   Uh, this is a embarrassment of riches. This is the new one plus two
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:54.800]   Which Jason also got kind of similar to the old one plus two no nfc, which is weird
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:58.640]   Uh battery not removable no sd card
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:04.480]   I got the 64 gig of version and as usual you have to get through an invite process to get it
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:11.440]   Uh, we were lucky thanks to jeff that uh, we both got the invites jeff picked up a couple in the line at the announcement event
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:17.040]   Screen it you immediately see is not nearly as good as the oled screen on the uh
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:24.320]   On the uh galaxy note for I mean the note four has the easily you know the s6 and the note four have the best screens
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.560]   Enough five I should say have the best screens on the market. They're just stunning oled screens
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:34.480]   This is only 1080p. It's not quad hd. It's uh lcd. I think it's ips
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:38.240]   It's a little feels a little washed out frankly the black sarn is black the whites aren't as white
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.120]   Uh on the other hand if I get better battery life and I expect to I got 20 hours on the one plus one
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.840]   I expect to get similar battery life on the one plus two that may make up for it good fingerprint reader
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.400]   Uh really like that
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:56.800]   So and it's a lot less. This is half as much as the note five. It's only uh, it's under 400 bucks
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.440]   That's there's a lot to be said for
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:05.280]   Uh that on the other hand, uh, you may end up buying another one because support is almost non-existent
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.200]   For the one plus they do I maybe they're they say they're gonna try to do better this time around
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:13.760]   But the one plus one a lot of people have trouble with the one plus one were very unhappy with the support on that
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:18.960]   I forgot there's one other feature that makes the note five if the no five battery life is decent
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:23.200]   I'm gonna stick with the no five. I think watch this the screens off. That's a cool pen
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.880]   I don't know if you're gonna be able to see this or not, but I can still
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:31.600]   Yeah, we see that right on the black screen
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:36.000]   And save it. I haven't turned it on. I just popped the pen
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.720]   Um also, I don't know if you know but notice but the latency is zero
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:46.960]   So some some pen phones have not been great because you know, there's a little lag
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:52.400]   There's no lag here and I can save that up and now I have that note for future reference
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:58.080]   That's really cool because if you know you're you're in a bar and you meet an attractive young person and you say
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:05.840]   Let me get your number why you just pop that out and you can write five five five five one two one two
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:08.480]   And you know the napkin will never get wet
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:11.600]   You will always
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.720]   Have that number although you may shed a tear when you realize it's the number of the local directory assistance
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.080]   Not hers
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:21.840]   Uh, so that's kind of a nice kind of a tip for actually medicine usually

[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:49.440]   And I'm not a I'm not gonna repeat it. I don't like a locker
