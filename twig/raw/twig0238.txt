[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.160]   We have a very interesting conversation coming up.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.880]   When Comcast got Netflix to pay a little more money for access to Comcast customers,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.440]   I thought that was a violation of net neutrality.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.760]   Turns out the story is a lot more complicated.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.600]   We've got an expert who's going to explain all and a whole lot more coming up on Twig.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   Netcasts you love.

[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers at Google, but not just Google,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.800]   the cloud, the Googleverse, the Twitter, the Facebook, the WhatsApp and all of that.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.640]   Joining me right now, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   He is at the City University of New York where he's a professor of journalism.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.840]   My lights just went off and I have to do the dance.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040]   There we go.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   Because economy, economizing is so important in a state school.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.080]   Jeff is also the author of Public Parts and what will Google do and Gutenberg the Geek
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.720]   and we love having them on the show each week.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.600]   I have unfortunate news.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840]   Gina Trapani has the day off.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.000]   She's working on Think Up, had some stuff to do on Avoidleboro.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.040]   Oh, dare she have a job.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.480]   But I have very good news from Giga, oh, Matthew Ingram is joining us.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   So it's nice that you could be here.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.360]   Matthew, we appreciate it.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.080]   And then I wanted to point out an article or a blog post actually I read on the streaming
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.480]   media blog, streamingmediablog.com about how pretty much everybody who covered the Netflix
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   Comcast story got it wrong.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   The author Dan Rayburn is an analyst at Frost and Sullivan.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.560]   He's an EVP at streamingmedia.com which is a magazine, an online site and also a conference
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.080]   throws conferences on streaming media.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.320]   And this blog post really raked everyone over the coals, Tech Crunch, Wall Street Journal,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.000]   NPR, for not understanding the Netflix Comcast deal.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.360]   And most of us, and I'm going to include myself in this, treated it as Comcast squeezing Netflix
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.040]   for access to Comcast customers.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.640]   And as data points, for instance, Netflix offers an open connect system which many other
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.440]   ISPs, including Google, are members of that give direct access to Netflix data to those
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.000]   ISPs and their customers at no charge.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   And that Comcast had been, well, I shouldn't say it this way, that Netflix had noticed
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.120]   a drop of streaming speeds of 27% since October on Comcast.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.700]   As a Comcast customer, I had really noticed that Netflix became almost unusable on Comcast.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.440]   Some had even said, and there were some data points to demonstrate it, that Comcast was
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.680]   actively blocking Netflix in violation of their agreement with the FCC.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920]   So Dan, where did we get it wrong?
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.240]   Well, in every respect.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.440]   It's a confusing topic.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.640]   The thing that people don't understand is, and it's understandable they don't get it
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.960]   because they're not from the industry or the networking spaces.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   People are using a lot of terms like transit, peering, interconnection, CDN.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.080]   They don't really understand how it all connects with one another.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.440]   Who's responsible for paying whom?
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.080]   And that's where the big breakdown here is.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.400]   The other thing is Netflix is currently delivering video to ISPs using three different types
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.360]   of CDN networks using all different types of providers in that ecosystem.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.880]   So the easiest way to think about it is that Netflix has a lot of options for delivering
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   video to the ISP.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.300]   The ISP itself, Comcast, Verizon, whoever it may be, does not control how Netflix sends
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.880]   that traffic to their network.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.960]   What they do historically is they use middlemen who are called transit providers.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.240]   So you've read a lot about Cogent.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   Cogent is a transit provider.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.080]   So the way it works very simply is Netflix has their own servers that are sitting in third-party
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.960]   co-location facilities.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.240]   They buy transit.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.360]   They pay Cogent for that transit.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.040]   And Cogent gives Netflix a guaranteed level of quality.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.320]   Cogent then goes to level three and says, "We want to connect to your network for free."
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.280]   Level three, sorry, Comcast will let them connect for free under what's called settlement-free
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   pairing.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.080]   However, all transit providers have to abide by the pairing policy that that ISP has.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.160]   So if you go to comcast.com/piering, you can see Comcast's pairing policy.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.720]   Comcast treats Cogent just like any other transit provider.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   When the transit provider wants to send more traffic than the pairing policy allows, that
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.960]   transit provider has to pay for it.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.120]   However, Comcast has been very adamant, and their CEO still to this day is going out and
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.720]   saying, "We should not have to pay."
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.480]   It's interesting to know that Cogent has also had eight or nine of her other public disputes
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.600]   like this over transit with ISPs, but other transit providers haven't.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.640]   So it's really an issue of where Cogent is trying to push everything to Comcast and blame
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.960]   Comcast and Comcast basically has cut Cogent out of the deal, gone to a mutual interconnect
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.600]   agreement with Comcast directly.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   So it's Comcast and Netflix directly, cutting out Cogent, which does two things.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.760]   It increases the quality for consumers and it lowers Netflix cost.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.080]   So I think one of the things that people assumed is that this was bad for, this is an anti-net
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.320]   neutrality agreement because I think the assumption is that Comcast squeezed Netflix and made
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   them pay more than they would have otherwise.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.120]   And I think many of us feel like, "Well, I pay Comcast, shouldn't my access to Netflix
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.840]   be the same as everything else?"
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.960]   Is Comcast next going to ask YouTube for money or?
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.160]   Well, they've already cut those deals.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.520]   So a lot of people in the media said, "This is the first time a deal like this has been
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   done.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   It's actually inaccurate."
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.880]   Back in '98 and '99, we were covering in the market when guys like AOL and Yahoo were
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.200]   cutting deals like this with ISPs.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.680]   So Microsoft cuts these types of deals, Google cuts these types of deals, AOL does, Yahoo
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.680]   does.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.840]   This isn't new by any sense in the means.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.720]   Also keep in mind, what you're paying your ISP for, you're paying your ISP for that last
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   mile piece to the internet.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.480]   However, the ISP does not control the content that's coming into their network, the content
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.640]   owner or CDN controls that.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   So Netflix controls where they ingested into the ISP's network, which transit provider
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.680]   they use, how many different links they connect, what the quality of services with that transit
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.040]   provider, and what they're willing to pay.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.000]   Now an interesting thing to note here is if you have an Apple TV box and you're on Comcast,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   you don't have a problem.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   Why is that?
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.800]   The reason is that Level 3 and Limelight Networks, which are third party CDNs, are doing the
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   delivery of Netflix content specifically for the Apple TV box because Netflix has made
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.640]   the decision of how they get content to specific devices on specific networks.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   That's interesting.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.960]   So I can use Comcast on an Apple TV and get better Netflix?
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.720]   Yes, right.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.560]   And Comcast doesn't control that.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   Netflix controls it.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.320]   So people don't realize that Netflix is the one who controls this stuff.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.960]   So there are a couple of reasons that I believe the notion that Comcast was squeezing Netflix.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.900]   First of course, because Comcast is in the same business, they stream movies via stream
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.900]   picks.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.120]   So it made sense to me it might be an anti-competitive move.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:03.040]   But the other one is that Netflix offers this open connect CDN, which many ISPs are members
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   of but not Comcast.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.520]   They're not Verizon, by the way.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   Verizon's going to also--
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   And not AT&T.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   And not AT&T.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   Warner.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.840]   Why would Comcast not just do that?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.560]   Well, what people don't understand again about Open Connect.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   Open Connect is a program.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.680]   If you just Google Open Connect, you go to Netflix page.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.000]   Open Connect is a program where Netflix places servers that they own and operate inside the
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.640]   last mile of the ISP.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.880]   Now the idea is, OK, just the ISP should let us come in, place our own hardware in there,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.680]   let us control it, let us manage it, and it's completely free to the ISP.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.280]   It's not free to the ISP.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.880]   The ISP has to give you space, they have to give you power, they have to give you handoffs,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.720]   they have to give you engineering resources.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.360]   It's a direct cost to them.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.400]   Now guys like Google Fiber, Cable Vision, CenturyLink, they've agreed to Open Connect
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   because they feel it makes sense for the business model that they have.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   But keep having--
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.280]   The products they have for customers too.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   For their customers too.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.440]   Let's not forget them.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   Absolutely.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.240]   But Google Fiber has less than a million subs.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   Comcast has more than 20 million.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.960]   So we're comparing two completely different ISPs in terms of size and shape.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.920]   So each ISP has to look at what makes the most sense for them.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.200]   Do they want to connect via paid pairing?
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.360]   Do they want to do transit connections?
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.880]   Do they want to do third party CDNs to rack a myline light level three and edge cast?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.160]   Or do they want to do Open Connect?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   There's a lot of options in the market.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.720]   So Dan, can I ask you something?
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   Sure.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.200]   So let's say this particular arrangement doesn't actually have anything to do with net neutrality.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:45.080]   But it seems as though what got people was the sense that Comcast is becoming too powerful
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.720]   and its control over that last mile in so many places is too powerful and that customers
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.320]   are going to suffer or that the internet in general is going to suffer.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   What do you think of that?
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   Would you agree with that?
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.680]   Well, so here's what I've said quite a bit publicly for a long time is I'm a firm believer
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.920]   that more choice in the market is good for consumers when it comes to telecommunications
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   services and wire line services.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.240]   I mean, I've always seen from this industry from 15 years ago when we had more providers
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   in the space.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.080]   If you think of the days when real networks was around, real networks of Microsoft were
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.840]   battling it out over the video war.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.760]   And as a result, they added so many new improvements to their player and their platforms every
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   couple of months.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.960]   They were eager to outdo one another.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.720]   So I think it's better that we have more options in the market instead of less.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.560]   But now we're talking less about net neutrality and really talking about the whole time Warner
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   merger.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.680]   Well, and the duopoly that the FCC has foisted on the American public that most people in
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   the US can only get internet service from one cable company and one phone company.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   True.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480]   And there is no competition.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.000]   So Comcast, I'm a Comcast customer.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.120]   If I'm not happy, I don't have a choice.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   Right.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.880]   Which is, which is, it is one way or the other.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.280]   It does become a net neutrality argument in the broader sense.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.360]   This is what I'm arguing.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.120]   I sat in rooms in Silicon Valley way back in the day when at home argued for premium
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.760]   period arrangements.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.040]   And what was evident then, and is still evident now, is there is a moral hazard here.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.680]   And the moral hazard is those who pay me, those who do a deal with me, those who let
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.080]   me control will get better service.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.000]   And so the issue here isn't so much the specifics of this case.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.520]   The issue that I'm arguing is that FCC, you've got to step in and set principles.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.600]   And, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.560]   and well now we know that the FCC under Tom Wheeler isn't going to.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   That's the, that's what I fear.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   That's my problem with all this.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   That's why I say I keep out.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   Right.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   You're talking about a bigger picture.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.880]   I mean, the other interesting thing to note here is keep in mind that Netflix never had
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.320]   any quality of service issues of any kind until they decided to build their own CDN.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.560]   Why did they do that?
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.800]   When they were using Netflix limelight and level three and splitting traffic amongst
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.480]   all three providers for years, we didn't have these problems because the CDNs are already
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.720]   connected to the ISPs.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.240]   So what they do, that's their whole business.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:08.720]   So Netflix made a business decision to stop using third party CDNs, build their own servers,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.120]   get co-location space, buy transit.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   Why did they do that?
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.040]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:23.160]   Are you saying that among the ISPs who participate in Open Connect, there are QOS issues?
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   It's only on the ISPs who are not participating in Open Connect.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   Am I right?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.200]   No, because keep in mind, it's based on transit.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.800]   So if you're a content delivery network, thank Akamaire limelight, level three.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.760]   What you're doing is you're buying transit from multiple providers.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.960]   There's about 15 major transit providers out there.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.840]   You're probably buying transit from half of them.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.520]   And what you're doing is anytime there's an issue, in real time, you're watching the
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.320]   performance of that video, in real time, you are using multiple providers to get around
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.840]   any type of bottlenecks you have.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.640]   And that's why the CDNs really worked so well.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.560]   That's why Netflix and everybody else was using CDNs.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.000]   And today, everybody who doesn't build their own CDN is using third party CDN networks.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.880]   So Netflix decided they wanted to take more control and try and put servers inside the
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   last mile.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.400]   And in places like Europe, Open Connected really well.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.960]   In Europe, Netflix was able to stop using third party CDNs for almost all their video
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.560]   delivery, because the ISPs in Europe said, "Okay, you can come into our network and play
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   servers."
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.880]   In the US, the larger ISPs didn't go for that.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.440]   Well, they worked so much better in Europe.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.240]   Because they went for it.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.200]   There's no issue of transit if you're in the last mile.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.440]   There's no issue of transit.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   You're there.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.400]   You're delivering the content from the ISPs' own operation center.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.680]   Well, yes and no.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.360]   Well, sure, transit's not involved, but you still have QOS issues inside the last mile.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   Well, that's my question.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   Do you?
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.040]   That's why SLAs exist.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.400]   So you're saying that with Open Connected, they didn't solve the QOS issue?
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.800]   No, Open Connected not solve the QOS issue by itself.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   No.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.400]   Is that because they had to transit the information to the Open Connected servers in the...
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.600]   Well, so Open Connected is two different things.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.120]   Open Connected is a platform, but Open Connected is also...
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.400]   There's two ways to think of Open Connect.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.200]   It has their own servers running Open Connect platform, which are sitting in third-party
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.080]   data centers like Equinex, which are then connected to transit into ISPs.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   That's Open Connected.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.240]   But Open Connected is also the server with the software on it that goes inside a place
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.960]   like Google Fiber or Cablevision.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   Right.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.280]   And see the other story we're not talking...
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   Sorry, Matthew, go ahead.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.120]   Yeah, I just wondered, you asked the question, why did they build around?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.240]   Why do you think they built their own?
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.640]   I think primarily they wanted to have more control.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.240]   If you look back at what Netflix talked about, one of the VPs who really spearheads the whole
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:01.000]   content delivery in Netflix last year came to our show and did a 30-minute presentation,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   which I just posted on my blog yesterday.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   Yes, he's here.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   Explaining.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.520]   Here's what our approach is to the market.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.760]   Here's why we want to do it.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.960]   Also, this is the second time Netflix has tried to build their own CDN.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.320]   In 2007, they tried to build their own CDN.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.560]   They failed, and they went back to using CDN providers.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.920]   So this isn't the first time they've tried this and had problems.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.080]   My question is, do they fail because there's a technical issue?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.880]   Do they fail because Comcast and Verizon and others don't want them to succeed?
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.400]   Well, it's not a technical issue, but they failed because the business model that they
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.640]   had at the time didn't work for every single provider, and not every ISP is the same size.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:43.080]   Now, keep in mind too, people say, okay, Comcast doesn't want them to benefit in any way.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.520]   But if Comcast were to do that, Comcast would also lose subscribers.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.560]   That doesn't help Comcast business.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.000]   And then you have ISPs who don't keep--
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.800]   Well, that, by the way, that's the question.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.680]   Would Comcast lose subscribers?
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   Or would Netflix lose subscribers and then Comcast serve content from another content
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.920]   company that was more cooperative with Comcast business model?
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   That's the more I have.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.440]   Not if it's a subscriber's have somewhere else to go.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   Right.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.680]   It's a monopoly.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.400]   So who's going to lose business?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.680]   Comcast, they can't.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   It's a monopoly.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.040]   Netflix, they can because there's other competitors out there who may well have deals with Comcast.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.840]   That's the other issue with a merger, which you mentioned, is that Comcast is in a killer
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.240]   negotiation position with all content holders.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.200]   They're dominant.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:38.320]   So this agreement with Netflix and Comcast does include an SLA now, right?
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.840]   They have a service level agreement.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   Two SLAs.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.240]   So from the point of view of Netflix subscribers on Comcast, they're going to be happy.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   Yes, not overnight.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.680]   It's going to take a couple of weeks.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.000]   But yes, they're going to be happy.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.680]   And the price isn't going to go up because Netflix is actually saving money.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.000]   That's an interesting point.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.800]   And I understand this is tough.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.040]   Netflix is now 32% of all bandwidths during prime time in the US.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.360]   So you talk about big, you talk about dominant.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.280]   A third of all the bandwidth in prime time in the US is Netflix traffic.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.120]   So I understand why this is an issue for everybody.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.600]   Is it really cogent that is being in transogen here?
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.720]   cogent says we will not pay anyone anything.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.360]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.240]   That's not the way the business works.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.720]   So cogent wants to be a transit provider, like everybody else out there, but wants to
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.640]   be treated special.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.880]   They don't want to have to apply, play by any of the rules that every other transit provider
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.960]   has played by for 20 years.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.720]   And it's one of the reasons why the vast majority of the major CDNs out there absolutely refuse
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.160]   to buy transit from a cogent because they're so difficult to deal with.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.760]   Why does Netflix use them?
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   You'd have to ask Netflix.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.680]   Netflix doesn't just use cogent, though.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.520]   Keep in mind that they buy transit from multiple providers.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.840]   The two major ones that they buy for are cogent in level three.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   Right.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   I'm interested that European ISPs went for this deal, but American ISPs didn't.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.080]   But it's the crucial difference.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.520]   I don't know offhand.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.120]   I haven't spoken to a lot of the European ISPs, but one thing to think about is that the vast
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.600]   majority of Netflix traffic is still inside the US.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.000]   So there's more problems delivering video inside the last mile here, simply because of
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   the capacity.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.640]   Whereas in Europe, there's not as much traffic being delivered to those ISPs and they're
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.080]   not having as much of an issue with it.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.240]   The other story, I'll stay up in high altitude and low oxygen.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.800]   The other story I think not being discussed as part of this is a copyright story, is that
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.600]   the need to re-send the same movie over and over and over again, rather than being able
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   to use better technologies like peer-to-peer technologies, the amount of streaming that
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.040]   occurs through BitTorrent now, and yet it's not really available on the commercial side
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   of things.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:03.160]   And so that's an issue too, is that the legal situation is stopping us from finding efficient
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.920]   transit for content in ways that I think we could fix if we could sit down and figure
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920]   that out.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.560]   Well, PDP technologies doesn't work very well for something like Netflix because of the
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.240]   content protection.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   So PDPs--
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.640]   That's precisely what I'm saying.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.000]   If we could fix that and get around content protection but get in a way that still protects
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.280]   the holder, it's the same absurdity.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.000]   Netflix has this stream as a single copy of each movie for each subscriber.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Right.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.720]   And so what happened with, for example, on a different level, on the DVR level, the virtual
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:51.480]   DVR, it was cable vision that was the first cable company to experiment with the legal
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   shot across the bow to say that we're going to keep a single copy-- if you're all watching
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:04.560]   Big Bang Theory, rather than having to record the same exact show 100,000 times, we'll record
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560]   it once.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.560]   But you'll have the rights to record it and the rights to watch it.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.520]   So we have to get to a rights management structure.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.760]   What we're doing right now is an insane, insane and wasteful cluge around antiquated
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   copyright laws.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   And the biggest problem-- outside of copyright, I mean, the biggest problem we have in the
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.920]   industry is a whole, is there's no standards.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.840]   There's no standard video format, bitrate, codec, ex-special ratio, player, protocol,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   nothing.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.000]   And the only way you're going to have that is you need Apple, Microsoft, Sony, Google,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.720]   you need all these guys to work together.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.200]   And the problem that Netflix has is they have to take one piece of video and transcribe
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.720]   it 25 different times, times 50,000 videos, and then build a separate player or app for
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.240]   every single device in the market.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   That's crazy.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.720]   We're talking with Dan Rayburn.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.880]   He is executive vice president of streamingmedia.com and hit his post on the streaming media blog
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.520]   that caught my eye on Monday.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.760]   And I, you know, I'll fall on my own knife saying that the media got this story very
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   wrong.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.240]   And of course, you can see why it's a pretty technical story.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.760]   And Dan himself, even though this is his beat, said he had to ask some network providers
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.760]   for clarification.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   Absolutely.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.960]   I'm not sure what's happening in some cases, but your salient points are that this, these
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.200]   commercial interconnects are how the internet works.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.640]   It doesn't have to do with net neutrality.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.520]   Do you not feel that Comcast in any way has put the squeeze on cogent and or Netflix?
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:40.840]   No, because what people don't understand is cogent is selling a service to Netflix and
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.520]   they're guaranteeing a level of quality.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.280]   And then they're going to Comcast and saying, even though I've sold a service, I can't deliver
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   it.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.360]   You need to give me more access to your network than I'm allowed to have via your appearing
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   policy.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.800]   Oh, and by the way, give it to me for free.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   Right.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.960]   And by the way, this is, yeah, it does.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.000]   And by the way, this is something Verizon is now is dealing with as well.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.440]   And you can expect a similar, I imagine a similar result.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.640]   Verizon and AT&T have already publicly stated that they will do similar deals with Netflix
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   shortly.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.040]   He's Netflix happy with his deal.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   Absolutely.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.440]   And it all goes down, the quality goes up.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.480]   So I mean, if it were a net neutrality issue, the first thing you'd expect is that Netflix
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.600]   would be upset.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.960]   The second thing you'd expect is Netflix competitors to say, well, you see, we're disadvantaged.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.360]   Netflix could be happy to do this deal.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   What about you?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   Right.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.920]   What happens if you're expected to do things that you can't do?
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.920]   Well, you're not.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.400]   Netflix is okay with it.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.360]   It doesn't mean it's not a pro, a competitive problem.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.520]   Right, they just paid the guy who controls the pipe for access to your house.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.320]   If I couldn't get these Netflix for my cable at some point, I'm going to, there's going
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.040]   to be riots in the street.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.360]   So Netflix knows that.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   Here's the problem though.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.680]   It's not competitive because you don't go out and build your own CDN unless you're the
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.320]   size of scale of Apple, Microsoft, Netflix.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.760]   There's less than 10 guys who built their own CDN out there.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.800]   So if you want good quality video and you're smaller and you can't cut a deal with Comcast
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.680]   like Netflix can, you use a third party CDN.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.320]   Like Acromide, Limelater, Level 3, or Edgecast, and you get the same level of quality at
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.640]   a cheaper price because you're a smaller provider.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.920]   So it's definitely not a competitive issue.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   So just bottom line, you say I should watch Netflix on Apple TV.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   Well, right now, you know, now it's going to get improved in the next few weeks.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.760]   Chromecast, is that a good choice?
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.200]   Well, Chromecast isn't really a streaming box per se.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   Chromecast is really different than say a Roku or Apple TV.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   How are you?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Right.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   How's Roku?
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   Is it good?
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   Roku is the best box in the market in terms of content choices available.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.120]   If you go to streamingmediadevices.com, you can see a breakout chart of all the devices
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   in the market and all the content choices they have.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.240]   Is the throughput good though?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.760]   Well, that's not on the Apple TV.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.960]   So, but I don't think you have to worry about that because now that the deal's signed and
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.440]   it's already underway, it's going to be good on everything.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.960]   Within a couple more weeks, all this will be gone.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.560]   And then, and then poor Voodoo will have to suffer.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.080]   Walmart, yeah, I don't know that anybody really cares about Walmart.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:20.280]   I mean, to me, that's kind of the issue is that the other streaming companies competing
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.080]   with Netflix now need to make the same deal, don't they?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.680]   Well, they don't because keep in mind Hulu doesn't run a CDN.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.160]   Hulu uses Akamai, Lymly, Level-
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.960]   And they've made those deals.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   Right.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.160]   And the CDNs already have transit in place through providers to get into the ISP.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.520]   And that's why it doesn't affect me, Jeff, because I don't have my own CDN.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.880]   I am on you streaming Justin in BitGravity.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.840]   And those providers have deals with, I presume, Level-3 and others.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   Yes.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   Okay.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.160]   Well, I think, Dan, you have made everything clear as mud, but it's not your fault because
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.000]   it is really complicated stuff.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.120]   Although, you've done the best job explaining it, I've heard yet.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.760]   And I think you've made a strong case why this is a separate issue from net neutrality.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.240]   I'm not going to go so far as to say it doesn't impact net neutrality, but it is a separate
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240]   issue.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   Yeah, it gets proper way to say it.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   Right.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.480]   But I think you could see, given what Dan described, you could see the sort of pinch points if
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   Comcast starts tightening the screws on those CDNs and on those providers who are pushing
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   stuff like from Netflix.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   If that starts to become an issue, that's where Comcast controls over that last round.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.720]   Remember, they can't put the screws on them though because Netflix has a guaranteed SLA
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.240]   with Comcast that's covered for multiple years.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.120]   Yeah, that's the key that they got in this.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.880]   They got a service level agreement that guarantees them a certain performance.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   Right.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.160]   And I'm not thinking about Netflix specifically.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.640]   I'm thinking about other content providers.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.760]   I mean, companies like Netflix are always going to be able to cut deals.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.080]   I'm concerned about companies that we've never even heard of or content providers that come
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   up that are new.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.360]   If that starts to be a bottleneck where Comcast controls the access to the last mile, that's
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   a potential problem.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.520]   Well, no, because they don't have the traffic that an Netflix has.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.320]   So there's no bottleneck there because there's no throughput issue.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.240]   So if you're an up and coming video company, your traffic is so small that you wouldn't
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.640]   want to cut a deal with Comcast because you're not running your own servers.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   You're not a CDN.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.480]   By the way, apparently Comcast is going to go to cogent and ask them for money too still,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   right?
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.720]   This doesn't eliminate that problem.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.760]   Well, sure it does.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:38.680]   Cogent's not going to be the middleman between Comcast and Netflix anymore.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.600]   So the money that Netflix was paying cogent, cogent's not going to get that money over
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   time.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   Cogent has come out and said that about 2% around 2% of its total revenue comes from
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   Netflix.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.240]   But the interesting stat is somewhere between 70 and 80% of all the traffic on Cogent's
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.080]   network is from Netflix.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.320]   So what does that tell you about the business model that Cogent is in or any transit provider?
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.400]   It's not a great business.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.240]   Dave Schafer, who's the CEO of Cogent, told us, told RSTECNICA.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.560]   And maybe this is his spin on it.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   The Comcast wants everybody who they can possibly extract a payment from to pay them, even though
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.480]   the traffic that's reaching their customers has been paid for by their customers.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.600]   Well, it hasn't been paid for by their customers.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.440]   It's been paid for by Netflix, the cogent, not by the customer.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   Right.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.840]   So he's kind of, it sounds like, intentionally misrepresenting the situation.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   Yes.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.400]   Ben's been doing that if you look just Wikipedia cogent.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.800]   One of the first things that comes up is here's a history of other major pairing disputes
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.040]   with AOL, Telaglobe, France, telecom.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.960]   Melissa goes on and on.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.480]   It's really interesting.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   Wow.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   Hey, thank you, Dan.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.800]   I really appreciate you're taking the time.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:55.280]   And if people want to read more Dan Rayburn's column is at streamingmediablog.com and lots
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.320]   of good information there.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.040]   For instance, prices on transit.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   Right.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:06.160]   Which apparently is as low as a buck-a-megabit, a lot less than it is in other countries,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   Japan $25.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   It's even lower than that.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   So, transit.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.280]   And maybe that's something to also just quickly cover is there's been reports out in the media
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.680]   that Comcast wanted $400 million from Netflix for this deal, which is absurd.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.360]   And then there were some that were saying, well, the deal size, the Comcast is $25 to $50
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.440]   million per year.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.960]   That's not accurate either.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.040]   Last year, Comcast went on a record to say that the amount of revenue they got company
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.720]   wide for all these beneficial interconnection agreements that are paid was between $30 and
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.960]   $60 million between all content orders.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   So total.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   Total.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   That's public record.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.360]   So Netflix is not paying $50 million to Comcast for this.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   Right.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.560]   But they might be paying a significant fraction thereof.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.840]   Well, they're paying.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   You could run the numbers.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.960]   Look at how much capacity they need and look at transit pricing.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   And it's not transit pricing you could use as an estimate because keep in mind Comcast
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   is giving Netflix wholesale pricing.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Right.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.280]   But it's not the numbers people are putting out.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.120]   I just looked up Susan Crawford's Twitter feed because Susan, I think, is brilliant on
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.120]   these issues.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:19.040]   And she wrote a book called, was a captive audience, I think, about the Comcast.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.760]   And she's one little fact here, which is, it was an idea of the changing business.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:29.480]   Comcast numbers for the periods of 01 to 05 versus 09 to 13 revenue up 112%, but CapEx
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   up 14%.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.560]   And her point is that Comcast is now in a position where they're not investing more
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.280]   in growth of capital.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.800]   They're harvesting the incredible market position they have.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:47.960]   And so we hear sometimes that cable is a bad, is great for cash flow, bad for profit.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:55.480]   But the gross revenue, the gross profit on internet access and such and so on, is very,
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.640]   very high.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.400]   And when you own the monopoly, this is where the business starts to go.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.800]   So the dynamics of the business start to change for Comcast.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.520]   And that's what's worth watching here is that this is just one small, very small part
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.800]   of Comcast business, but Comcast is worth watching.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:15.320]   Susan Crawford's Twitter feed is S Crawford if you want to follow along.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.800]   And as you mentioned, her book is called Captive Audience.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   Thank you, Dan.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Really appreciate your time.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   Thanks, Dan.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.240]   Really interesting stuff.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.880]   We'll have you back soon.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   Thank you.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.600]   Yeah, it's nice to have an expert on this.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.680]   And we've been trying really hard to get people like Milo Medin, who runs Google's
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.080]   Gigabit Project and was formerly Comcast at home.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.720]   Formerly at home, yeah.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   On.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   They're not going to come and talk about it.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   No, they don't want to talk about it.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.040]   I'm not going to have it.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.280]   I think we have a shot at Dane Jasper at Sonic, Ned.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.640]   He's been very outspoken on all of this, too.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.920]   We will continue to cover the story.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.240]   He actually responded to Dane Jasper and his thoughts are in the note.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   Ah, good.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.360]   So he couldn't be here, but he didn't send us a...
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.840]   Yeah, he did send a little blur.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   Little blur.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.360]   All right, well, we'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   Thanks, Dan.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   Thanks, guys.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   Take care.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   We will continue with this week in Google.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.040]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.680]   This is a, I think, a great subject, but Google's been kind of busy, too.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.440]   So we'll talk about that, too.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.240]   In just a bit, Matthew Ingram is here from Gigalome.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.360]   Great to have you, as always, Matthew.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.080]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis from New York, New York.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.880]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.640]   A great place to go if you want to build your wealth.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.040]   Who doesn't, right?
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.720]   You got a plan for the future, plan for your retirement, at the very least.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.680]   Personal Capital puts all your accounts in one place so you can see how you're doing
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.240]   with all of your financial information, your stocks, your 401(k), your bank accounts, your
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.880]   charge cards, your mortgages, your loans.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.480]   Very hard to follow all that since it's always on many different sites with different usernames
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.000]   and passwords.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.960]   And if you're paying somebody to manage your money, this is great, too, because you can
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.880]   not only see if you're overpaying, but you can get financial advice.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.600]   Personal Capital offers free software to let you know where your money is, see all your
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.880]   accounts in one place in real time, make better wealth management decisions and get
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.960]   objective financial advice from some of the best people in the business.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.800]   Your financial dashboard tells you everything about how you're doing and where you're overpaying,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.440]   for instance, on fees.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.160]   The mobile apps are great.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.960]   And then, of course, the financial advisor.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.040]   The best financial advisory services, too.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.800]   All of this for free is at personalcapital.com/twig to sign up for your free account.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.120]   I've been using it for well more than a year.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.840]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:54.560]   Finally, your whole financial life in one single place, and we thank them for their support
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.280]   of this week in Google.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.360]   So it's in the notes.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   Where's the notes?
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   I don't do we have notes.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.960]   If you hover over that cell that says it has the note in it, that's a note.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.120]   So Dane Jasper, who some of you...
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.280]   We're learning how to use Google Docs today.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.200]   This fancy technology is going to be good tips.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.320]   I always wonder what that is.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.720]   Look at that.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   You hover over it.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   Oh, whoa.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   Let's call it.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Dane is a friend of the network.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.640]   He's been on many times before he's regular on this weekend enterprise tech and he's the
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   CEO and founder of SonicNet, which is an independent internet service provider that is one of
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.360]   the best in the country, consistently ranks top in protecting its users.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.440]   I just think they're a great company and it's local.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.680]   It's just up the road a piece.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.560]   So he's been a really good advisor for us all and he has a car with a license plate,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.760]   Linux.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.760]   So that's a good thing.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   Right.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.720]   Because you asked him about all of this.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.560]   We wanted to get an interview and he said he couldn't be available, but he sent over.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.240]   He says it's an interesting development.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.800]   One thought worth discussing maybe whether an evolution of the internet into a two-sided
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:08.840]   model where both subscribers and content providers ends up, which is what we're moving
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   in some ways moving towards.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   You pay for internet access and then the people who get to you pay for their access.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.960]   And it doesn't have to be that the burden is on me because it goes upstream to your
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.760]   transit providers and your CDNs.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.840]   But he says the question is, does this may benefit large incumbents?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.320]   If a competitive entrant can't get content to pay them something, while the incumbent
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.520]   is collecting money which subsidizes internet access, what happens?
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   This is the key issue.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.600]   I got into two discussions with Andreessen on Twitter.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.960]   And Steve Mark has been going crazy on this.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   Amazing.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.800]   He doesn't want any government regulation.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   Right.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   No, I'm not sure it's true.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.240]   Well, Matthew wrote about this and he'll give us a minute a second.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:02.400]   But I think that the issue remains that we don't have a competitive marketplace.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.320]   And we all want competitive marketplace except those who are incumbents in the non-competitive
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   marketplace.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.240]   And there's disagreement about how to get there.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.560]   And do we need some steps along the way like regulation to protect the consumers who are
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.520]   stuck in a monopoly?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.280]   But even those of us who, and I think Susan Crawford will be included in this, who at
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:29.760]   some level believe that there's some need for some regulation along the way, the ultimate
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   solution is competition.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   No question about that.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760]   Right.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.920]   Well, and you can see why this would worry Dane because he's a small guy relative to
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   these guys.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   Exactly.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.600]   He's becoming bigger and he worries that he just cannot compete or new people in the,
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.560]   you never see a new internet service provider because the incumbents have all the deal in
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   the soda.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.440]   You have states passing laws preventing cities where you can't create their own competition.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.920]   That's something the FCC should be.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.040]   Like that should not be allowed.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.440]   If it's not easy for a region or a city or whatever to fund or to help develop their
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.400]   own competitive internet service, that's a serious problem.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.920]   Then you're basically just relying on Google fiber to solve all your problems.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.120]   So let's talk, okay.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.880]   So Mark Andreessen, it's weird to have a debate in 140 character chunks.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.600]   Probably not the best format.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.200]   He's an expert at it though.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.160]   He managed to get a lot in there.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.880]   His Twitter handle is PMARCAP.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.920]   Marka, you should follow.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.400]   So he did it and then today Kenny Lehrer who's an investor at Kevin's Stuff, did his own
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.760]   little list and now there's mockeries of their lists going on.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.280]   But you know what he didn't do?
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.560]   What Mark does really well is respond.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.280]   If you notice, you go back through the thread.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.400]   It's not just him posting thought after thought after thought.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.720]   People challenge him and then he responds.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.640]   That's the crucial difference and that's where it becomes much more of a debate or discussion
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.040]   than just...
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.680]   So it started with a remark from a Matt Iglesias who was a former slate writer and now writes
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.120]   for the new first look media peer, Omidyar's project.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.680]   The internet was nice while it lasted and he links to an article on the Verge.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.240]   Actually, I don't know if this is...
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.200]   We're trying to get Neilai Patel as well on this because...
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.920]   He links to Netflix's paying off Comcast for direct traffic access.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.120]   And I love Neilai Patel's article from last year.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.200]   I can't say it out.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.680]   The name of it out loud.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.640]   The internet is effed in which he goes into greater detail about everything screwing up
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   so Iglesias says the internet was nice while it lasted.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   And then Mark Andreessen responds, "Suppose...
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   Well, Matthew, you wrote this great article so I'll let you do it because I'm referring...
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   Why should I read you your article?"
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   You wrote it.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.640]   So all I did was try and take some of the tweets and put them into context because it is hard to follow.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   If you see one or you see them out of order and then you have to go back...
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   Basically wrote the Bloomsday book for Mark Andreessen's tweets.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   So I turned it into a blog because he obviously didn't want to or didn't have...
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   He finally did.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   He finally did.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   He did one on media.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   As usual, Matthew, you beat him to do it.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   So his point was...
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   And I talked with him a bit about this after I wrote it and then I tried to include some of his responses
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   and just a sort of never-ending process.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   But his main point was not so much that he doesn't want or think there should be some regulation.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   What he's afraid of is that if it's just your common carriers and so you have to do whatever we tell you,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   that Comcast and other providers aren't going to invest, and not just Comcast and other providers,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   but new companies aren't going to invest the money that's required to create competition.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   Wait a minute, wait a second, Matthew. That's why Susan Crawford's little data point there is really interesting.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   -Right. -The A.S.T.E.N.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   -Right. -Go ahead.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   And so his...
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   And he admitted that he doesn't actually know how to produce the competition that he wants to see.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   It's just his fear is that if there's too much regulation, it's going to disincentivize anyone from providing the bandwidth that we need.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   And his sort of vision of the future is we have a thousand times the bandwidth we have now.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   We're all doing virtual reality 3D teleconferencing and whatnot.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   That's kind of the future he wants to get to.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   So it's not so much about who's providing our Netflix shows right now.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   It's about who's going to provide the massive quantities of bandwidth that we need in the future.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.640]   -And he's tried to say something. I didn't understand his point. Maybe you did, Matthew,
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   where he would say, "Well, okay, it's one matter if you're talking about this today, but if we have a hundred times the bits traversing,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   then that becomes very different in kind of who pays."
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   And isn't that the classic argument that no one's going to build this unless they get paid twice?
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   But the truth is the internet has gotten faster and faster and rates have gone down and down.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   -And we're... -And so then we're in the end of one.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   -And we're in the worst law here. -Yep.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   Yeah, and that's one good response is that people have invested and they have...
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   But we also have monopolies on those last miles.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   And now they're like you suggested with Comcast, they're basically harvesting the fruits of that monopoly.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   So the question is how to get...
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   So his analogy was the trucking industry highways and so on.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   Let's say Netflix is a company that's basically taking up 80% of the highways.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   Should they at some point have to pay more because they're using up so much of that sort of...
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   -Well, that's actually... -I think that works against him, doesn't it?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   Because the highways are...
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   And we're one, they're built by government and couldn't have been built by private industry.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   They were built by government controlling and contracting the private industry to do it.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   But government was claiming to control A.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   B, if Netflix was filling 8% of the highways, they would only be doing that if there was a consumer demand for what they were carrying.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   And so the consumers would say, "Yeah, let's have more highways."
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   Because there's a demand for it.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   If you can't get your whatever the goodies Netflix is carrying to you, that's an issue.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   They're not just gonna fill the highways, the second fill in the highways.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   No, and so Dan Gilmore pointed out you're the highway issue that you just mentioned,
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   which is that if we had relied on private industry, you probably wouldn't have as many highways
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640]   and they'd all be toll roads.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   So ultimately, he didn't get at the central issue, which is how do you take what we have now
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   and turn it into something more competitive?
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   And so that then new providers can be...
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   And one of the things that a couple of people suggested, including me, was making it easier for local
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   towns, municipalities, regions, whatever, to bring in competitive providers, to do high-frequency
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   microwave, to do whatever, to pull in fiber, or bring in Google, to something that can blunt the force of those monopolies.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   There actually has been a movement.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   In fact, we've talked to a good friend of mine, Tim Posar, who is an activist in the Bay Area for community Internet.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   And remember, we talked to...
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   Who was it we talked to that was a big community Internet supporter?
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   That was OAM.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   OAM has community Internet in his apartment.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   It's a commercial thing, but it was the guy who...
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   One of the guys who wrote VisiCalc.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   Oh, Brooklyn?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   It wasn't Brooklyn.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   That was the other one.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   I can't remember his name.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   But this is his big thing now, is it's completely doable technologically for a community group's towns to...
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   Bob Frankston.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   Bob Frankston is big in this community Internet by wholesale Internet and wire their towns and eliminate this.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   And that's the way to get competition.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:10.640]   The cable companies really only have a monopoly thanks to the willingness of local communities to give them a franchise.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   Exactly.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   The local communities don't have to participate.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   And Driessen also mentioned freeing up unlicensed spectrum, which is something that hasn't been happening as quickly as I think most people would argue it should.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   There's theoretically unlicensed spectrum out there that new providers could use to provide all kinds of competitive services.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   Which I absolutely agree with, and which is critical.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   But I'll go back to Susan Crawford once again, because she's brilliant and I'm never wrong holding her, is that...
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   Yes, we want that and yes, we need that, but she says that does not substitute for fiber.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   That what we're going to carry that a hundred times more bits that Driessen predicts, it ain't going to happen over mobile.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   A lot of the fiber that is out there was built much like the Internet's state highway system by the US government.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   Or funded by the US government.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   It's not all commercial by any means.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   Well, and you have to admit that a lot of the fiber that we're using that's super cheap was created by companies that went bust in the last bubble.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   In 1999, yeah.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   And thank God they did, because they blew their brains out on all this fiber that we're now using super cheap.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   Do we need another bubble?
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   What about Mark?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   And by the way, for the young people, we need another bubble.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   Bubbles always build infrastructure.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.640]   It happened with the railroads, it happened with the Internet.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   Electricity?
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.640]   So bubbles are good in that respect, they're not wasted.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   Bring back the bubble.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   For those of you who are too young to know who the hell Mark and Driessen is...
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   Oh, that hurts me, you say that.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   Oh, man.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   Oh, man.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   He was a graduate student at the University of Illinois at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in CSA in Urbana.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:56.640]   And wrote one of the very earliest Internet browsers, Mosaic, or co-wrote it.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   And then, of course, Mosaic was brought commercial as Netscape made a lot of money when Netscape was one of the first big,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   bubble IPOs.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   And 95 was the one that started the bubble, actually.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   I started writing about technology stocks when Netscape went public and I created NetDax as we called it,
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   of early Internet companies, none of which exist now.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   That's awesome.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   And, of course, now he is a venture capitalist and runs Andreas in Horowitz.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   But he's respected by everybody, not merely as a venture capitalist, but as a pioneer and a smart fellow.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   He does have one idea. He tweets, "To you, Jeff Jarvis, one more practical idea, no discrimination on type or content of bits, just volume."
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   And isn't that what we're talking about here?
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   Isn't that kind of bits, but the volume?
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   Eisenberg came back and said, "No, that doesn't work because video is volume."
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   And so you can discriminate against video by just...
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   By straight shirt.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   Yes, exactly.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   True.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   All your little slow bits, show you little bits, no problem, but those big bits.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   Right.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   Gotcha.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   That's our video.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   That's for us.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   Text people.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   Right.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   Gigomes.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   Ask him.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   Ask him.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   Ask him.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   I did like Stacey Higginbottom's suggestion that one thing we could do is get the FCC could do is to say to Comcast and others,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   you've got to reveal the details of the deals you're making.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   Right.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   Transparency would help a lot here.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.640]   Sure would, because what do we know about those deals?
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   We know the tiny little details, the guys like Dan or whatever can uncover.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   What if there was a public auction market?
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   What if all that information was publicly available?
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   You could see who was bidding for space and who was selling.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   I mean, that in itself would make it more comprehensible.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   Are we...
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   All these all pipe dreams though, really.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.640]   I mean, there's so much money now going on.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   The FCC cannot be trusted to regulate this.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   The government can certainly not be trusted to regulate this.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   Any thought of making this more rational or better, is there any hope at all of doing that?
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   Very scared for the interview.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   I hope so.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   I really hope so.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   Maybe I'm just old and cynical and jaded.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   I just feel like...
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   Well, I think we have to sort of pick certain things like you can show at the FCC and say,
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   "You need to beat up on Comcast, but realistically that's probably not going to happen."
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   But I think it's much more realistic to say, "Open up some more spectrum."
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   That's an easy thing to do.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   Make it easier for municipalities and regions to start or help fund competitive providers.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   That's a relatively easy thing to do.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   You know, that's a low-hanging fruit.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   Neil I Patel says the solution is to treat the Internet as a utility.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Like water and electricity.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   That's kind of what Bob Frankston was saying.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   Just as municipalities run water and electricity in most towns, they could run the Internet.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   Well, there's...
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.140]   I wish Kevin Mark should be on here because he got into the argument with Andreessen and
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:02.520]   pushed the British model, which is that BT is the mild of the home and then there's open
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   access across that.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.760]   Which seems to work pretty well and is not discriminatory.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.640]   But the issue then is BT going to invest sufficiently.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   Will a Google fiber come in then?
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.720]   When Andreessen actually, at the last sort of at the end of the discussion, he seemed to
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.960]   agree that that was not a bad model.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.480]   That if you had a kind of utility provider that was either wholly subsidized or partially
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.760]   subsidized, then you could have competing providers on top of that.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.800]   But the sort of bedrock, you know, the pipe would be something that was either public
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   or publicly funded.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.640]   Well, that's where we've gone to with electricity in the U.S. in a lot of states.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   Right.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.600]   Well, the wire into my house is, you know, whoever paid for it going in, I don't know.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.120]   But now I can buy electricity from various players.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.560]   I can choose to buy green electricity.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.560]   Right.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.560]   But it's all...
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560]   And hydro...
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   Yep.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   Hydro is, of course, by saluting...
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   Oh, Canada.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   Hydro electricity.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   Of course I could do that too.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.320]   Lots of water in Canada.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   We have tons of water.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.560]   If you want any, we'd happy to...
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   Oh, he does.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   He wants it.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   He needs it.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.960]   You know, you know, what else you got in Canada?
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   Tim Bray.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   True.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.600]   Google will not let him work from Vancouver, so he quits.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.000]   Yeah, I found that really surprising, you know.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.600]   I would have expected that from Yahoo.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.880]   But I guess it surprised me that Google wasn't willing to sort of accommodate that.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.400]   Who is Tim Bray?
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.040]   Jeez, who's Tim Bray?
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.680]   He's a legend.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   Tim Bray?
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   He's a legend.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.080]   Is that Tim Bray?
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.120]   The Tim Bray.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:50.080]   He's quitting as of March 17th because he wouldn't move to California.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.800]   He's a software developer, co-founded OpenText Corporation.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   He was one of the...
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Oh, wrote the XML spec.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.240]   XML, the author of the XML spec.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.920]   Yeah, he's kind of one of those guys.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.240]   And his blog is down, man.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.520]   Too many people are trying to read this story at tbray.org.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.720]   I'm trying to pull it up and I can't get it anyway.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.080]   Yeah, that's kind of a shame.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.160]   But I also can understand, having been in the same position myself, how hard it is sometimes
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.960]   to have off-site employees.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.840]   It just depends what you need that employee to do.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.520]   He did say he understood.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.680]   He said that he didn't blame them for making that decision.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.240]   But it's interesting that he is sort of love of Vancouver and his dislike of San Francisco
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   just made it.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:46.880]   He just couldn't bring himself to do it.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   Google's smartwatch.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.240]   We thought we might see some announcements at Mobile World Congress.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.760]   We did see new smartwatches from Samsung.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:59.280]   The gear, the new gear, the Neo, the new gear and the gear fit.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.240]   Actually that gear fit looked pretty sweet.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   It kind of a curved band and so forth.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.360]   Super AMOLED scrolling touch display.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:13.120]   No word of a Google watch, although the rumor is Wall Street Journal and others have said
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:21.800]   that LG will be making a Google now kind of a watch for Google.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.560]   Apple of course working on a watch too.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.560]   Nothing to say.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.560]   Wearables.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.560]   Oh, wearables.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.480]   I feel like any minute now, it's just going to all take off.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.840]   Are you going to get one, Leo?
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:41.720]   I have a pebble and was underwhelmed by its utility and its attractiveness so I don't
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.600]   wear it.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   But on the other hand, if somebody made a nice looking watch that did some of the things
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.880]   that the pebble did or the or I thought the gear fit looks pretty good, what are you wearing,
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.880]   Jeff?
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   Is that Google glass?
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.040]   Well, yeah, this I got.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.520]   So these are the lenses.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.180]   I'm just realizing the first time I put them on during the show and the because it's curved
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.680]   just evidently that affects my prescriptions.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.600]   And so when I watch you, you're all fuzzy now and you have to look up like that.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.100]   Yeah, which is does not work either.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.700]   But they look good.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.380]   I got to say that that looks pretty good.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.000]   You don't look quite so dorky.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.100]   Well, Dororo meter goes higher when you go over.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.100]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.060]   Yeah, the big band on the on the right.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:31.480]   The funny thing was that I wore it in class this week and the students, you know, I thought
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   I got it.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   I thought it was said all I said all of you're acting like I have kudos.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.880]   They said, yeah, you do.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.280]   Yeah, I knew that would happen.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.720]   Everybody said, you know, whenever people whenever I asked people for a year now, when
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.800]   I've said to people, oh, glasses, they said, Oh, no, you walked down the street, everybody
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.480]   wants to see it and touch it.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.280]   Yeah, that wore off.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.680]   Now they just did any of your students take a swing at you like that lady at the bar?
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.680]   I know.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.920]   No, we have a story of San Francisco of a lady in a bar.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   But that really happened.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.840]   It doesn't feel like it really happened.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.280]   I think it's oversimplified a bit in the news reports, but I think it's just simply
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   that she had a lot.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.600]   She was showing it to a friend.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.560]   Somebody came over and you can imagine what this is and says, is that taking pictures
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.560]   of me?
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.640]   You know, why would I?
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.360]   And then they got into us and she said, you know, I'm creating a video on now and I'm
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.080]   telling you it's on, you know, so you can tell it's on.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.000]   And then the woman got all pissed off with a hand up at it and then there was some kind
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.640]   of fight around it.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:30.360]   Sarah Slocum wrote in her on her Facebook, M G. So you'll never believe this, but I got
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.880]   verbally and physically assaulted and robbed last night in the city had things thrown at
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:41.400]   me because of some wanker Google Glass haters and then some bleep tore them off my face
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   and ran out with them then.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:49.280]   And when I ran out after him, his bleep friends stole my purse, cell phone, wallet and everything.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   Wow.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:58.680]   I mean, this is a discussion we had last week in a sense is that this is a, I think it's
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.840]   part of this larger San Francisco Google.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.240]   Maybe a witness told the local news channel here, the crowd was yelling, you're being
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.400]   an asshole.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   Take those glasses off.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.360]   She did manage to videotape it with her glass and she says she's turned the footage over
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   to the police.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.920]   It's something.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.120]   They're going to be going through the streets of San Francisco banging on and destroying
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.480]   all the looms.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   Is this the video?
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:31.040]   Well, how does she, she must have gotten the glasses back?
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.240]   No, no, I really think the glass was stolen.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.760]   They gave her the else was stolen.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.640]   She think I think they took the glasses.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.560]   They're the glass, but she got it back.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.560]   Oh, is that it?
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   Okay.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:48.120]   My sense is if you're going to be, if you're going, and I'm not saying anything about her
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:54.480]   behavior, but if you're going to wear glass and be kind of really obvious about it, late
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:00.360]   at night in a dive bar when people have had a lot to drink, it's probably poor judgment.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.640]   I'm just going to say, not blaming the victim here.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.000]   It's a punk bar.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Right.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.920]   Molotov's is a punk bar.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.560]   So I think you're kind of mean, I don't know.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.880]   Do you know Molotov's Sarah?
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   She goes there all the time.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   Is it a punk bar?
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   It's not.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.480]   Matt Honan says it's not.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.240]   Matt Honan says it's not a punk bar.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.440]   Sarah says Sarah knows every bar in the city.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   What is it?
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.520]   I mean, it's a non techie bar.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.520]   No, I'm techie.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   There you go.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   Where is it?
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   Lower hate.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.520]   Oh, it's a punk bar.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.320]   If it's in the lower hate, it's a dive.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.520]   Don't go in the lower hate and wear glass.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.520]   Look at that.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.520]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   Come on.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   You're telling me.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.520]   So that's all I'm saying.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   A little judgment maybe.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   This is a requirement.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.960]   I mean, we're not if you look, if you were on Union Street and got beat up, then I'd
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.520]   say it was something there.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.120]   I'm just being so.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.520]   Sarah's shaking her head.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.400]   It is interesting though.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.080]   I don't think this is going to be the last by any means.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:11.160]   This is going to happen more and more often the way I think it was anti Google, right?
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:16.000]   Because there's more footage in which a woman said, well, here, I think this is some more
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   video.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.600]   See, she keeps taping people as they're talking to her.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   Can you get my audio?
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   It's a long, long.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   This is channel four.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.880]   You may want to get accustomed to seeing people wearing that Google glass item as a
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.880]   tech report.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   Wow.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   Here is here to tell us tonight.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.440]   Everybody is comfortable when somebody's wearing Google glass and they're present.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   Gabe, why is that?
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   Well, Gabe, why is that?
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.200]   I'm saying I can't believe this over and over again the whole night.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.760]   I just was the only thing that could come out of my mouth.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.480]   It was the weirdest event.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.240]   Sarah was out with her friends when they entered a bar in the hate ashberry area in
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   San Francisco.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.360]   It's kind of an art bar.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.080]   She captured through her Google glass.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.880]   And we were there maybe about 15 minutes.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.240]   And two girls that were there, they started showing a lot of animosity towards me because
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.960]   I was wearing Google glass.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.280]   And at that point, I turned on the video.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   Oh, here it comes.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   So I started recording.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   So they're drunk.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.120]   I walked up to the bar just saying like, "Oh, Google glass."
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.840]   Like, you know, it's negative kind of comment.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.840]   Okay, Sarah, this is when you leave.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.840]   You don't stay there and record it.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.320]   I wasn't even, you know, wasn't on.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.720]   I wasn't using it.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   You know, I mean, they clearly didn't understand.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   Wait a second.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.160]   She has a right to be there and not to be her ass.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   I guess right.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   Grew and got more votes.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.160]   But if she says you're killing the city, but she says it with a smile.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.480]   Yeah, but you see, that's the anti Google.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.480]   Right.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:49.840]   According to the LA Times, the altercation accelerated or after a friend who was with
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.520]   her took a swing at and or punched someone who was.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.400]   I feel like there's, I do feel like there's more to this story.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.400]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   And it's a little ginned up.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   It's a little too much.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.960]   Let me tell you.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.720]   I don't know.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   Come on, glassholes.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.720]   Knock it off.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.000]   It's your fault.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.280]   I do have to say I feel a little bit like it's.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.280]   Are you kicking me off the show, Leo?
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   No.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.560]   No, this is here is a good, this is a good venue to, you should wear your Google glass
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.560]   here.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   You're amongst friends.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.400]   They're not going to be like this, the whole show.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.480]   These are progressive lenses and mid ranges there.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.560]   Sounds like you got bad.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.040]   The lenses are wrong.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.760]   It's no, the glasses, these are curved.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.840]   So it all is a different for me.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   In fact, when I look at my tablet, it looks like a shape like this.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   It's a problem.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.120]   It's another problem.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:55.280]   Going to quartz Google does not want to hire top college graduates.
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.360]   Actually, it was an interview with the New York Times, Tom Friedman, Google's head of
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.040]   people operations, Laszlo Bach.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.400]   And though I'm Laszlo Bach, I'm head of people operations.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:13.400]   As opposed to the other man, like colleagues with the head of robot.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:20.000]   He says Google has determined that your GPA is worthless as a criterion for hiring and
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.320]   test scores are worthless.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.280]   They don't predict anything.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.600]   The proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased, not decreased
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   in time.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.400]   Chad and I are going, yeah.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.800]   Now as high as 14%.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.600]   He says, good grades don't hurt because many jobs at Google require math, computing, and
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.720]   coding skills.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.960]   But he says people who come out of top colleges are kind of arrogant.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   No kidding.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.960]   They lax.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.680]   But the funny thing was Google had first insisted you only came from one of the top colleges
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.600]   that only that you had perfect grades and only that you had the highest test scores.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.040]   So this is just so opposite of where they were.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.280]   But this notion of intellectual humility, I quite like in this.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.440]   I do like that.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.720]   If you're intellectually heuristic, then you think that the grades are so smart.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.200]   I think you know everything because they mentioned specifically that learning ability is one of
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   the things they look for.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.560]   It says for every job, this is the quote.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.600]   The number one thing we look for is general cognitive ability.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   That's not IQ.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   It's learning ability.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.720]   The ability to process on the fly, the ability to pull together disparate bits of information.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.880]   We assessed that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they're
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   predictive.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.320]   That's what I get south for go south.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   Press this button.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.720]   The second attribute after learning ability leadership in particular, emergent leadership
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.480]   as opposed to traditional leadership, traditional leadership is where you president of the
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.440]   chess club, we don't care.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.520]   What we care about is when faced with a problem and you're a member of a team, do you at the
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.640]   appropriate time step in and lead and just as critically do you step back and stop leading
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.240]   and let someone else.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.160]   So your skull and bones membership is not going to cut it.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.440]   You know, I don't care.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.120]   They don't want me.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.640]   I don't want them.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.800]   So now we're going to see people trying to hide the fact that they went to.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   I am.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   Community college.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.440]   I am telling you, I'm the best of all worlds.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.840]   I went to Yale and I dropped out.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.040]   So there, I knew when to step back.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.600]   Got in and then you said, ah, is that all there is?
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.840]   I was president of the chess club and then I quit.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840]   So there.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:50.400]   The interesting thing though, is the Google, they do do, you know, we can make fun of them
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.920]   for it, but they do do a huge amount of sort of data analysis, even on stuff like this.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.480]   Like what people eat in the cafeteria, when they come in and when they leave, when they
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.160]   park in lots empty and when it doesn't.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.120]   So I'm sure they've looked exhaustively at the performance of new hires and figured this
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.440]   out, it's refreshing in a way.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.960]   He also says that people who are the most successful successful here have a fierce position.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.520]   They'll argue like L. There'd be zealots about their point of view, but then you say,
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.360]   here's a new fact and they'll go, oh, well, that changes things.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.920]   You're right.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.760]   He says you need a big ego and a small ego in the same person at the same time.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.000]   You know, these all, by the way, I would say these are 100% right.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.720]   This is, if I could say what I was looking for when we hire here, it would be exactly
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720]   this.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.760]   I can't remember if it was Keynes or somebody asked a famous economist like that, why he
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.240]   had flipped, plopped on an issue.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.000]   And he said, when I'm presented with evidence, the contradicts, my views, I changed my mind.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   What do you do?
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Right.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.920]   It always drives me crazy that we accuse politicians of being flip floppers.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.960]   In fact, don't you want somebody who will listen to information and then adjust his
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.240]   opinion based on that information?
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.640]   No, I don't want to hear anymore.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.200]   I made up my mind.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.120]   I know, I know what's true.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.800]   In fact, maybe we should use this to elect politicians from now on.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.920]   None of them would get a job.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   Eric Schmidt, for president.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.560]   Talent could come in so many different forms and be built in so many non-traditional ways
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:33.880]   today, hiring officers have to be alive to everyone beside brand name colleges.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.640]   Because when you look at people who don't go to school and make their way in their world,
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.600]   those are exceptional human beings.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.120]   And we should do everything we can to find those people.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.120]   Wow.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.680]   It is part of the debate these days.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.760]   Should you even go to college?
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   Should you incur the debt?
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.520]   And I'm saying this with a college professor in the room.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:03.960]   Should you even incur the debt of a college when, in fact, many people say, including my
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:09.800]   good friend Don Tapscott, all college does is prepare you to, is groom you to be part
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   of that class.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   Don, who's also at a university?
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.200]   Well, he's a professor too.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.480]   I got tenure, man.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.080]   I can say whatever I want now.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.680]   We absolutely, absolutely need to be disrupted like media and retail and other industries.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.680]   We deserve it.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.680]   We are.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.960]   We are, you know, one of the things I learned in universities is we do a lot of talk here
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.680]   about outcomes, but we ascribe the outcomes to what we already want to teach.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.200]   I tried to start a research project where we went in and did ethnographic research in
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.360]   newsrooms and startups to find the skills that are really in the marketplace and then
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.120]   back into what we should teach.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.640]   But I couldn't get anybody to fund it.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.040]   You're actually good because you are, you didn't come from academia.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.320]   Oh, no, I didn't.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.160]   I have a bachelor's degree and I'm teaching master's.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160]   Perfect.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.840]   You're the kind of professor they need because you come from the real world.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   So that's fine.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.840]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.560]   It's the people who, you know, come up through the system, they get all the degrees and they
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.960]   never leave the school.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   They make their entire lives.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:18.400]   It's less the people that also the reward structures that get built around that, right?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.880]   The cementing that occurs.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.280]   Now, there's a reason for tenure.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.840]   I was in a discussion of a bunch of people who had chairs.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.120]   I don't have a chair.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120]   I'm sitting on a ball.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.040]   I barely have lights.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.120]   You know, I'm looking here.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.280]   They turn it off like an Iraq.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.920]   Anyway, anyway, folks, anyway, here.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.600]   So where was I?
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.920]   I will always be a good audience.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.000]   If you want to do a stick, just go right ahead.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.240]   Oh, so the chairs.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.280]   So there was talk about a foundation from saying, you know, let's get rid of this idea
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   of tenure.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.600]   A couple of people in the room said, you know, well, I wouldn't be able to do what I've
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.120]   done because I would have gotten fired long ago.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.560]   And the truth is that when I came here to CUNY, the story of my dean has told, my former
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:10.000]   dean has told in his memoirs, Sarah Bartlett's predecessor, that I quit on the first day
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.240]   on the job.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.640]   I was the first professor hired that was announced at the New York Times.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   I started here.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.080]   I have a faculty meeting that day about the curriculum.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   And I go in and I try to say that professors all need to be trained in new technology.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.680]   And I get shot down and screamed at.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.040]   And I say, oh, my God, I've made a terrible mistake.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.560]   I let it fester for a week.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.440]   I send the dean an email saying we both made a terrible mistake.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440]   I quit my job.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.080]   I don't know what I'm going to do, but I don't want to be the thorn in everybody's side.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.080]   And he came back.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.080]   He said, what are you saying?
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.080]   You idiot.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.240]   I hired you.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.960]   That's the committee from the rest of the university.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.800]   We're going to hire faculty who are going to do this.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   Are you crazy?
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   And he was right.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.560]   And I stayed and thank God I did.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.320]   But I said at the end of that, you know, I was thinking that tenure was a horrible thing.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.880]   Maybe we should talk about that because I saw what it was like to be, you know, to be
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.280]   controversial to try to take a stand that the rest of faculty didn't like and what could
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.480]   happen to you as a result.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.920]   And so for academic freedom, there is a rationale behind tenure.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:12.040]   But as an entitlement, and the other issue we face, and this could be said of me too.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.480]   It would feel the change is so rapidly.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.720]   Should I stay here forever?
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   You know, unless I stay up.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.080]   I thought it was interesting that Nick Christoff, this is, I know we're going up on a tangent
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   here, but he talks.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.920]   That's what we do in the show, Matthew.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.560]   He wrote a whole thing about, you know, how it'd be nice if more people in academia took
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.320]   part in discussions about their field outside of, you know, journals that only five people
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.320]   read.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.160]   And he got a lot of pushback from academics about it.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.960]   But I think his point was a good one that a lot of, there's a lot of potential knowledge
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.840]   and sort of useful debate and points of view that are locked up inside universities and
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840]   inside journals.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:09:00.240]   And it'd be nice if more of that was available.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.160]   There was also a piece in, I think, Foreign Affairs, somebody saying none of the smartest
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.800]   people I know is on Twitter or Facebook.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.880]   And only basically only dumb people are there.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.760]   It wasn't for the foreign affairs.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   Wow.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.000]   That, you know, but that was the old horrible snotty attitude.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.400]   I don't want to talk to the public.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.160]   You know, so all the, you know, it was all the biggest ideas, all the best ideas.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.920]   No, you don't know those.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.640]   You're not good enough to know those.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.720]   Well, F that.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.280]   We don't have a Gina to do a change log here, but the, I'll give you a call.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.600]   There is a new Google plus coming look for it sometime in the next day.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.200]   If you have 4.2, 4.3 will come out.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.760]   Lots of new stuff, non-destructive photo editing across all your devices.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.880]   So you can start an edit on one device and continue or start over on another.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.920]   You can back up full resolution photos from your desktop, edit them on your phone, then
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.680]   finish on your tablet.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.880]   I like that.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:04.400]   New filters, new creative tools, crop, rotate, one touch filters, snap, seed inspired enhancements,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.600]   a single view of all your photos, the all view, and I don't have it yet, so I can't show
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:13.200]   you this, the new all view displays your entire photo library, whether it's on your current
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   device or backed up in the cloud.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.200]   If your library is really large, the app won't show all your photos initially, but if it's
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.760]   more than 10,000 photos, but larger libraries over the next few weeks and an easy way to
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.240]   browse photos by date.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.600]   Swipe through your photos and all view.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.200]   Look for the scroll bar on the right, dragging the scroll bar up or down.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.840]   We'll view you backwards or forwards in time.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.360]   We'll look for an update to, I think there was an update to the Google launcher too if
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.440]   you're on a Nexus or Google Play device.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.240]   I didn't see one yet.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.720]   They're pushing their auto backup software too, right?
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   So there's your change log.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   You know, one story that's on there that I think there's a lot of discussion going on
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:05.320]   online that a federal court just forced Google YouTube to take down the horrible ridiculous
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.400]   anti-Muslim video over a copyright claim.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:17.120]   And so here's something that has major, if awful news value, ridiculous news value,
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:24.680]   what it spurred and inspired, but now copyright is taking it down from public view.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:30.720]   It's a weird, really, that was a really weird, really, because the judges decided, as far
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:38.940]   as I can tell, that because the creator of the movie had altered the work that this
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.320]   actress was involved with, had changed things, had added things, had changed the whole nature
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:52.880]   of the work that effectively copyright reverted to her from the creator.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.080]   And so then if she didn't, you're one, it's even weirder.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.160]   Yeah, it's very strange.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.760]   And the dissenting judge, you could tell thought the whole thing was just ridiculous,
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.320]   at least from the parts that I've been.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.280]   Geez, if I could retain copyright for everything with an editor butchered.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.240]   Yeah, really.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.800]   I'd have, I'd own a lot of worthless stuff, but I'd own it.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.960]   It was a two to one decision, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:30.040]   Actually, the chief judge who voted to pull down the video said, "This is a troubling
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.360]   case.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.280]   Actress Cindy Lee Garcia was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.960]   way she could never foreseen.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.160]   Artistic is a stretch for anything that was in that video."
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.560]   She did say from the very first, "This is not what I thought I was acting in."
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560]   It's not what she, yeah.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.160]   That's a fraud case.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   That's a different case.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.760]   That's not a copyright case.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.120]   So basically, the judge said it was not a work for hire, right?
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.800]   Because that changes the rules.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.520]   So because it was not a work for hire, she only gave an implied license and therefore
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.560]   since they didn't do it.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.960]   She had been cast in a different film, Desert Warrior, but that film was never made, but
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.600]   the footage was then reused with her voice dubbed over with an anti-Muslim.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.840]   It was a sham from the beginning.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.400]   There never was a desert war or a movie, but nobody was going to make the horrible anti-Muslim
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.800]   thing that they made.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.680]   So they just got people to shoot stuff so they could...
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.640]   That does seem like fraud would have been a better.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Fraud, yeah.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   That's fraud.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   I mean, I got a smart.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.800]   Google, by the way, says that they strongly disagree with the ruling and will appeal.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.600]   And Jeff Roberts pointed out in our post, the dissenting judge said that it was a strained
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.000]   interpretation of copyright.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   No kidding.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.560]   And it added that the court had never made a similar ruling in any other case and said
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.840]   that it could cause it to be prior restraint of speech and that public interest would
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.400]   side with Google keeping it up.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.880]   Julie Arrens at Stanford said, "The idea that a copyright is a tool that's going to
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.400]   be used to censor speech we don't like, that's very dangerous."
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.640]   Yeah, it's pretty frightening.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.680]   And the other thing is it's going to bring attention back to this piece of junk stupid
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.480]   thing that was by one schmucky idiot.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.280]   And that'll help us to give him more quiet effect.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.160]   Eric Schmitz, given a million bucks to solve problems through technology, seems like a
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.160]   small, a paltry amount for a man with--
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.320]   Oh, oh, oh, look, look, the gift horse in the mouth will you?
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   Well, I think the art--
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.120]   This is a million technology scales and so a million dollar technology is better than,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.600]   you know, a billion dollars trading in heels.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.600]   Yeah, I grant you that.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.440]   I wrote a post on Medium today arguing that this is part of the out of my trip to the
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:45.880]   valley that-- and I get in trouble with people for this like crazy because I'm saying that
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.800]   I would rather see philanthropists put money into scalability in journalism rather than
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.120]   just supporting more stories.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.360]   And that scalability, innovation, investment in infrastructure and platforms and things
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.200]   like that is where I want to see the money go.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.440]   And so all the nonprofit news things are coming after me and lining that made it right
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   now on Twitter.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   When I think you're--
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.040]   I'm a super popular guy.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.400]   Your point is a good one.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.120]   If millionaires and billionaires just give money to nonprofits, we're not going to see
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.520]   any new either technological innovation or sort of new platforms or new because it was
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   going to fund them.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520]   Exactly.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.000]   And so there's a competition for capital that occurs and the capital I think should
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.400]   go to innovation and scalability.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.960]   But that's boring.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.520]   I should correct myself.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.800]   The Google Now launcher, which was previously available only on Google Play Edition and
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.560]   Nexus devices, now can be downloaded from the store for any device.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.200]   So that actually is a big deal.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:54.280]   They released the launcher that-- this is the beginning of what some have worried about
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:00.640]   that Google would slowly release all the Google service applications to the store.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:07.000]   And even if you didn't-- you could basically replace your crappy Samsung launcher and your
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.360]   crappy Samsung apps with all the Google apps.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   Why is that worrisome?
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   It doesn't worry me.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360]   It's like an improvement.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   It seems like an S5.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:21.680]   I love the S5 and I think it's in the rundown about how half the memory is gone with all
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   the Samsungs.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.440]   This was a complaint I had with the Galaxy S4.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.920]   One of the reasons I didn't use it, I bought a 16-gig Galaxy S4 and I only had nine gig
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:33.240]   free because of the cruft, uninstallable cruft that Samsung put on it.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.360]   It's even worse, it turns out on the S5, although Samsung didn't show off any of that cruft.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.760]   It's eight gigs free.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:47.240]   So there's even more stuff on the Galaxy S5 that you can't remove that messes things up.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.680]   That's to help you, Leo.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   It's not cruft.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   Oh, it's so awesome.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.880]   You want to make your life easier.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.560]   I love the note so much.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.800]   I love that big screen, but I can't use it because I don't want to use Samsung's S4.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.960]   I want to use Google voice.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.640]   I don't want to use Samsung's this and that.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:07.560]   I don't want golf mode in my camera.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:12.320]   So we have been talking about what's absence that happened because it's just so stunning
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.280]   that number, $19 billion.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.480]   We had heard a rumor that Google had offered $10 billion.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.800]   Now word comes from Sundar Pichai.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.600]   No, that's simply untrue.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.240]   He said, "What's up is an exciting product, but we never made an offer to acquire them.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:36.600]   Press reports to the contrary are simply untrue."
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.000]   That's 10 billion would be a lot of money.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   Although there are other reports that they would have paid more than Facebook paid.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.760]   Yeah, apparently not.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.720]   I'm glad to be honest.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:56.960]   It made me nervous when those reports first came out saying they had bid $10 billion and
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.520]   were prepared to match it and all that.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.640]   I thought that's a crazy amount of money.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.720]   I know Google has lots of money, but it's a crazy amount of money.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:10.800]   It's crazy for Facebook, but at least whatever Mark Zuckerberg has talked himself into believing
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.160]   that it's worth that.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.560]   He went to the mobile world and said it was cheap.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   It's worth more.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.320]   You've got to spend that much money.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   You've got to say that.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   You've got to say it.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   20 billion.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   30 billion.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   I've got a deal.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.640]   I don't care how expensive my $9,000 OLED TV was worth.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.720]   It was worth twice the amount.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.280]   I would have paid $20,000 for it.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.360]   Facebook stock has already gone up enough to account for a third of that price.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.120]   That's the important point that people ignore.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:44.720]   The $12 billion of it was already inflated stock.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.440]   What Facebook paid was dilution.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.240]   They diluted their stock value.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240]   It was mostly what they did.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   You know, on point it out when that deal came out that Cisco did very much the same
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.520]   thing in the last sort of movie where they used their stock, which was incredibly highly
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520]   valued.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.360]   They bought, I remember them buying a company, I can't even remember the name of it, they
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.760]   were like two guys and a scribbled network diagram on a napkin.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.160]   They paid two and a half or three billion because why not?
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.960]   It's almost free money.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.960]   Right.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:23.320]   It got something into their HQ and out of everybody else's hands.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:29.560]   A couple of billion in stock three days later, they probably paid for it.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560]   What's happened?
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.120]   We'll be adding voice calls and that's going to be, I think if you think about what it
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:40.200]   is, it's mostly they're paying 42 bucks for per user, for 450 million users.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:47.960]   Facebook itself is worth more than twice that and Instagram, they paid 45 bucks per user.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.920]   So it's really right in there.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.040]   I think they were, I don't know about now, but Mark Zuckerberg said they were adding
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:00.200]   a million users a day in some countries where they've never even heard of Facebook or where
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]   Facebook is not used.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.440]   But the proof is offered all the, that's just, that's just, that's just, that every one
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.640]   of his relatives in India is on what's that?
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.800]   And I watch when you talked about it, even on Twitter, and I talked to people in real
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   life as well.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:21.360]   And people who didn't either know someone or were related to someone in another country
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   had never heard of it.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.440]   And that's why I used it because I was talking to somebody in another country is exactly right.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.640]   If you knew someone or a relative or even someone who you knew who was from a different
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.120]   country, they used it all the time, literally all the time.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.360]   I have an alternative to WhatsApp that people who are a little nervous about it now that
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.240]   it's owned by Facebook might be interested in.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.800]   That's actually great.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.320]   I'm not going to tell you yet because it's going to be my, it's going to be my, my, my,
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.000]   they tool of the week in a, so stay tuned for that.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.040]   Um, a couple more stories and we will get to our tip and tool and number of, uh, the
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.040]   week.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:58.280]   Um, I liked, uh, I thought this was a very good column.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:06.880]   I wanted to just point to it from coding horror, uh, dot com app, apocalypse now.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.200]   Hey, uh, the, uh, the author shows, and I, for some reason the image is not coming in,
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.000]   uh, on my browser right now, but he shows the thing you see every time when you visit,
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.840]   uh, on the browser, a, uh, website for a publication install our free app.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.280]   Gosh, I wish this for, here's an X case.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   It's so right.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   It's not just that.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.800]   It's, you know, we, we, we, we killed the pop up, right?
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.080]   Remember what pop ups were a new window.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.560]   We killed that dead, dead, dead.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.360]   And now site after site after site, I've got it.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   You know, I don't know what it works.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   It works.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.160]   I got to go in and kill these goddamn little.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.120]   Oh, it's so annoying.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.880]   Here's the XKCD cartoon want to visit an incomplete version of our website where you
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.440]   can't zoom down on our app.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.800]   And then you have two choices.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   Okay.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   Or no, but ask me again every time.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.720]   Oh, so true.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.480]   It's so true.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.520]   This was, this was a, I thought a very good article and he really says, you know,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:12.360]   yes, there are a million plus apps on the Android store, but how many of them are any
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360]   good?
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.800]   Most of them, he says 99% of them are awful junk.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.520]   Nobody would ever want.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:25.200]   And what he points out is yes, apps are cheap, but what you, the real cost is your time.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.680]   He says, and I boy identified with this, how many times do you install an app and hover
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.280]   your finger over the uninstall button?
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.240]   Because you just know something's going to happen.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.440]   You're going to say, no, get rid of that app now.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.200]   So it's a great piece.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.680]   You know, the point I think he makes that's really, that really hit me was this sort of
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:49.400]   vision of our at least near term future where, and messaging is a great example where you've
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:56.760]   got multiple sort of siloed, inaccessible, proprietary platform based, you know, things
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.400]   that don't interoperate.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.160]   You can't share things between them.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.600]   It's, it's, it's terrible.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:08.280]   And it, that's the way lots of the internet was before we kind of got standards and before
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.520]   people decided to, I remember early chat with aim and MSN and so on.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.720]   It was, it was terrible because you couldn't talk to someone unless they were, it's like
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.840]   not being able to make a phone call to someone unless they have a specific phone.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.880]   You know, it's, it's ridiculous and we shouldn't stand for it.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:28.560]   More silos when we had this great thing called the worldwide web, the open, easily transportable
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.960]   web.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   It worked so great.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.960]   I blame you, Steve Jobs.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:39.480]   By the way, credit to Jeff Atwood, who is a co-founder of Stack Exchange and is a really
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   great guy.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.920]   And this is a great blog post and I just wish the images were coming in.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   I don't know why they're not.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.720]   Yeah, I don't have them either.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720]   Huh.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.120]   Jeff, what, what'd you do?
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.720]   You messed up your code.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.840]   Blog.codinghorror.com.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.840]   The place to go.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.280]   I just wanted to say, you know, I, I agree.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.520]   Been there, done that.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.400]   Let's bring back the web.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.120]   Such a good idea.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:12.680]   Um, I don't see anything else in less any of you have something you want to see, talk
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   about in the rundown.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:21.520]   We have a first look from gigaohm.com at the Toshiba 13 inch Chromebook video.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520]   Is this from Mobile World Congress?
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.840]   Kevin Tofol, who by the way, is so great.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840]   Good acquisition.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.840]   He's really, really good.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.000]   He's got a, Kevin, Kevin, I think it was Kevin.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   No, somebody got a, a, here's the machine I'm waiting for.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.720]   The affordable pixel is going to be the Acer 720p, which has a touchscreen.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720]   Okay.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.280]   And it's going to have four gigs, not two gigs.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.280]   That's hard to get.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.480]   And it's going to have LT.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.040]   I figure that adds up to about 500.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.120]   Yeah, I wish they'd make a mid-range machine.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120]   That's a working machine.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.560]   It's just, we mentioned this before.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   There's two choices.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.560]   One, two, three, four, four, and one, two, three, four, and one.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   I think it's going to be a very, very important thing.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:18.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   I think it's going to be a very important thing.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   And so I guess it got pulled as a product.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   But 4Gigs and LTE and touchscreen, and you've got a mid-range pixel.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.560]   And 9 hours of battery life, because the pixel's battery life is not so hot.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.560]   Right, right, because now you have Haswell.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:44.560]   And I think Google should make that actually to show what's doable.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.560]   We're going to take a break.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.560]   Come back with it.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.560]   If you wish, Matthew, to provide us with anything you like, a soft-re like,
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.560]   something you want to tell people about, your pick of the week.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   I have a tool of the week, as I mentioned.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   Jeff Jarvis will have a number.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   You saw the Super Bowl ad.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.560]   They actually have some new ads now on the Squarespace site.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   A better web awaits.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   Squarespace, let me show you the new one.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560]   This is no detail.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.560]   It's too small.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   I'm a big fan of Squarespace.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:21.560]   Did were possible.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:28.560]   They say the difference between good and great resides in the details.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.560]   Wow.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   This is some passion and beauty.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.560]   Passion and beauty.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   That goes into what you do.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   It's true.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.560]   It's true.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   Your website is kind of the reflection of who you are and what you do,
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.560]   whether you want to do a blog, whether you're a professional photographer,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:15.560]   and you want to portfolio, if you want to sell, they do it all at Squarespace.com.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.560]   The site looks spectacular.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.560]   The best thing you could do if you go to squarespace.com right now is click the Get Started button.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   You'll see all the templates you could choose from.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.560]   Twenty-five beautiful designer templates.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.560]   You're going to customize this, and it's very easy.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.560]   You don't have to be a JavaScript or CSS junkie to do it.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.560]   You don't have to know anything, just point and click your way to a totally gorgeous website.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   All of them are e-commerce enabled, which is nice.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.560]   All of them are mobile responsive.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   That means they look good at any size.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.560]   Once you set up the site, you have two weeks to play with it for free.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.560]   You can import all your content, really see what it looks like.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   Change templates at your whim.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.560]   Use their logo design tool, which is very sweet.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   If you don't have a designer on staff, you can design a really great-looking logo.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:07.560]   They have wonderful apps, the Metric app for iPhone and iPad just came out,
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:13.560]   which lets you check site stats like page views, unique visitors, social media followers.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560]   You can blog right from their blog app.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.560]   You can approve comments and so forth.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.560]   Just gorgeous.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.560]   The hosting is done, and the software too, and the price is right.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   When you sign up for a year as low as $8 a month, including a custom domain,
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560]   you can even sell a product and accept donations.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   Great.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.560]   If you want to do a cash wedding registry or a school fund drive,
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   if you want to do full e-commerce, $24 a month, that's all.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   They don't take a cut.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   You can sell unlimited products, real-time carrier shipping, label printing via shipstation,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.560]   integrated accounting via zero.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.560]   You get the domain name and everything.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.560]   Unplus unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth,
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.560]   unlimited contributors, squarespace.com.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.560]   I just want you to try it.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.560]   Go there right now.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.560]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.560]   If you decide to buy and you see the price is right,
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.560]   I do ask that you use our offer code Twig2 and you'll save 10%.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.560]   That's why a year or more is a really good deal.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.560]   Use the offer code Twig and the number two because we're in the second month, February,
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.560]   at squarespace.com.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560]   That's what you've got to be known.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.560]   Go ahead, Jack.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.560]   You had a good time at the Boston Park Plaza.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.560]   Oh, now how do we know that?
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   Because we know that from Twitter.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.560]   I mean, how to nice little conversation from the one Twitter, very smart hotel.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.560]   Hey, Matthew.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560]   Never talked to a hotel before.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560]   Yeah, that was an interesting.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.560]   They said, did you enjoy your stay?
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.560]   It took them a while because I think that was February 7th.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560]   Oh.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   So wait a minute.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560]   So you went to the hotel.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560]   You stayed there.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.560]   Did they ask for your Twitter handle when you checked in?
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   No, what have you been there for an assignation?
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.560]   I checked in on four square.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.560]   Oh.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560]   So I guess I'll be checking.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   All right.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.560]   But they knew to go to your Twitter account.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.560]   I think I shared it on Twitter.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   He's Matthew I on Twitter.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.560]   And what did they say?
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   Just thanks for coming to stay with us.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.560]   Did you enjoy the conference?
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   [laughter]
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.560]   And Matthew being the nice Canadian said sure did.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.560]   Oh, yes.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.560]   Thank you very much.
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560]   Thank you.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.560]   Thanks.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.560]   [laughter]
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.560]   Actually, I love Matthew's Twitter feed.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.560]   I'm just reading your tweets now.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560]   Fred Wilson on Bitcoin.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   I always feel good buying when there's blood in the streets in any market.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   That was a good one.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.560]   I like it.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560]   Yeah, Fred.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   Reddit's adding a new real-time reporting feature.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560]   I thought that was an interesting one.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.560]   I got a lot of feedback, mostly negative on that.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.560]   They've got a new feature that basically allows you to live blog a breaking news event.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.560]   Oh.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:56.720]   And you basically become the editor of that live blog and then you can allow other people
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.760]   or bring in contributions from elsewhere into that live blog.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.560]   So obviously everyone brought up the Boston bombing and how they--
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.560]   I got it wrong.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.400]   But, you know, so did CNN.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.600]   So I still think more people doing those things is better.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.400]   I keep going back to what Jay Rosen has said, you know, journalism gets better when more
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.600]   people do it.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.800]   And so, yeah, I'm sure there's going to be screw-ups.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.960]   I'm sure there's going to be mistakes.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.160]   But we have those every day in the regular media.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.280]   So why shouldn't Reddit be part of it?
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.280]   And I-- you know, you use this example, the Ukrainian conflict Reddit live updates.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.960]   This is a perfect place to do it.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   Why not?
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:40.280]   They actually have a great Syrian Civil War subreddit that's run by a guy.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:46.120]   I think he's a law student and he runs two or three other subreddits, one about Venezuela.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:47.280]   And they're excellent.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.760]   Like the Syrian Civil War one is really good.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.440]   I would say it's one of the best resources about the Syrian Civil War in any media form,
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.320]   you know, traditional professional amateur or whatever next to Brown Moses and his blog
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.920]   and places like that.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:04.920]   It's quite well done.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.520]   Wikipedia has done that for a little bit for a while.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   I mean--
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.520]   This is a similar model.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.320]   I think crowdsourcing news is not a bad thing at all.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.960]   As long as you understand the potential pitfalls.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   Right.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   Right.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.800]   But you know, a human mob can form anywhere, anytime.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.800]   Sure.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.200]   And I think that lots of people said, well, they're going to make lots of mistakes and
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.840]   how could that possibly be better?
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:34.120]   But if you look at what happens on Twitter, lots of those mistakes are corrected and hoaxes
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.840]   are corrected a lot faster than they are in traditional media.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.160]   So you've got benefits and disadvantages.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.960]   Yes, there are more errors, but they happen faster and can be corrected faster.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.240]   I completely agree.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.600]   And I think when it works, it works so well that it just justifies any potential issues
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.920]   that come up.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:57.920]   So there's a tip.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.640]   Follow Matthew on Twitter.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   M-A-T-H-E-W-I.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.480]   One T.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.480]   Is that a hard way?
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.920]   Matthew slaps people like nuns with rulers to teach them.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.920]   It's one T.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.880]   Is that how you spell it for real though, Matthew?
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.680]   Yeah, it's only one T.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:18.160]   Is there a story behind that, Matt, too?
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.360]   No, not a comprehensible one.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.320]   No, my mother, I asked her, you know, when I was old enough to figure out that it was
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.560]   weird why she chose one.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.560]   And all she could come up with was that she didn't want me to be called Matt.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.960]   She hated the name Matt.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.560]   Well, now if you're called Matt, it's really confusing.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.560]   Well, right.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:40.760]   And I said, you know, you can't say the name, Matthew, so that it only has one T. So anyone
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.080]   who only hears it is obviously going to call me Matt.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.680]   So that didn't really work.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.800]   She actually used to people would call our house and say is Matt there and she would say,
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.160]   no one by that name lives here.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.920]   Oh, you would hang up.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.520]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.240]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   That was fun.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.280]   Well, I've known you for I don't know how long years and I didn't know.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.200]   This first time I've noticed there was one T.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.200]   Oh, really?
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.800]   I felt sorry for the guy who was at Matthew.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800]   I was two T's.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:14.920]   Yeah, I think he's actually left Twitter because it's got too much people are replying him
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.920]   and said to me, well, anything else you want to plug before we wrap up here?
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.880]   I can't remember if I mentioned this before, but I've got I use a the photo Google photo
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.200]   backup thing reminded me of it.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.000]   I use a service called Trove box.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:36.760]   It was originally called open photo and I do all I backup every photo from my devices
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:43.080]   to that service and then one of the interesting things about them is they integrate with Amazon's
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   S3.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:49.520]   So if you have an account there, which I do, it automatically, you know, dumps all that
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.320]   stuff and that's three repositories.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.600]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.000]   So you're not relying on them for storage.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.080]   They basically just handle the uploading and handle all the other stuff and then you can
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.440]   go to your Trove box site and see all the photos and, you know, turn them into albums
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.520]   or share them or whatever.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.040]   It's quite simple, but it really it works really well.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.040]   You prefer that.
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:17.440]   See, I'm nowadays Facebook, Google, Microsoft, everybody wants to give you free backup space.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440]   And I do do that.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:24.400]   I actually back them up to Dropbox and to Google and in some cases to Facebook as well.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:30.520]   But I like to have one that isn't kind of isn't associated with a specific platform
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:34.480]   that is just, you know, me and Amazon kind of deal and that's where my stuff is.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.480]   So in case something happens for whatever reason.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   For the longest time I was using backupify and they've kind of slowly dwindled in terms
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.960]   of things that they do.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.120]   Yeah, I use them too.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.400]   So I'm looking for something else.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   Trove box.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.920]   I'll have to check it out.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.560]   T-R-O-V-E-B-O-X.com.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   Thank you, Matthew.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.680]   A number, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.000]   So my friend Chuck Martin, an expert in mobile put up an interesting post on LinkedIn today
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:06.600]   with data from Monatate that says that in the last quarter, in the Christmas quarter,
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:14.000]   average order size from Android exceeded average order size from iPhones in e-commerce.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.960]   $136 versus $126 reversing a previous trend, which I just found interesting because I hear
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.240]   complaints about, well, yeah, there's a lot more Android than iPhone.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.560]   I make more money from iPhone.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.640]   I hear people say who make apps and such.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.440]   So I found that interesting.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:31.560]   It was at $2 billion in sales.
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:40.640]   Cyber Monday was the highest grossing online shopping day in history.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.040]   One out of three visits to leading e-commerce websites now comes from a smartphone or tablet.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:52.200]   And the tablet average size, as opposed to the $126 for the phones, the tablet average
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.840]   size order is $153.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.360]   So it's more than anybody?
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   Wow.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.760]   So that makes sense.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.840]   Tablet users are affluent, lazy people.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:05.840]   Yes.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.360]   And they order more online.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360]   Yes.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   Actually, that makes sense.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.520]   That's why it numbers a week.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.400]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.840]   We talked yesterday about secure messaging platforms on security now.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.680]   And spent some time talking about Telegram.
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:30.200]   Telegram is a Russian secure messaging platform for Android and others that is funded by
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:36.560]   Pavel Durov, who is according to Mark Millian, the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, and claimed
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.120]   a million new users when WhatsApp was sold.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:42.760]   A lot of people fleeing WhatsApp apparently because they don't trust Facebook.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.320]   I don't know why.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.560]   But what Instagram makes a big deal about being a secure encrypted service.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.360]   But Steve's analysis and many others, as it turns out, is that this is far from secure.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360]   It's just bizarre.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.600]   And he doesn't recommend it.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.000]   But he did mention, and this all came up because of one of the critics of Telegram
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.160]   is a well-known cryptographer, security expert named Moxie Marlin Spike.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.600]   He has the most Dickensian name.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.800]   What a wonderful name.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.200]   Yeah, I don't know if it's his real name, but it is.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.640]   It's a great handle.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.840]   And Moxie has an open source implementation of security.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.640]   And his company, OpenWisper Systems, offers a free secure messenger, which Steve says is
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.200]   very good.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.200]   I installed it.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.520]   In fact, I found it not only free, it's easy to use.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.440]   It offers all the features of WhatsApp, group messaging, audio, video, text, pictures.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.440]   But it's very easy to use.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.800]   And in fact, I like it so much.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.000]   I replaced my standard SMS app.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.280]   You could do this on Android, which is really great.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.360]   And made text secure my default.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:51.560]   So texting looks like regular texting on text secure, unless you exchange a key with somebody.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:58.240]   And then all of your conversations are protected by strong encryption, stored on the phone
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.920]   encrypted, never spends any time on their systems, servers.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.360]   I mean, it's true, strong encryption.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.920]   And I have to say, I've started using it now as my SMS.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.840]   It's really great.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.440]   And it does everything WhatsApp does.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.280]   And the same company, OpenWisper, does a phone service called Red Phone that is a secure voice
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   communications.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:26.520]   So if for some reason you're fleeing WhatsApp, this is a great alternate choice that is,
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.520]   in fact, secure.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.400]   Is it just for Android?
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.440]   Right now, just for Android, they say they're doing an iOS version of it.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.080]   And the nice thing about it is that the encryption technology is open and freely available.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.520]   You can federate with them.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:47.920]   So others could write apps that work with text secure using federation, which I even like
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.920]   better.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.520]   It means you're not stuck with just one implementation of it.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.680]   And Moxie is really one of the good people.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.600]   So this is a great choice.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.840]   Text secure, highly recommended.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.840]   My friends, we've come to the end of another this week in Google.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.760]   I'm so glad you could be here, Matthew Ingram.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760]   Thank you.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.760]   Yes, thank you.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.760]   Thanks for having me.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760]   Really appreciate it.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.280]   And anything you want to plug?
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   Just everybody should read giga-ohm.com.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.480]   Yes, read giga-ohm all the time.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.800]   Make it your homepage.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.800]   We do.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.160]   I just, giga-ohm is just awesome.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.600]   And it's not just you.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:27.920]   It's all the other great people there, including, of course, Omalaq.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.920]   But it's really become for me a go-to site.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.880]   We have a great team.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:34.880]   Great team.
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.800]   And very insightful stuff.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.520]   It's more than just breaking news.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.520]   You learn a lot.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.520]   You really do.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.000]   And we do have some of our newer writers.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.640]   Cina Brewster, for example, writes a lot about 3D printing and sort of really cutting
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.640]   edge stuff.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.160]   I find it fascinating.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.840]   I always learn something from her.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.480]   She writes about drones and stuff like that.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.600]   It's just, it's incredibly fascinating.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.280]   We have a lot of people from Mogega Om on this show because it's some of the best tech
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.440]   journalists out there.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.440]   It's really great.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.160]   And I don't know, Cina, but I will look her up.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160]   Or him.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   It's her.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   It's her, yeah.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.160]   She's a she.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:25.280]   Jeff Jarvis is, of course, the man in charge at the City of Receiving New York runs the
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   entire place.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.080]   Ah, well, I have.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.600]   Professor of Journalism at CUNY.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.080]   He's also the author of Public Parts and Blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.080]   Thank you, Jeffrey.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.120]   I'm hoping that Gina will be back next week.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.120]   I have no reason to think otherwise.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.760]   We miss Gina, but yeah, she's the greatest.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.080]   It's nice to have people like Matthew.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.640]   We can call on though.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.640]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:57.200]   We do this week in Google 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern Time 2100 UTC on Wednesday afternoons.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.200]   Please stop by.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   Please join us.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200]   We love having you here.
