[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   Hello.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   Good to be here.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   He's wearing his Surfrider T-shirt.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   Yes.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   I like it.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.520]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.640]   Also looking better than ever thanks to Google talk of all things, Jeff Jarvis from the
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   City University of New York.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   Look at that.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   Colors good.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   You're on the Pixel.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   You're using G-Talk.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   Why didn't we do this before?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.560]   Well you tell me.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   I think we thought that the codec that G-Talk was using wasn't very good, but it looks really
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   good.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.200]   Yeah, and the reason for this is so that show understands is that it turns out my university
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.160]   must have put up a new firewall and it disadvantages Skype.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   So that got to 15 frames a second max.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.680]   And last week you were just blur.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   You were blurr.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.480]   So now thanks to the good work of Chad and Russell on the Twig staff.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.880]   Last night we figured all things out and tried a lot of things to try this and I think Twig
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.480]   is now in Google.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.440]   And just for the technical info, the drivers weren't working before and it also freaked
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   me out that it used to be that you could hit the Google talk button and it goes straight
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.440]   into what we're using.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320]   Then they replaced it with the Hangout button.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   Wow, that's great.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.960]   I kind of got shy of that and said, you know what, we really shouldn't use this product
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.160]   because they could change it at any time.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.280]   But that was another problem and I forgot is that we couldn't send video back initially,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120]   but now that was fixed at some point.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   So Blackmagic updated their drivers.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   Blackmagic did it.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.360]   Okay, so I think we may start, we may at least have this as a, because we don't have
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.640]   to use Skype, we may have this as a backup on our shows because it's...
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.040]   I think the other thing you should work on long term is WebRTC.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   Because that's a standard.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.000]   Client that you can control and then you can do neat things with it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.280]   We shall play with it.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   Also here.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.240]   Or, or we won't have this at all and we'll just, like Gina, see the show up here.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.080]   I think Gina should be doing the show via...
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   Wow, look at that.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.840]   She has joined the collective.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.320]   Screen captain.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   Gina Trapani is here or also known as 8 of 9.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.000]   And her blog is smarterword.org.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.360]   No, no, she's not 7 of 9.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   She's 8.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   Very important.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.640]   7's already taken.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   So nice to see you.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   So you got your glass.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   I did.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   Good to see you too.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   What do you think?
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   I look like a dork.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   That's what I think.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   No, you know what?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.280]   I'm rapidly getting used to it.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   You remember I was saying it was like the segue?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.920]   It's not that bad.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.560]   I'm rapidly getting used to it.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   People keep saying that.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   It's not that bad.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   This thing.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.360]   I don't want people to say that about me.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.000]   I don't want to be just not that bad.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600]   Gina, you've got a microphone strapped to the side of your face.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   The Madonna mic with that is complete.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   I have so much gear on my head right now.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.240]   I've got gear buds.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   I've got the mic.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   I've got the glasses.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   There's a lot going on.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   I think you need an oxygen tube or something too just to complete it.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   Yes.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   So we did get our finally.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   I got our email.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.000]   Remember Jason Howell was at I/O last year.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.400]   And he registered number 737.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   He got the email today.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   And I made an executive decision.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.760]   And I gave him the glass because he's got a newborn.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.040]   People with newborns should jump to the head of the line with Google Glass.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.000]   He's pretty happy about that.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.680]   I'll pay for it.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.200]   I'm not going to make it pay for it.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   But I tried to scobles glass.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.080]   Scobles on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.800]   And I got the idea.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.400]   I don't think I'd wear it a lot.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   What do you think?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.560]   Remember Scobles said he's going to wear it all the time for the rest of his life.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   What do you think Gina?
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.280]   Yeah, I'm definitely not in the Scoble camp.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.560]   I'm not like, oh, I can't imagine going through another day of my life without this.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.680]   But I do think that this is kind of interesting technology.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.920]   I mean, I've gotten awesome videos and pictures of my daughter.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.640]   I love getting text messages and just being able to glance up and reply really quickly.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.800]   I love not having to mess with my phone.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.240]   The nav is really cool.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.800]   But I have to tell you, if you're in the least bit self-conscious and you don't live in San
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.240]   Francisco or New York or LA, you really think twice about going out on these videos.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   I mean, I wear, and this is the other thing, I don't wear glasses on a regular basis.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.480]   So this is kind of a new thing for me.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.000]   I wear sunglasses a lot.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.480]   And in fact, I put the sunglasses in.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.240]   I've snapped them into glass and I feel sort of more comfortable with going out with them
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   that way.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.560]   But yeah, on the drive home from LA, I was talking about this online.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.480]   I stopped at a rest stop where the baby and whatever, and a small kid, a child, like an
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   eight or nine year old, was totally staring at me.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.720]   I mean, why is that woman disfigured?
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.800]   Yeah, like kind of getting dragged along by her dad.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.600]   She was just kind of like, what is that?
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   What is wrong with that woman, Mummy?
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.600]   I was like, I'm scaring like a little girl.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   Like, I don't know if that's a bug or a feature or what.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   You know, I don't know.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   That's a whole feature of through glass or first gen, at first geno.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.080]   Are you willing to show on the show the best through glass picture I have seen anywhere
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   yet?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   Absolutely.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.080]   Oh, is it on Jean?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   Is it on Jean's?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   Absolutely.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   Yeah, go to the rundown.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   Go to the rundown.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   There's a picture there.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.520]   It says, as clinician points, it says best photo ever.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   Oh my gosh.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:56.040]   This is what you want to see because that's the mommy's view of Etta.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   Exactly.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   What's Etta thinking right now?
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.440]   Well, her first words are going to be okay glass, right?
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.200]   Well, what you're really getting is what a baby looks like when she sees her mama in
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.440]   a way that you really wouldn't get a camera in front of your face.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.720]   She's looking at you and she's pure joy.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.440]   How did you share that out to the public?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.920]   Because I thought the class would only share the pictures out.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   Oh, no.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.400]   I was playing with Matt McGeek as he got his on Monday and I would have to watch him and
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.560]   take pictures and stuff.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.480]   And he couldn't share anything out to the public only to extended circles.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.080]   He hadn't set it up right probably.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   Yeah, you can.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   If you go to google.com/myglass, which is basically where you do all the kind of advanced configuration
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   under sharing contacts, you can add any circle, any individual, and one of the options is public.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   So you can add public.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   Excellent.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   That's a baby's great.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   It's so it shares.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.800]   It shares automatically, right?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.280]   Well, instant upload is turned on by default and everything's private by default.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   Okay.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.200]   So any video or picture I take is instant uploaded up to Google plus.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.520]   So I've been doing a lot of that where everything gets instant uploaded up and then when I'm
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.760]   out my computer, I look at, oh, okay.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.520]   And then I share kind of curate share.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.680]   But that one, any images that you see with the through glass hashtag, somebody has shared
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.440]   directly from their glass, you know, right after an attack.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   Which speaking of which I started a tumble blog.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.040]   Oh, I'm using through glass pictures.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   What's it called?
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   It's on the rundown as well.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.520]   It's through glass.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.480]   Oh my dot tumbler dot.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   I like it.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.320]   I'm following it right now.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.600]   You know, there have been a couple of cool videos.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.480]   There was one of a guy dunking a basketball.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.320]   Ryan Warner, who's actually in the chat room right now, he had glass on during his graduation
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   and he got great footage of walking across the stage and accepting his degree and looking
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   at on the crowd, which is really cool.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.520]   I was like, wow, I would love to have that record of my graduation.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.680]   The video video features really cool, although watching it, if the person is moving, it can
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.520]   get a little kind of you can feel a little bit.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   You know, kind of watching.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.640]   So yeah, a little motion, motion sickness.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.680]   So this is a fairly trivial use though.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.240]   If you say it's a head mounted camera, big deal.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.600]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.760]   You're absolutely right.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.760]   This is the thing.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.840]   There aren't a whole lot of apps for this right now.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.280]   Like I said, I like getting text messages and phone calls through glass.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   It's convenient.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.440]   You don't have to play your phone out.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.760]   Nav is great.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.360]   You know, taking videos and pictures is great.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   The Apple genius is looking at this guy.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   What the hell?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   But you're right, Leo.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   Go ahead, let Gita.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.360]   I was going to say that when I wake up in the morning, I'm not like, oh, I can't proceed
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.640]   in my day if I don't have glass on, right?
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.520]   Which I do kind of feel like that about my smartphone, right?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.760]   If I lose my smartphone, that's a problem.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.320]   Tell me, tell it, describe for people who haven't tried it what you're, what it looks
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.760]   like to you as you're wearing this.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.320]   So when it's on or just.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   Yeah, what are you seeing?
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   What do you, what does it look like?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   What does it feel like?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   Give us the, I've worn it now.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.200]   So I kind of know, but I'd like to hear in your words, what is the experience so that
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.360]   people can kind of experience what it's like to wear it.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   And what do you see?
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   How does it feel?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   How does it look?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.040]   I mean, when it's on your head and it's not in the screen, isn't on, there's, there's
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.960]   this clear piece of glass right above your right eye, which you can see and you can see
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.920]   through it, but you're aware that it's there.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   It's in your peripheral vision.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.600]   It's a periphery though, because you can look, I mean, mostly you're looking under it.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.960]   You just can see something there.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   Exactly.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   That's right.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   That's right.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   Most of you are looking under it, but, but you, but you can, if you look up at all, you'll,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   you can see through it.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.800]   You can wake it by either tilting your head up if you have that enabled or tapping the
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.880]   touchpad and then you can see, and you can actually see this, you can see the screen.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   Come on.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.240]   Let's see if I get out of the glass or you can see that actually in, in the shot.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   Scoville was at pains to say, you see people know if you're looking at glass because they
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   can see the screen.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   If it's at the proper angle.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   Right.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.360]   If it's at the proper angle, exactly.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.280]   So the, so the screen is just, it's pretty small.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.760]   It looks as if it's a couple of feet in front of me, right?
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.000]   It doesn't look right up in my face.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   It looks, it's a couple of feet in front of me.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.680]   It does look like a projector, right?
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.240]   So if the, if the, if the glass is slipped a little bit, you'll see the red, green, blue,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.920]   you kind of get the sense that it's projected.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.600]   It is pretty crisp in sunlight, which there's a lot of here in San Diego.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.240]   It's, it is difficult to see.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.160]   You kind of want to look at a dark object in order to see, to see the screen well.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.520]   The user interface is very nice.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.680]   It's very Google now like you swipe through cards using the touchpad on the side.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.200]   It's very smooth.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.360]   And honestly, and I think that's global was doing this with you on, on Sunday Leo, they,
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.280]   Google obviously learned a lesson from Android.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.440]   And you couldn't take a screen, a screenshot with glass.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.760]   You can screen cast whatever's happening on your glass onto your phone, right?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.600]   So he had his phone, uh, replaying what I was seeing.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   That's really, really nice.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.080]   And in fact, sometimes I use that to, to look at videos because it's a, it's clearer
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.600]   and larger on my phone than it is on glass.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.520]   If I'm like, Oh, I want to share this video to the public, but let me just make sure that
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.560]   I haven't, you know, glued to any, you know, I don't know, phone numbers or personal information
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   is something I don't want public.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.040]   I would look at it on my phone, which is nice.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.600]   Um, it comes with, it comes with, you know, shades that you can pop in.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   Uh, it also comes with a clear, a clear one of these if you're doing, if you're out and,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   you know, if it's raining or if you're doing athletics, um, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   What was your question?
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.760]   No, it's just that besides taking pictures and videos, clear value.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.640]   Are you using it for informational purposes so far?
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.480]   You know, I turned on the New York Times app, which is there are only two third party apps
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.400]   available path, which I don't use, uh, and New York Times.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.920]   New York Times every hour or so shows me headlines and I turned it off because I don't need,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.000]   yeah, I don't need headlines on my field division every, every couple hours.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.320]   You don't need searches with it.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   I have done searches.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.080]   Uh, you know, mostly all the searches I've done so far.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.600]   It's only been a couple of days that I've had it or just been to try it out.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.840]   I haven't, I haven't seriously said, you know, like, hey, glass, I did say I have the navigation.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.440]   I have said, you know, navigate San Diego, navigate to, you know, here there, or wherever
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.360]   navigation is really, really nice and helpful.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   Um, and a really cool feature that it has, if you're in navigation and you're in walking
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.120]   mode, glass actually knows which way your head is turned.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.520]   So it will tell you which way to turn based on which way your head is turned, which is
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.200]   really, yeah, which is really neat bit of, uh, of tech.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.760]   Uh, yeah, there's a couple of really, a couple of smart things about it.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.120]   There's zero voice recognition.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.840]   So, and Leo, you saw this on Twitch too.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.640]   If you say, okay, glass and then someone next to you is speaking, it'll pick up voice rejection.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.720]   You should, yeah, you mean voice rejection.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.560]   So yeah, it doesn't, it, anybody's voice will work.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   Anybody's voice will work.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.200]   It doesn't know your voice.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.560]   So if you tap your, if you tap your, uh, temple and somebody says, okay, glass, take
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   a picture.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.800]   You're, they're going to do it.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   It'll do it.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   It'll do it.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.100]   Um, it does have, there's a proximity sensor on it.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.280]   So it knows if it's on your head or not and it will sleep automatically when you take it
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   off your head.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.020]   Um, I think it does that just to preserve battery, which it really needs to because the battery
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.020]   is terrible.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.460]   Also, it will run down your phone's battery pretty quickly.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.560]   I mean, this is very much a developer prototype.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:09.240]   It sends text messages with a signature that says sent from glass, which is, eh, don't
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.240]   know if I really want that.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   I would like to turn it off.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.880]   I should, I should poke around and see if I cannot.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.320]   I'm not sure that you can right now.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   I've had text messages get sent twice.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.400]   I've had text messages take a long time to get sent.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.520]   So like things are buggy, although there's an update that just pushed out today that I
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   just got sent.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   I've got a C5 update already.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   So what happened?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   What does that do?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.880]   Um, I think there were just a couple of like stability improvements and, um, it says brings
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.080]   loads of new features and announcements.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   What?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.680]   I don't know about all that.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.400]   I actually should look at the, it looked closely.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.440]   I haven't looked closely at the change log.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.680]   Uh, it felt like everything was just like make sharing smoother, which sharing should
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   work.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.440]   Incoming G plus notifications.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.600]   Let's turn those off.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.160]   Incoming hangout notifications.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   Let's turn those off.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.360]   Transcription of queries and messages is now wicked fast.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   Okay.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.520]   Why long press to search from anywhere in the UI.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.600]   International number dialing.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.760]   Hop animation on disallowed swipes in the UI.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   What the?
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.120]   So it'll hop or something, right?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.600]   So if you, so, okay, so let's see.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.240]   Uh, so if you try to do something, I just got, I just got a Google plus notification.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.360]   So if I try to swipe it, it'll work.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   It's working.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.320]   New on head detection calibration flow.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   Show serial device, serial number on device info card, more reliable estimation of battery
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.200]   charge, new recipient list mosaic.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.600]   That's not what I would call, uh, exciting new features and enhancements.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   I mean, it's, it's a bug.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   Yeah, it's a bug.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   It's a bug fix release.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   That's the, that was my goal.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   So Gina, how does it communicate with the phone?
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.480]   Uh, it's Bluetooth tethering.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.080]   So it Bluetooth pairs with their phone, uh, using them, the my glass app is really, uh,
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   is really important.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   I can't, I haven't tried, I don't know if this talks to iPhone at all, if it works
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.880]   with the iPhone or what, but the my glass companion app, uh, links to your glass, you
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.680]   know, same Bluetooth pairing process that each shows you a pin on your phone, shows
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.840]   you a pin on glass.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.360]   You tap to say yes, the pins match.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.720]   Um, but it will use your phones data.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.360]   Uh, it will use your phones data.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   Yep.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.400]   And it uses your phone's battery too.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.200]   So it can run down your phone's battery as well.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.640]   All of this and more is why I gave it to Jason.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.480]   Jason's howling.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.680]   Uh, it's a, it's a developer prototype.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.960]   Like I think it's really important for everyone.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.320]   And this is not how the final consumer product is going to look.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.480]   This is, this is my, my one line review is there's something interesting here about the
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   heads up display.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.080]   Google did some nice work with the UI, but this has a long way to go, long way to go.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   Robert, Robert,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.960]   I compared it to the feeling he got when he first got an apple to computer when he was
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   a kid.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   Like it couldn't do much either, but this, you could see this was the beginning of a
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   revolution.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   Like there's something here.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.600]   You, you, Miss developer queen.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.120]   Uh, does this inspire anything in you yet about things that you could, uh, imagine making
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   for it?
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.480]   Well, yeah, you know, honestly, I've been thinking a lot about notifications, um, from
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.760]   the, all my apps from think of, from to do text.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.360]   So I've been thinking, and I've been looking at the API, I got whitelisted to get on API
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.280]   access, uh, which is what everybody does when they get glass.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.560]   So I haven't dove in yet, but I'm interested in kind of just basic stuff that you'd imagine.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.320]   So like on a, on a to do list, if I, if I, um, you know, mark coordinates, I'm going
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   to pick up milk at, at Ralph's, you know, when I'm near Ralph's glass should pop up and say,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.360]   Hey, you're supposed to pick up milk, that kind of thing.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.400]   Uh, we'll think up, you know, if there's a new, a new insight that's high, you know,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   high importance of an emphasis or emphasis I wanted to push to glass and say, Oh, I've
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.280]   got, you know, got something, you know, worth looking at here.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.560]   But you know, you have to build with glass, you have to be very judicious about what you're
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   showing, right?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.600]   It has to be very timely, very relevant, very compelling or else, you know, your users
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.840]   are going to shut the app off.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.240]   That's why I don't think the New York times make sense.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   The only time that the New York times had like make sense for me is like the Boston bombings,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.560]   for example, like, big events in New York.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.760]   I think today we had killer rainstorms.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.800]   So, so this morning, the first time ever, and friends with seven of my friends too,
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.080]   the phone went off when I hit the city with a, with a, like a, you know, civil defense
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   warning sound.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   I've never had this before.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.080]   Flash flood warning till 9 to 15.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   And it was weird.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.360]   I've never seen that before.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.040]   And so, so you can see that kind of alert.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.200]   On the class would be fine.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   All right.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   Next question.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.240]   What application do you most wish would, would do an adaptation for glass?
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.440]   Well, I mean, glass is very heavily integrated into Google plus.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.880]   And I've so consequently, I've been using Google plus a little more, but I spend most
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.920]   of my time on Twitter.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.240]   So I'm, I mean, the most obvious ones I want are like Twitter, the social apps that I spend
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.080]   the most time in Twitter, four, square.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.800]   I would like to listen to podcasts on this on glass, you know, that that would be really
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   nice.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   By the way, the, how's the bone thing work?
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.200]   It works really, really well.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   There's a speaker on the back.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.640]   It's, it's, it's a bone conducting speaker.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.440]   It's right up kind of against the back.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.920]   You know, they're bone behind your ear and it sounds surprisingly clear, much better than
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   I thought that it would.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.080]   I could very easily listen.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   I probably wouldn't listen to music, but I could very easily listen to podcasts.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.560]   And that's something I would love to do.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.080]   So, so pocket casts, I would like for you to build some glassware for me.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.880]   That's interesting.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.240]   I mean, I want to do, you know, I, I wanted to do anything that I do on my smartphone.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.040]   That's, that's a reasonably small amount of swiping.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.840]   You know, for square check-ins seems like an obvious thing, right?
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.720]   I'm sure Google attitude is going to be, it's going to be built into this very quickly.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.620]   I would like, you know, I like things like four square explorer, like, you know, four
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.240]   of your friends have been this restaurant you're passing by, that kind of thing.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.760]   I would, I would actually be really interested in that.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.840]   So all the kind of major apps I really would like to see.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.480]   I'm so glad you're there first.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   And enjoy.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:08.200]   I'm going to go over and see, you know, see what I can see if I can come up with something
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.720]   kind of fun, just, just to, just to see how, how easy it is.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.160]   So, so Leo, I used to be the guy who sent stuff back.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Yes, Mr. Reeboxer.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.440]   You're the guy who, oh, Pixel, get out of my way.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.600]   I didn't send it back.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   I didn't send it back.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Oh, my God, glass.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   I didn't send it back.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.160]   I didn't, I just not going to, I'm not, I'm paying for it.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.080]   I just think there's somebody who'd be more, it'll be more of, more used to.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.120]   And I don't, I would use it for five minutes and I would put in a drawer.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.080]   So like every gadget of yours has not every gadget.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.680]   No, no, the hangout feature is pretty cool.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.000]   And in fact, we can, Chad and I could try one out if you want to see it.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Oh, sure.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   It's not a very good view here.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I mean, it's really, it's just my messy desk.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Can we do that?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Really Chad?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Can we do it?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.640]   So, so I'm watching my Google+ stream right here and then Gina is going to.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.960]   Okay, glass.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.800]   Hang out with Chad Johnson.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.240]   Oh, that was scary.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.200]   And then now let me watch my stream for it to come in here.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   Oh, look.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.680]   Wow.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.200]   This is kind of amazing.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   And then let me re-use.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.000]   And what it sees is not you, but it sees what you're seeing.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   See what I see.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   So it's going to see my screen, right?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.760]   Chad's going to turn off audio so I don't hear both.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.240]   So this is kind of boring.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.840]   This is just my messy desk.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   There's my keyboard.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   Let's see.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   You can look around the room.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.480]   Yeah, look around the room here.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.240]   I've got a picture of the Apple one up on my wall here.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   I don't know if you can see that.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.080]   Got my little audio box here.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.280]   Yeah, I've got lots of cords, messy cords going on.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.640]   And it's funny outside because it's San Diego.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.600]   I don't know if I come in on the screen, you could probably see a little better.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.960]   Yeah, you can see the rundown behind my Skype window.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   Oh, look.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   It's recursion.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   It's such a look.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   Recursion.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.120]   I got like, I got the old school.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.800]   That's a programmer talking.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.640]   The old school keyboard here.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.760]   But yeah, so if I were standing on top of a beautiful cliff looking out over the ocean,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.040]   or if I was holding the baby in front of me and skyping with grandma, the hangouts is
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.200]   really cool.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   And I can see Chad.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.800]   And Monica in Google plus, and Monica has done wonderful things with, because she's
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.240]   disabled and can't get around much.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.360]   So she's had photographers do hangouts with cameras through these Jerry rigged operations.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.320]   Now you can show anybody what you're seeing, right?
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   When you have to go off on a trip.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.120]   Yeah, Emma, here's where I am.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.920]   Here's where I am now.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.440]   Or if you're working on a car and you call a service bureau and say, here's what I'm
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   seeing.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   Is that normal?
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   That'd be kind of interesting.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440]   I can see a lot of uses for that.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.120]   Yeah, there's a video I think is one of Google's promotional videos.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.280]   A science teacher went to the, went to CERN and did a, did a hangout with his class showing
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.920]   him the, the, the collider.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.400]   Has the baby grabbed your glass?
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.560]   The baby has reached, has started to reach for glass and I've kind of, I've backed away.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.960]   She's still pretty little.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.200]   My kids stole my glasses for about four years.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.440]   So I'm just warning.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.240]   Um, surgeons.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.280]   So I'm about to, should I cut the left ventricle or the right vent?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   What do you think?
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   You're right.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   My right.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   Oh my God.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   Bob, Bob disposal is going to be used.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.800]   Bob disposal in a movie.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.040]   Oh, you'll see these in movies soon.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.880]   I would guess I've been driven absolutely berserk this last week.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.440]   Media have gone completely nuts trying to find everything that could possibly go wrong
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.240]   with class business insider wrote this ridiculous piece about, well, nobody likes class.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.160]   Um, that was the strangest piece ever.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.600]   I didn't, that was, but now they've got their, now they've got their own version.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.640]   Now Jay has got his, his, his, oh, now suddenly he likes it.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   So that coverage will change.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.000]   There is a petition on the white house stock of site, ban Google glass from use in the
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.800]   USA until clear limitations are placed to prevent indecent public surveillance.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.560]   I'm just happy to say that so far 30 signatures.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.800]   It's not exactly catching fire.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Geez.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.200]   Only 99,970 to go.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.560]   Um, yeah, I don't think glass is a big privacy.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.920]   After having played with it now, it's so obvious somebody's wearing it.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.520]   Uh, and, you know, and, and Robert said he, there, you know, he puts him on his head when
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.920]   he, you know, wants this signal that I'm going to treat this as private.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.320]   And I think that that will rapidly become kind of derigor, but you're not going to see
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   very many glad.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.440]   I mean, it's like, you know, you're not going to see him in the wild area.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.040]   I'm going to work with your contacts.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:56.640]   You know, fine, you know, it's not, I mean, you know, it's not virtual reality or anything.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.000]   It's a little screen right here.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.880]   It's not is your right eye, your nearsighted or far side.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   You want it.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.560]   I'm told Robert told me that in the training they told him you want it to be with the eye
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.120]   that you would look at a billboard with it.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.360]   It's in other words, your far vision, your far vision.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   Okay.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.040]   Uh, what about, have you seen anybody try to wear it with glasses, which is my, I have
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   seen pictures.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   I don't know.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   Robert says he's done it.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.280]   Although he got contacts, I guess, because he wanted to work last all the time.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   I don't know.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:35.600]   I just immediately became, I got an, you know, I wore it for a minute and I got it.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.440]   As I'm sure you feel too, Gina, you got it, right?
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   Mm hmm.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.520]   And I don't think you need to continue to wear it to get any more of it.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   Maybe you do.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.800]   Maybe you have to wear it all the time to really understand it.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.560]   It went, you know, when you start seeing your own data on it, you know, when you start to
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.600]   get your own text messages, when my mom calls me on glass and I just tap to say hi, you
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.040]   know, that there's something very personal kind of about that.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.600]   You realize like, oh, this is a really great communications device.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.880]   Like I'm not going to miss a call.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.680]   I know I can, I can, you know, I can just glance up to see a text message, which seems
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   very natural.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.880]   It feels really lazy to say that I'm just too lazy to pull out my phone and check, check
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   my text messages.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   But you know, sometimes I just miss them because, you know, I mean, look, this morning
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.520]   I was feeding the baby at both my hands and I took a video of her like eating mango for
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.200]   the first time, right?
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.800]   That's, and she made this really funny face and I got that video, which I wouldn't have
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.080]   been able to get because without glass, right?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   Because I wouldn't have been able to have the camera and also the spoon and all of this
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   stuff, right?
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.840]   So again, that seems like a really trivial usage.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   And I agree with you.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:38.080]   It kind of is, but it's meaningful to me because it's, it's very, very personal.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   So yeah, I think you can get it by seeing, you know, seeing the videos and trying on
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.880]   for a minute, but it, but then once you start, it starts to kind of get incorporated into
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.280]   your own life with your own data and your own sort of circumstances.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.640]   You start to see glimmers of, oh, this is, you know, this is interesting.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.440]   Now again, I'm not waking up in the morning reaching for glass.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.840]   Yeah, wait to get my glass on.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.680]   Yeah, no, I'm definitely not doing that.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.960]   But before I leave the house now, I'm like, oh, you know, I'll put, you know, put them
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   on a vasee something.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.040]   I'll take some pictures and definitely taking a lot more pictures and videos than I ever
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   did.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   And I think that's actually a good thing.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.200]   Did you see Tim Mariley was talking about the backlash?
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.160]   Yeah, but he also was, you know, Tim, I respect a lot.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.560]   I guess we mentioned this last week.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.560]   He was very impressed with glass.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.920]   Yeah, he's very pro glass.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.640]   And he, he said, this was just yesterday.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.520]   He said, what's really interesting to see is how, is to see how accepting people are
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.480]   public surveillance cameras while they're up in arms about cameras in the hands of individuals.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.000]   I'd rather have empowered individuals of cameras than laws, than laws that like corporations
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.840]   and government track us anytime with video while individuals have that right taken away.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.520]   So this is kind of, this is the point that this is the White House petition, right?
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.080]   This is the idea of like creep shots, right?
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.240]   I mean, you know, keen Andrew Keenan and Scoble, I just thought it was so funny that the first
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.480]   question about glass is like, you know, would you take a picture of my junk and the
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.640]   urinal, you know, which is like, really, like this is, I mean, I get it.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.800]   I guess we can go into that.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.880]   I didn't see a picture in the tumble blog.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.920]   There is a picture of a urinal and my caption is, don't look down.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.360]   Look at me farther down.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.000]   Right.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.360]   It's not like you're going to see this sudden, oh, we got to have glass up.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.160]   Well, I don't think.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.600]   I think the more people to see it, the more they have my reaction, which is, that's nice.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.480]   It's not a must have yet.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   Right.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.160]   But, but, you know, I'm waiting.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.480]   I think my problem with is the user interface.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.400]   I just really want it to be tapped right into my, my optic nerve.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.520]   Well, Leo, didn't you go to South by Southwest a couple of years ago and you had a giant
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.600]   backpack with the stick and the pack?
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.840]   I've done similar, similarly stupid things.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.240]   I mean, you wouldn't have to do that, right?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.480]   You're the live stream guy.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   You unlived your thing.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   I could do it.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   I just would let you do it.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   I kind of got past that too, by the way.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   I haven't done that before.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   You're over it.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.760]   I'm kind of over that as well.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.560]   That was your ugly George moment.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   Well, I was true.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   Yeah, ugly George.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   Remember him?
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.640]   Maybe if you're not from New York, you wouldn't remember him, but he had a cable channel.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.440]   He went around with a camera in New York.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.500]   We were trying different ways to the well, actually it's interesting because the point
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.520]   of that was to see what if I could give you a first person experience of South by like
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.760]   what it would be like to be at South by.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.480]   And we realized it doesn't work that well.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.080]   Although that crowd surfing video was pretty awesome.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.560]   Well, it was a cool moment.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.960]   It was a moment.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.400]   So you're a nerd and the chat room has asked a couple of times whether or not Glass has
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.080]   a web browser installed in it.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   And the answer is no.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.920]   I mean, the interface is those cards.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.440]   They look a lot like Google Now cards, except they have a dark background and white text
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   and you scroll through them horizontally versus vertically on your phone.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.680]   And so if you do a Google search, if you say, you know, Google, whatever, kittens, it will
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.520]   show you one result per card and you swipe through them on the touchpad this way.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.800]   So there isn't a traditional web browser.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   It wouldn't work.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.720]   You need, I mean, if you look at the text size on these things, you couldn't see a browser.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   You couldn't read anything.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   Right.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:15.160]   Which makes you add this to Siri, the idea of content pages.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   No way.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.560]   Because the text, I mean, you get, you really probably have what, Gina, 10, 15 characters
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.600]   across at all at most.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.280]   You can do different text sizes, but yeah, you really can't.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   You can't fit that much.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   So I think it's a little misleading.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.600]   They say it's like a 25 inch monitor five feet away from you.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.240]   It isn't.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   It isn't.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   You can't see that much.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   It's a tiny.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.920]   It sounds like, well, you're watching a lot too.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.080]   And you first had cell phones and you would get information.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.880]   And you remember how cell phones.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   The harm.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   We had to design everything.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   You were supposed to have cards.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   Literally.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   That's what we talked about.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   They have the mobile cards.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   And that wasn't a very satisfactory experience.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.800]   Wasn't it called WAT?
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   Right.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.720]   But I remember the few times I've used it and I've seen those little cards come up
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.360]   and it's almost like when you go to wanting to get that information, it's almost like
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.760]   you're not quite getting enough.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   Right.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   It's leaving you like one anymore.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:12.560]   That also makes you feel like as Gina said, it's going to get better that at some point,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.760]   just like our smartphones.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.160]   The idea that we would browse the web on the old phones that we had before, we had to get
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.880]   things like one little tiny screen at a time and so radically different that you can see
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.440]   it's going to get there.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   So maybe.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.920]   I mean, there's fairly insurmountable user interface issues the way it is.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.800]   I mean, to me, it's like it's a notification platform.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.080]   I mean, one of these cards, I've got six, seven lines down vertical and I don't know.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.000]   I haven't been able to count the number of characters across, but you're definitely limited
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   how much text you can show.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.960]   But you can think about it as like the Twitter of user interfaces, right?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.720]   Like Twitter, you can only do 140 characters.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.120]   You kind of think about think of it that way.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.440]   So like the New York Times app, it just shows you the headline.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.400]   And one of the things that you can do is you can say glass, read me the headlines.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.600]   It'll just read it to you in sort of a robotic voice, but you're not going to read an article
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   a New York Times article.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.000]   So I think you said something really important.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.960]   I think that that's the key.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.160]   People think it's, oh, it's a computer interface.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.920]   It's not, it's a notification platform, much like a Pebble watch would be.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   It's not more.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   Exactly.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.920]   Right.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   It's a watch.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   Hold your eye.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   Exactly.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   You're just always looking at it.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   That's the difference in that in a watch.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.160]   Yeah, but it's a, it's, it's a good thing in some sense, but it's going to have to change.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.360]   If, if it's designed, for example, for you to use it as a search interface, right?
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.480]   And tell me if I'm wrong, but if I recall, it's basically doing the, I'm getting lucky,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.680]   you know, I'm, I'm feeling lucky.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   Not getting lucky.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   There's a significant difference.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Right.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   Thank you.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.600]   But if you're getting lucky with glass, you might be in trouble.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   One of the ideal things you want.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.200]   Or you may be so handsome you can overcome glass.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   But one of the ideal things you want for it so that it's something beyond just being
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:03.960]   like a glorified globe GoPro with Wi-Fi and everything is that you would, you would be
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.720]   able to do a local search, right?
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.840]   You'd be able to find restaurants and have it scrolling through the restaurants and having
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.920]   you pick the right one that you want.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.560]   Not, okay, I picked one type of thing.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.800]   And I don't know that it's, you know, I mean, it's, it's obviously going to take time to
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.040]   get there, but that is the kind of expansion that you'd want that sort of device to do.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.000]   Because otherwise, if it just continued to be this extension of your cell phone and then
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   you're having to go, I'll just go back to my phone, then then it really is more this notification
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.240]   camera type of thing and not necessarily a search tool type of thing.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.720]   And it seems like they want it to be that they seems like they want this to grow into
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.160]   the device you would have not the supplement.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.920]   Oh, I don't really think so.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.040]   I don't think it's going to be the device.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   It's not going to replace.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.800]   What they wanted to be.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   I'm not.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   And I think it's going to grow.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   They Google or they users.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   Google.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   Really?
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   No.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.560]   What's Sergey Brin said, sir, he says, hey, this is nice because I feel emasculated when
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.120]   I have to go and use my phone.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.360]   That's him saying, I think this should be what we have.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.280]   I don't think that's him saying, and this is what it is now.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.320]   This is what it's going to be in a year from now.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.080]   But I think what he's saying is this idea of wearable technology is what our future ought
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.160]   to be.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:22.560]   Not that we've got this handheld thing, which is really just an extension of the desktop
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.800]   handheld things that we were carrying around.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.480]   So yeah, that would be kind of your evolution with it.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.920]   But I'm not saying you get there in a year.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.280]   I'm not saying you get there.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.080]   It doesn't really do years.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.480]   And I don't even know that it turns into being a glass type of thing that we have.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.600]   I mean, it may be that we've got different things.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.800]   Maybe we've got one of these flexible bands that goes around our wrist that you can take
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.720]   out and spread out.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.600]   You know, I want that battle star to go back to go thing that they had.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.960]   I think the cell phone is actually pretty perfect.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.760]   I disagree with Sergey that it's just it's just a mask relating to look down at it.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.840]   It's got a nice screen.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.400]   This is 1920 by 1080.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.000]   I can do everything I want.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's in my pocket.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.040]   It's not so very far from me.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.120]   You know, Louis C.K. does this great bit about how he went to his kids dance, right?
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.520]   And all the parents were standing there like this, right, right, taking a video, you know,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.240]   and like kind of not being present looking at looking at the world through this tiny
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   screen.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.680]   And this is one of the things that glass you never have to do this with glass, right?
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.960]   You just you either tap it or you just head mounted camera.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.640]   I can do that with a GoPro.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   I can do that.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.960]   I have another pair of glasses of the camera right here.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.320]   This is not this is not new.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   It's not even innovative.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.560]   But because it's all those other things because it lets you share because you can also community,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.160]   you know, because it because it lets you receive text messages and send text messages.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.640]   And actually I'm pretty sure that if you do Google search and you get results, you can
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.680]   scroll through them using.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   So it's not just I'm feeling lucky.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   It's not just one result.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   You can scroll through them.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.600]   So potentially something like the four square app could say, Hey, here's a recommendation
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.200]   to restaurants, you scroll through them and maybe and then you tap one and it launches
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   into nav.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Here's how to get there.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.360]   I mean, navigation is another thing.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.520]   I mean, my wife is constantly telling me stop looking down at your phone while you're
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   driving, right?
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.720]   Because I just I just never went and bought a, you know, a mount to put it up.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.120]   Now I know there are laws that say, you know, the glass guide said don't don't wear glass
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.720]   and don't use navigation while you're driving because there aren't laws for this yet.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.200]   We don't even know if you're going to be kind of allowed, even though it's a hands-free
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.000]   device, but walking navigation certainly or biking.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's so so yeah, you're right.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.480]   There's a head, there's head mounted cameras.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.440]   I guess there's whisk watches which show your text messages.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.120]   Glass just does kind of all those things and why.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.240]   The other thing is that in New York, it sounds like I'm defending and promoting.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.880]   I'm pretty ambivalent about glass.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.000]   I'm just trying to sort of make the case or what's interesting about it.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   And the problem with the cell phone too is you see this in New York all the time.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.880]   These days we need a on the sidewalks.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.680]   We need a slow lane for tourists and textures.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   Right.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.160]   People who are interacting as they're trying to walk and so on.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's because New Yorkers just have to move so fast all the time.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Yeah, we do.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   We got places to go, man.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.640]   I'm like, you, Otis land.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640]   I'm looking at the skyscrapers.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   My God, I didn't know building could be that thing.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.560]   Oh my.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.560]   And you're going, I'm sorry.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.360]   I've got to be somewhere.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   Got to go.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   Got to go.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.600]   Got things to do here.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.800]   Anyway, yeah, it's something here.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.680]   It's the beginning, but it's just a very, very early days and it's kind of unknown exactly
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   where you go from here.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.720]   And I think there are some significant issues with it.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.800]   There's no question about that.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   Sure.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   It's an early product.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   That's why the things like that business insider piece and all these other things.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   Just dismiss it.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   No.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   It's ridiculous.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.600]   The point is that the developers hands will see what happens with it.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.080]   It's a concept.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.160]   Ten thousand people will use it.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.960]   And this is how you get better.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.960]   Exactly.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.240]   This is how you get how you make something good.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.400]   As you let very, very wealthy people try it for a while.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.000]   The guy from business insider, I remind, I try to remind him, I don't think he knew
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.880]   this history because he was a young whippersnapper.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.640]   But the PC, the Apple PC, all that was absolutely worthless until Visicoc was admitted.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Right.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.200]   And then the practical use that changed the world, Visicop was the thing that made the
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.680]   PC really important.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.040]   So what's the killer app?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.360]   What's the killer app for Glass?
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   We haven't seen it yet.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   We don't know.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   It ain't a spreadsheet.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   I can tell you that.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   No.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   That's top publishing.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   No.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   Maybe it's chess.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   Chess.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   Queen to Queen.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.560]   I play chess on my smartphone all the time.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.520]   I've got games going on right now.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.880]   Beaten them too.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.600]   But we shall have more than one.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Porn.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   Porn.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.800]   No, I'm telling you that that screen is not for watching porn.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.080]   No, not for watching.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.680]   It's for making it.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.800]   I do think that within six months, we will see maybe less.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.120]   We'll see point of view porn from Glass.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.560]   Seen through Glass.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.120]   Hmm.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.960]   Maybe the frames have to get sexier before.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.760]   I was just trying to go to a sponsor.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   I really was.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.600]   We're going to have a buffer now between the sponsor and that.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.200]   The door Guinness factors have to ration down a whole lot more before people want to
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.240]   get busy with these things on.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.400]   I bet you there's somebody in San Fernando Valley right now.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.160]   Making something with Glass.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   Making something.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.360]   Making something.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.480]   The point is, though, you have cameras.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.360]   I mean, you have, I mean, I have a, I mean, there's plenty of ways to put this camera
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.640]   on your head.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.760]   There are ways to go with cameras, but I mean, they're not, they're not really that
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   convenient, right?
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.320]   I mean, and the look see which goes over your ear and is right here.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.240]   I haven't seen a GoPro porn.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.720]   Where's my, oh, I bet you there is GoPro porn.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   I don't know.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   I bet there is actually.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.240]   I, I, somewhere I have my spectacles with the glasses with, it's got an SD card in it.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   It's called Pivothead.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.120]   Dicty Bartolo does a lot of Pivothead videos.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.920]   That's what it's about.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   But you know what?
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.200]   That's what you may see, though, as you've seen people try to put together the Google
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.360]   Glass clones and, and, and, you know, put that stuff together.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.680]   But the, the smart people would actually say, you know what?
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.440]   Let's just put together something that is a Wi-Fi photo video device.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.840]   And it's as easy as taking pictures, tapping, or as easy as taking a picture is, you know,
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.440]   you do speak to it or whatever.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.600]   Maybe it doesn't have the Wi-Fi aspect to it or whatnot.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   But it shouldn't be that hard to build something like that for a couple hundred dollars if
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.680]   not less.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:54.840]   And that might give a bunch of people, you know, like 75% of the usage that the, that,
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.160]   that Google Glass is already getting.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.080]   But then it would be interesting to see if you see these kinds of clones and these sort
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.800]   of knockoffs that these developments come into that.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.920]   If it even further shapes or this acceptability that we're all walking around with cameras
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.720]   and recording our, our, our lives as we go around.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.320]   For some reason, I just feel like that will be resolved.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   There'll be some sort of netiquette established for Glass.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.520]   So yes, make it feel better.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.360]   I don't, I'm not too worried about that.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:25.000]   So now two out of the three hosts of all about Android will be wearing Glass during the program.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.480]   And so is Jason going to pick his up or is he going to get your Jason?
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.280]   Do you have you made an appointment yet?
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.760]   No, I'm going to actually buy it before it's made.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.240]   Well, let me give you a credit card.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.680]   And then we should, you should go down there with a camera crew and because you should
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   go down, right?
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   You're not going to have a mail up.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   Yeah, go to Mountain View.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.560]   All right, I'll give you a credit.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.880]   My wallet's in the desk drawer there, Jeff.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.960]   If you get them and you can't see anything because you got the problem with the glasses
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.320]   or contacts or whatever, can you?
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   You can give them the lead.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   You can cancel the transaction.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   You don't wear glasses.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   Do you, Jared?
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   Yes.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   You do.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   But you're wearing contacts.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   Okay.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   It's only on the right eye.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   They don't have left diversions.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   You just did.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   You can return them.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   I think it's 30 day return policy.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   Oh, let's go.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.120]   And when you go down, I went to go pick them up.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.040]   If you go down and pick them up, there's a glass guide who will sit down with you and
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   fit them and do the nose pads and show you how to use it.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.840]   And so you'll sort it out pretty quickly, like right on the spot, whether or not you
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.920]   can use them.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   I think this is kind of cool.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.720]   Here, give this to Jason and you can charge it.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.400]   Now by the way, I've just invented a new wallet that has, look at this.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   This is awesome.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   A chess set built in.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.840]   I don't need to carry a smartphone anymore.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:38.440]   I've got my, we're going to take a break and come back in just a moment.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.920]   Gina Trappatti, daddy Sullivan, Jeffrey Jarvis, the picture's still holding up.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   Still looks good.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   Google, man.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   Google.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   Google.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   Who knew?
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.280]   It'd be pretty good products I heard.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   I tell you.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.760]   Listen, I got this thing on my face.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.360]   So I must think so.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.360]   You are Google down.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   Dark.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360]   Dark.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   Dark.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   Dark.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.880]   At least you're not calling me the other name.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.480]   What other name?
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   Glasshead.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.240]   Oh, Glasshead.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.320]   Oh, man.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.360]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.440]   It is not a law firm.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.040]   No better than a law firm, LegalZoom.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.920]   Let's you do legal work through their self-help services.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.120]   You direct it.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.920]   You fill out a questionnaire and suddenly you've got a will.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   You've got a trust.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   You've got an LLC or a corporation.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.560]   You got your trademark, your patent, your NDA.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.840]   There's so much legal work you can do without a lawyer.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.240]   Just common sense.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   You've always known that.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.760]   Why spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars?
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.520]   Just to form an LLC when you could do it at LegalZoom for $99.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.760]   If you say, "Well, $99, I can't do that."
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.640]   That's how Twits LLC was formed and still it's eight years later, still good.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.740]   Still works.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.620]   We have our own legal team now and it's still LegalZoom.com.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   Does it all?
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.300]   Well, not all, but they did that.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   They do.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.660]   In fact, what they've got now that they didn't have before is this legal plan.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.820]   These legal plan attorneys, which are fantastic, it means you can get advice from an experienced
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.180]   attorney in your state for a fixed rate.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.500]   That's awesome.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.500]   They have profiles of the attorneys on the legal plan, including an unedited customer
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.340]   review so you can pick the attorney you think is going to be the best for what you need.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.940]   Then it's very simple to fill out the questionnaire and go through.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.780]   If you don't have a will, the courts will decide where your kids go, where your assets
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.100]   go, if something should happen to you.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.260]   You really want a will.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.260]   Living trusts.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.980]   Wills are just $69.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.140]   Copyrights, patents, trademarks.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.180]   Trademark is something maybe you should consider for a lot of our audience.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.060]   You probably have a blog name or a brand or something.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.300]   You may say, "Well, it's not a business, but it's inexpensive and easy to trademark
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   it."
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   Well worth doing.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.780]   LegalZoom.com.

[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:12.140]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.780]   Google hires a chief game designer.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.780]   What could that all mean?
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.180]   Noah Follstein.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:30.300]   Is Google getting serious about gaming asks tech crunch?
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.700]   What would this be for?
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.260]   I mean, there are games on Google+, but they're third party games.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.260]   Aren't they?
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.780]   Does Google own any of those?
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.260]   Is it for ingress?
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.260]   Good question.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.260]   They had a game before this.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.260]   They acquired an entire game company.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   They did.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.260]   They did.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   At one point.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   I'll look it up somewhere.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.660]   But yeah, no, they had a whole-- they were doing a whole-- it was even before ingress.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.660]   They--
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.060]   His ingress was my head deck.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.220]   They hired some game company, then they got rid of the game company.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:10.540]   So Follstein worked at LucasArts, 3DO, DreamWorks Interactive.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:14.620]   He's now-- his title is "Chief Game Designer at Google."
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.620]   He joined him last month.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.620]   It was just investments that they did.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.300]   An Iantic, which they own, makes ingress.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:28.020]   And ingress makes a lot of sense in the Glass universe, because it's a game you play with
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.340]   your smartphone as you move around.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.660]   It's basically an augmented reality game, basically.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.660]   Lively.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   What is it?
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.660]   Lively?
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   Lively.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.660]   Lively.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.660]   Do you not remember?
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660]   It was lively.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.660]   They launched it in Google Labs.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.140]   It was to allow people to interact with their friends and express themselves online.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.660]   They closed it in 2008.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.580]   I think if I'm Google, I think about Gamif-- the Gamific--
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.620]   the gamification of things that are going to help me like-- that's why ingress is good,
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.420]   because it maps the world, right?
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:03.500]   So the gamification of something that-- I don't know if what?
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   Gamification.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.580]   I say gamification, because I like to think of long, slender games.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.580]   No.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.020]   It's just how it should be pronounced.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   Look at this.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.780]   Advanced game development topics on Google I/O.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.740]   Level up your Android game.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.900]   Practical Android games.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   There's a whole game--
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.660]   But the game stuff makes sense, because-- I mean, for all the talk about people who like,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:29.700]   well, Google Play has this many thousands of apps in iOS, has this many millions of
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.100]   apps, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   When you go back through and you actually look at what the top apps are, they're games.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.900]   A lot of them are stupid games, too, but they're games.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.220]   But I mean, I don't think Google's in the interest-- it has any interest in making a successful
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   app, unless it's forwards their goal as--
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.100]   It has-- it's just having successful games.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:56.500]   So I had my two kids did this test where I gave them Windows phones for a month, right?
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   That they shifted off the iPhone.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.300]   You're such a mean dad.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.300]   Oh, my--
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   They asked for it.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.580]   They voluntarily said, do you have this phone we saw on the commercial?
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.620]   And I said, yeah, I've got that.
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.500]   And so Microsoft-- I said to Microsoft, hey, you want to try this thing?
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.740]   Send down two phones, and I'll switch them out, and we'll see how they go with it.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.940]   My oldest son gave up, like, within a day, because it was no Instagram.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.940]   He was done, right?
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.940]   No Instagram.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.580]   I do not need to use this phone.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.620]   I need to use the iPhone or Android.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.940]   My youngest son has stuck with it.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.780]   He loves-- loves the Windows phone with one exception that occasionally he's going back
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   to the iPhone just-- this one particular game with his brother, because it's only on
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:36.780]   the iPhone.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:42.700]   And I think that Google has a huge interest in having popular games that are as good on
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:48.460]   Android as they are on the iPhone, or that only are available on Android, because that
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.620]   can propel people to say, I want to get that device.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:55.060]   So maybe Fosteid is not going to be a developer, although his title is "Chief Game Designer."
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.820]   Maybe he's a developer relations kind of a guy.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.820]   No, we--
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.820]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.820]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:07.140]   I was going to say maybe he does something similar, like with what Microsoft did with
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:12.140]   Halo, because if I recall the whole history of Halo, it wasn't-- wasn't a Microsoft
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.860]   studio product, or just something that Microsoft worked very closely with--
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.180]   That was Bungie, and they bought Bungie.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.300]   But it helped make the Xbox, you know, that thing.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.820]   And it may be that, you know, Google's at this point where they're like, we need to
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:30.380]   have a flagship game in the way that we have flagship Nexus devices, because unless we
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:34.660]   set standards to a certain degree, then maybe the other people won't go up to their understand
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.100]   the kinds of things that they can do.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.580]   Or here's another way to look at it.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.980]   Maybe-- and I'm not a gamer, so I don't know.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.820]   But is there a chance that Google, being a platform company, could create a platform
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.820]   for good game creation?
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.540]   Yeah, I mean, I think this is what they're trying to do.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.940]   So we covered this on all about Android.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.460]   A couple of episodes back, actually Android police, they do these APK tear downs, where
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.660]   they take the APK, which is an Android app, and then unzip it, and basically look at
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.460]   the insides and see if there's any more information about things that Google is doing.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:10.660]   And interestingly, in the My Glass companion app, there was all this code that appeared
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.300]   to be related to games around Play Services.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:20.300]   So Play Services-- it looked as if Play Services was getting real time and turn-based multiplayer
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.820]   invitation, in-game chat, lobbies, leaderboards, achievements.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.740]   So to me, it sounds as if-- and I think this is going to happen in I/O next week-- Google
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:34.980]   is going to announce a game center, where they want developers to be using Google+
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.780]   sign-in to have player sign-in, because Danny's right on the nose.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.740]   Like games are the biggest revenue generators on the list.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:42.940]   Oh, you're on it, Jeanette.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.580]   Google+ and games, right?
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.260]   Yeah, Google+ and games, exactly.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   Well, they already have a game section on Google+.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.260]   Yeah, but no, no.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.660]   You want to involve-- you want to make Google+ a game for some people.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.660]   That's what--
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.660]   Exactly.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.660]   --and it's involved in the game--
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.660]   The gamification of Google+.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.660]   Yes.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.660]   Right.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.980]   There's a game section in Google+, I don't think it did as well.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.580]   I think that this is going to be Android-based, but remember last week we covered the story
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:11.780]   where developers that enable Google+ sign-in and their apps that Google aggregate stats.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.100]   So if you search for Fandango in Google search results, it'll say Google+ users like this
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.740]   movie the most.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.740]   So Google wants this integration.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.500]   So they're going to be pushing that Google+ sign-in next week at I/O.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.260]   And I also think that they're going to make a big game-related announcement.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.860]   I think this is going to be about-- I don't know if it's about the Uya, but I think it's
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.100]   going to be about-- part of it is going to be about the Uya.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.060]   I think part of it is that they know that games is game sell the best.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:37.420]   And I think they want to make that platform for developers to make awesome games on Android
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.740]   that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.180]   And I think they're going to use that integration across all their products that they now can
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.740]   provide with the quality of privacy policy.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.780]   This is all sort of building blocks on top of that.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.620]   I think that's where they're going to go.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.620]   I think this-- I think games is going to be a big part of the keynote next week.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   I like the idea that it might be tied somehow to augmented reality in Glass.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:04.900]   I'd love to see Glass-specific games that I have to do with interacting with your environment.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.660]   And what Google gets out of it is more information about what's going on.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.860]   Maybe you're the next Google Street View.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.700]   Ingress or field trip on Glass would be awesome.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   Makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   And LAR.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.700]   Do you know LAR?
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   L.A.Y?
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.700]   That's an augmented reality browser.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.460]   augmented reality program on an afternoon.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.500]   So really seriously, they can get rid of their whole Street View fleet.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.820]   If they get enough people out there wearing Glass.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.060]   Yeah, an image will be more up to date, right?
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.860]   If you have an all-new folks taking-- I mean, you listen, Glass isn't on unless you have
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.860]   it on, right?
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.020]   And you're actually taking pictures.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:45.660]   But I mean, I take two to three times more pictures with Glass because it's so easy that
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.660]   I take with my smartphone.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.820]   And I felt like I took a lot of my smartphone.
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.820]   More data.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.820]   More data.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.820]   Just more data.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.820]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.220]   I don't think it's wrong to interpret Google hiring a gaming guy.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.100]   Not as a way to get into games or develop more games, but as a way to create games that
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.260]   support Google's real mission, which is gathering data.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.260]   Yes.
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.220]   That's why I think they could game-- I mean, look at Four Squares, a really good example
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.380]   of it's almost a game.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.580]   Well, not anymore.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.020]   They wish they hadn't done that.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   Really?
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   They wish they hadn't done it?
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.020]   Badges.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.020]   Yeah, they don't want badges.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.620]   They want to be the location layer of the web.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.020]   But they got all that information because of badges.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.020]   Where they start.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.660]   But yeah.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.740]   But now they recognize that it's not the thing and they're known just for that.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.980]   But if I don't get badges, why should I check in?
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.980]   Because you get great information.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:41.380]   Because you're going to be told really interesting tips that Danny went here last week and he
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.500]   loved the peanut butter cupcake.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.500]   That's what they want to do.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.180]   Do you guys get great tips from Four Square when you check in?
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.180]   It is awesome.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.060]   Because we're in Petaluma.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:52.980]   All the tips are mine.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.980]   It's from two years ago.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.980]   It depends on where you're at.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.540]   But I use it all the time.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.700]   I always joke that it's almost like my personal tricorder.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.700]   I turn it on.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.220]   I use that as an example of demonstrating why a search isn't just I type something into
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.780]   a box that's typically a box owned by Google.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:16.980]   If I get to an airport or I get to a city and I'm looking for a place to eat, I can turn
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.980]   it on.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.780]   It knows where I'm at and it's showing me things that are nearby.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.100]   And I haven't even done a search.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.100]   Right?
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.820]   It's very similar to Google now.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   That's for sight.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.420]   They're kissing you right now because that's exactly what they want to be known for.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.620]   And they're great.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.700]   If you're in a place where people have been sharing stuff and there have been times where
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:39.020]   I felt like people have actually shared more in some places than they have on, say, Yelp.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:43.260]   In other cases, they aren't good or whatever.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:49.780]   I think the challenge they have right now is they need to probably get bundled in with
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:57.260]   the Facebook or Google because I feel like Google and Facebook are now pushing their
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:03.140]   own local app so much that it's maybe more easy for people to contribute to those things
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   than Four Square.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.420]   And it's hard for me to get a sense on how much Four Square is getting beyond the group
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.580]   of people who started because of the badge thing and then have discovered it in other
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.580]   ways.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.580]   You know what's interesting is in the--
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.220]   It's a really useful tool.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.540]   In the new Four Square, they kind of buried it.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.900]   But in the settings, connected credit cards and savings, they're encouraging you to enter
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.780]   your credit cards into Four Square.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.900]   Well, in fact, we talked about this a year ago.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.940]   Five bucks from Amex every time I buy.
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:30.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:34.820]   So if you've connected in credit cards, then you get exclusive savings with Four Square
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.820]   specials.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.940]   But isn't that really what everybody wants?
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.100]   That's what Apple has.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.540]   That's what Google Wallet has.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.420]   They got a credit card and it's one click to buy stuff.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.740]   Now they have a huge leg up Amazon.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.180]   It makes sense that Four Square would want you to do that.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.180]   They don't really promote it.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.180]   I found it.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.180]   It's buried.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   That's true.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.340]   Well, that's kind of a marketing deal with them.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.940]   But Four Square, again, the location layer of the net.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.100]   And it's a social layer that's going to give you better recommendations than a mere search
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.100]   engine.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.100]   Right.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:11.260]   But to give you a sense like Four Square on-- I'm looking at iTunes charts.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.500]   It is not in the top 100.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.500]   Right.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   You know?
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.500]   It's pretty geeky.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.860]   And in contrast, you know, things like Tumblr or something like that are showing up in there.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.180]   Even something like Pinterest is there.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:31.100]   So that kind of-- are you breaking through to the broader stuff that you need to get
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.100]   to?
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.100]   I don't know if they're there.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.100]   And I think that's what I need to get to.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:38.740]   Because they've got great data and they've got smart people who understand local.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.980]   Really, really understand it well.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:44.260]   And my interview is that they've started on the coasts and then they hope to, as other
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.540]   apps, do migrate into the heartland.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.940]   Eric Schmidt goes off the reservation again talking at NYU Stern Business School.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.220]   He does it every time about Google.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:58.900]   And he says, "People should have a delete button for the internet."
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.140]   Isn't this what Google's fighting in Europe?
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   The right to--
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   Even really.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   --differently.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.900]   You know, I'm reading his book right now.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:12.940]   It's confusing because on the one hand in his book, he's saying like, "Well, you know,
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.500]   once it goes out on the internet, it's not on the internet and you're never going to
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.820]   get rid of it.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.620]   And there's just nothing you can do about it."
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.140]   And then it's like, "But then we ought to have a delete button."
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:26.820]   And it's like, "Well, I can't even go to your own search engine and use a delete button."
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   Because if I were to say to you, "Oh my gosh, there's something really embarrassing even
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:30.820]   it's just a suggestion."
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.300]   And you're like, "Well, can't do anything about that because that's just what the people
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.300]   are saying."
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:40.620]   I don't-- he says that sometimes I feel like he just says these things just to like get
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.620]   people going.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.620]   But--
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.260]   Well, no, I think he's more than that.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.900]   It's really interesting in his book.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:53.380]   He almost seems paranoid that kids somehow don't have the ability to have any judgment
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.540]   until they become adults about what they do.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:00.020]   Or that until the age of the internet, people never did embarrassing things that could perhaps
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.020]   haunt them.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:06.300]   It's really very strong like, "Well, you have kids who don't have these social skills who
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.540]   don't know what they're going to be doing.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.060]   We need to kind of protect them or whatever."
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:16.500]   And I kind of feel like I think in 20, 30 years what you did on the internet when you
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.380]   were 18 is going to be like Bill Clinton saying, "Yeah, I never inhaled."
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.300]   And then Obama saying, "Yeah, I inhaled."
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.700]   It's like those norms start to change.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.140]   And when everybody has their party pictures up when they were drunk because they were
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.060]   14 or whatever and they shouldn't have been doing it, I'm not saying that you should
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   do this.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.660]   And boys, don't do that.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:36.660]   Well, we know that--
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:41.460]   But if everybody's done that, then you're no longer embarrassed because everybody's done
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.460]   it.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:46.940]   I think it's accepted psychological theory that adolescents take risks because it's
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.620]   safer to take risk as an adolescent.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:54.420]   So from an evolutionary point of view, we're kind of programmed to take risks at a younger
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.660]   age so we can learn.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.220]   So it's normal to make mistakes as a teenager.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:03.020]   Schmidt said, "In America, there's a sense of fairness culturally true for all of us.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:07.140]   If you have a teenage boy or girl who makes a mistake, does some sort of crime, goes to
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.460]   juvenile hall, is released in our system they can apply and have that expunged from
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.460]   their record.
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.620]   They can legally state they were never convicted of anything."
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.460]   That seems like a reasonable thing.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.860]   This is really of a crime.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.660]   No, that's too deep.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.460]   Okay, but today that's not possible because of the internet that seems to violate our innate
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.460]   sense of fairness.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.020]   This is the quote.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:32.220]   This lack of a delete button on the internet is in fact a significant issue.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:37.140]   There are times when a ratio is the right thing and there are times when it's inappropriate.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.300]   How do we decide we have to have that debate now?
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.620]   This is driving me crazy in First Amendment land.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:49.100]   And I was on a panel a few weeks ago here at CUNY with Bill Keller of the New York Times
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.100]   was on the same panel.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.780]   And he wrote a column about this afterwards.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:56.180]   And it sounds reasonable to say that, but what's happened in fact is in some cases,
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.140]   newspapers are being told to erase things from their archives.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.060]   That is a First Amendment issue.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.260]   That's a free speech issue.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.860]   That's only a First Amendment issue if a government tells them to delete stuff.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   It's not a First Amendment issue.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:12.020]   Well, as you say, yeah, there's a law that says that when this is off the record, the
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.340]   record is out of the record.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.500]   And then the other problem is let's say the newspaper says, "Well, you know, Danny Sullivan
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.620]   was arrested when he was 15 for blank."
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.380]   And Danny says, "No, no, that got expunged."
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.060]   But the newspaper says, "Well, no, but it was still a fact."
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.060]   It's still true.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.060]   It's happened.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.380]   Well, but now you have no proof of that because now the record has been expunged.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.100]   We can't—this is what drives me crazy about this.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.220]   I'm offended by the notion that you can control knowledge, that you can control facts.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   You can't.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.660]   Dana Boyd taught me this lesson.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.460]   You can control the use of knowledge.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.980]   But if we think you control knowledge, where does that end, Chairman Mao?
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.700]   By the way, Gina Caesar has just announced we will not allow people to wear glass while
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.700]   gambling or attending our shows.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.700]   Oh, damn.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.340]   You'll see that everywhere in Vegas.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   There goes this weekend.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340]   Hey.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.020]   You know, okay, so there's a little more attention probably on this delete button thing.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:09.380]   But I actually liked what Eric Schmidt said, and it's probably worth repeating in another
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.860]   context.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:20.060]   The moderator, Norelle Rabini, was apparently kind of grilling Schmidt about Google tracking
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060]   people.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.140]   And this is what Schmidt said, and I think this is important to hear.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.140]   Let me be very clear.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   Google is not tracking you.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.140]   It's not doing all these things.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.940]   Which is totally alive because it is.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.820]   Does everyone get that we're not doing this?
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   Apparently, Danny doesn't.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.980]   He's talking about a different company or set of companies.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.980]   I think you're describing a world of tracking which I think is highly unlikely to occur
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.620]   because people will be upset about it in the same way that you are.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.260]   Governments won't allow it, and it'll be bad business.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:52.500]   And ultimately, in a competitive market, companies want the consumer to be happy.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.500]   So it's true.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.260]   Tracking in this context, a situation where you go to people and say, "Oh, here's our
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.380]   phone and we're going to track you."
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.660]   People are not going to buy that phone.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.660]   It's a bad business model.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.980]   So, Danny, you disagree?
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.380]   You think Google is tracking you?
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.060]   Of course, they're tracking you.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.740]   Every time I use Google now, it tracks me.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.180]   I have this thing on Google Maps.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.540]   There's a button that I'm looking at it right now.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.220]   It's called My Places.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.780]   And when I click on it, it is quite literally tracking you.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.780]   Let's see where I've been.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.380]   This is actually quite literally tracking your image.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.380]   But you opted into that.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.660]   I was at Google headquarters on basics, so Google knows that.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.060]   But you opted into that, Danny.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.060]   You turned that on.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.060]   That's it.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060]   That's it.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.060]   I know me.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.060]   It's still tracking me.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.060]   It's still tracking me.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.060]   It's still tracking me.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   That's what the meaning of track is.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060]   Is it…
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:37.700]   Robini was saying basically he was trying to list all these ways and evidently, Smith
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700]   kept on trying to interrupt him.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700]   Right, right.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.940]   If he's saying all these ways in which you're being involuntarily tracked.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   No.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.020]   I don't think Google's involuntarily tracking people.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.020]   No, I wouldn't agree with that.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.020]   Google is not surveilling you.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.020]   Even if they know where you've been, they're not…
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.260]   There's no human going.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.100]   Let's see where Danny's been.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.100]   There's no surveillance.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.100]   That makes it a different thing.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.300]   Google has a record of all the places you've been to when you turn on your phone.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.940]   I guess the government can.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.940]   So does my…
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.940]   Hey, I'm so…
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:05.940]   It's been a little difficult.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.900]   I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.380]   My Google now is better because it happens.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.980]   But yeah, Google has a pretty good idea of the places I've been to.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980]   So does Apple.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980]   So does AT&T.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.620]   So does Verizon.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.020]   So does any number of people who have access to my phone.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.020]   So everybody's tracking.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.940]   Our location gets shared all over the place.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.380]   So Eric to say, "Well, we don't track you."
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:32.140]   He's like, "Yeah, you do track people in lots of ways.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.820]   Do you track people voluntarily when they allow you to do it?"
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.500]   Sure, in lots of ways.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.740]   Do you track people in some ways that they probably aren't aware of when they're all
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.740]   over the web?
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740]   Absolutely.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.420]   You'll find out anonymous cookies to people that they don't often know that they have.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.660]   And you can see them through their ad network and you can see them virtually where they're
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.660]   going to be going.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.100]   You've got all sorts of applications that are on your own phones that turn on that may
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.380]   tell people they're sharing stuff.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.340]   But they don't really think about it that much.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.980]   That's more down to the people than down to Google.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.780]   But yeah, there's a lot of tracking going.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.500]   Yes, of a very good point, Danny.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.580]   So is Eric lying or does he…
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.500]   Well, I didn't hear the whole interview.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.780]   So that's why I was saying if it's…
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780]   Does Google track people?
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.700]   Yes, of course it tracks people.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.300]   Does Google track people in some evil nefarious way?
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.900]   I've got your stuff.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   Mostly no.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.740]   But he said they're not tracking the art track.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   Of course they're tracking.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]   I don't know.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   They're collecting data.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.420]   He was trying to respond to Rubini.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:30.540]   Rubini was trying to paint a picture of a horrible evil surveilling monster.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.540]   And Eric's reacting to that.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.540]   And let's be honest.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.460]   We all hear this all the time.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.660]   And so I would kind of say the same thing.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.660]   Yeah, it is.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.660]   It's Bill Clinton time.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   Define is.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.660]   But I would use the verb surveilling.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.660]   Tracking, yeah.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.660]   Cookies track you.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.660]   Okay, fine.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.660]   They're tracked.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.660]   Yes.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.660]   But tracking is taken on an evil, uh-oh word.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:00.660]   And what I think Rubini was really trying to get to, what was really trying to answer is,
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.660]   is Google surveilling you.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:06.660]   Is it tracking you for a purpose that is against your will and without your knowledge?
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:10.820]   No, now meanwhile, by the way, the government is trying to get Google to do that.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:15.140]   The government is trying to get Google to put back doors into chats in ways that you
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.300]   will not be aware of.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.540]   And Google was trying to do it with SISPA.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.420]   Google was kind of supporting that effort.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:24.860]   They were trying to at least establish kind of parameters around that.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860]   Well let's take a break.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.860]   You need some instruction.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.980]   Let's take a break because Mike Elgin wants to defend Jeff's wrongheaded support of the
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.140]   Google Pixel.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.860]   And we'll give him his day and court in just a moment.

[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   Choose your template.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.140]   They have beautiful templates.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.460]   And these are just starting points.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.020]   I don't want you to think this is what your site's going to look like.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.420]   This is just where you begin.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.620]   And then you customize your site to make it incredible.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.660]   They've got a new template.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:31.660]   Let me see if I can find it, a full bleed template that is just gorgeous.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.540]   What is it called?
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.540]   Momentum, right?
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.460]   See, I can find it here in this.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:42.540]   Just the, these are all mobile responsive, which means once you start using, maybe this
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:49.980]   is momentum now, once you start using this template, it will look good on any size page.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   There it is.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.980]   It's the doggy.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.540]   Click the doggy.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.980]   So momenta, oh, you don't see my pick.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.220]   You don't see my screen, do you?
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.380]   There it is.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.380]   So that's a full bleed.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.180]   In other words, it is so image, beautiful image.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.100]   And on a big screen, it fills the screen on a small screen.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.100]   It fills the screen.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.100]   It looks great.
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.580]   The best mobile experience.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:14.300]   They've got a new feature called events collection, which allows you to share schedule updates,
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:19.700]   like store, sale events, band, tour of dates very easily.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.940]   Just really there is, that's beautiful, isn't it?
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.820]   Now, the point is you're going to get started with momentum, but you're going to make it
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.940]   look like your own unique site.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.420]   And that's what I want you to do right now.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.340]   Visit squarespace.com.

[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.660]   But let me just show you quickly the pricing because you're going to be blown away.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.460]   I mentioned the unlimited plan.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:48.340]   That's $16 a month when you buy an annual plan, or you can go month to month for $20
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   a month.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.580]   Add a few bucks more, $24 a month.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.860]   You've got e-commerce on top of that.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.420]   And they don't take a cut of what you sell.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.540]   You can sell unlimited physical products, unlimited digital products.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.100]   You get a mobile store inventory tracking.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.460]   They'll calculate taxes for you.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.140]   They'll handle shipping and coupon controls.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.180]   So I mean, this makes it as easy.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:11.340]   You're going to create an amazing commerce site.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.740]   Looks like you've been doing this your whole life in minutes.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.100]   And then of course, you also get the unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage,
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.500]   all of that custom domain name when you sign up for a year plan.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.180]   They'll register your domain name and hook it up to the site.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:31.180]   Of course, Squarespace has always got great support for you with the help.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.500]   And they have workshops and a great active forum too.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.700]   I want you to try Squarespace.

[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:43.660]   If after two weeks, and import all your content, by the way, and then after two weeks you feel
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:49.100]   like, hey, I might want to try this out, use the offer code TWIG5, TWIG in the number
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:54.420]   five, and you'll take 10% off your first purchase on new accounts, monthly or annual plans.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   But you're going to want to do the annual plan to save the most.

[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.300]   We're talking about Google in the cloud with Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.300]   York.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.820]   I like that.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.820]   You narc.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:12.820]   You narc.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.820]   You narc.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:19.020]   Danny Sullivan is also with us from Search Engine Land and Marketing Engine Land.
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:23.260]   Danny's always good to have Danny on because he sees through it.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.420]   He's seen it all.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.420]   He's been there.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.980]   He's not going to take any guts.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.780]   I like grumpy.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:34.740]   And then the happy-go-lucky Gina Trapani wearing her Google Glass.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.860]   Gina the Borg.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:40.780]   I had my first, I touched the pixel for the first time this weekend when I went up to
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.100]   Google LA to pick up glass.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.300]   So they had a pixel there to check people in.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.700]   And I said, "Oh, can I just try something?"
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.460]   And the woman was like, "Sure."
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.860]   And then of course, the first thing I did was go to the Verge.com.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.500]   Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.700]   Did you go fullscreen?
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.700]   Yeah, I did.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.220]   And I started and I got to tell you Leo.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   Smooth as butter.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.220]   He's smooth to me.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.620]   Yeah, but he's smooth to me.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.620]   And she was kind of looking at me and I was like, "That's all."
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620]   Never mind.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620]   That's all I wanted to do.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.620]   Whatever.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.620]   That's cool.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.620]   So thank you.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.820]   She's my glass guide.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:19.260]   I took, when I went up to Google on Monday, I took the pixel out for the first time on
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.260]   a road trip.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:25.500]   I was really nervous about it because normally it's like MacBook Air and I want to have all
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   my stuff.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500]   And it was great.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.420]   I didn't have any problems with it.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.820]   The battery was not just fine and I was able to connect to my phone, had some problems
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   with it.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   The Wii against one.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.340]   And four may include Mike Elgin now.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.500]   He got his pixel.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   He's using it.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   He says, "Everything you've heard..."
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.940]   He's like you.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.540]   He's trying to go entirely.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.420]   Everything you've heard about the pixel is wrong.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.260]   Myth one, the pixel's overpriced.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:54.300]   I don't know how you could say that's a myth, but okay, fine, whatever.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.860]   He says, "Compared to what?"
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.260]   Compared to everything else.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:02.020]   Let's see, that's the first page.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.260]   Basically, you can't get a screen that good.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.380]   And application files are on the cloud, not true.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.460]   In fact, more and more you're seeing apps that keep it on the touch screen is awkward
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.740]   and pointless.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.740]   He says, "That's a myth.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:18.780]   Pixel's well-designed and engineered is as well-designed and engineered as an Apple product."
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.220]   He says...
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   Not quite.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   He says...
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.540]   Not quite, but it is better than any Windows product.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.540]   Yes.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.700]   The pixel's inconvenient.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.060]   He says, "It's not as inconvenient as you might think."
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.660]   Now this is a myth that he says, "There's no market for the pixel.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.260]   I don't think anybody's demonstrated a market for the pixel."
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.100]   I actually agree with you on that, Leo.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.740]   I don't think the point of the pixel is a market.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740]   Well, all right.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.740]   So I'm just wrong.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.740]   I'll admit it.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.100]   So things you don't want people to say about your glasses, they're not too that bad.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.100]   They're not that bad.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.020]   And there's things you don't want people to say about your laptop.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   It's not that inconvenient.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.020]   It's not that inconvenient.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.020]   It's okay.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.020]   I mean, it's still...
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:05.460]   It's still better off spending the money on a retina.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:12.500]   You'd have a far more functioning machine for a similar price, perhaps a little less.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.100]   You would have a far more flexible machine.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.900]   And the retina also has one looking at cross.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.380]   It's not that big a difference.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.340]   Oh, it's slightly better than the retina, whatever.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:27.140]   The touchscreen is not anywhere near as good as, say, using the touchscreen of Windows,
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.020]   where you can actually touch the screen, pinch, zoom, do that sort of stuff.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.420]   I've used it a couple times.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:37.580]   It's not as compelling as it is with Windows, which was actually built and designed to have
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.020]   some touchscreen stuff.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.580]   Unfortunately, it's got all that other Windows stuff that kind of comes with it.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:49.260]   So it's nice, but honestly, you'd probably be fine with just a Chromebook without having
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.700]   to spend the premium on a Pixel.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.660]   I think, and I've said this before, they really should do a $500 or $600 Chromebook.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.820]   It's not as crappy as the netbooks that they're selling, but not as high-end as the Pixel.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.820]   Something in between.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   These cases is coming out with one.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.820]   That was on the one that Asus has come out with.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:05.820]   Well, we don't know what it's going to be yet, but you're going to see that, I think.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:13.980]   Department of Justice says we don't need warrants to spy on your email to read your Facebook
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.980]   posts.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.260]   And this is what you want to get mad about, not Google Glass.
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:22.020]   I am much matter about this, believe me.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:27.860]   Government documents attained by the ACLU, and then they gave it to CNET say that there
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.780]   is a little bit of a split within the Obama administration, Justice Department of Prosecutor
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:37.100]   leaders, investigators privately insist they're not legally required to obtain search warrants
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.780]   for email.
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.820]   The IRS said last month it will abandon the controversial policy that says we don't need
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:47.540]   a warrant.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.340]   So apparently they're just going and asking.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.340]   They don't need a warrant.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:54.980]   Although, I think Google and others say no if you don't have a warrant, right?
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:14:00.700]   Obama may back an FBI plan in related news to wiretap web users.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.780]   The Obama administration resolving years of internal debate, according to the New York
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:10.260]   Times, is on the verge of backing a FBI plan for sweeping overhaul of surveillance laws
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:15.060]   that would make it easier to wiretap people who communicate using the internet instead
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.260]   of phone services.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:20.820]   Right now, you can easily tap a phone, but Skype makes it very difficult.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.540]   And others, I'm sure Google talk as well, make it very difficult to eavesdrop on our
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:28.140]   conversation, Jeff.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:34.340]   This is going to, this is just, yeah, talk about blood pressure raising.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.820]   Boy.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:42.180]   So just watch with interest as our civil liberties go down the tubes, but we've got
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:46.220]   very nice consumer electronics gear.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.140]   And that's what matters.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.780]   We're going to Google IO on Wednesday.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780]   Are you excited?
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.780]   So excited.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:55.780]   Let's get the change log.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:01.100]   We'd like to get some predictions from y'all about what we might see at Google IO, but ready
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.700]   the trumpets because it's time for the change log.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:12.620]   The Google change log.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.460]   And now Gina Trippani with the latest from Google.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.620]   She's wearing it.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.780]   I'm wearing it.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:23.460]   Gmail for iOS got an update that lets you link that links directly to other Google apps.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:28.260]   You can go into Gmail for iOS settings and you can say, hey, use the native YouTube Google
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.100]   maps and crawl maps to open any links inside my messages.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.820]   You can opt out of that by turning it off as well.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.820]   And that's the new update that came out this week.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:42.260]   Google now lets you add calendar events directly from Gmail if you click on a date and time.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.980]   So this is English only for now.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:49.860]   And I believe this is also rolling out this week for people whose language is set to English.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:54.060]   But when you get it, if you get an email with a date and time within the message, you can
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.060]   click on that the date and time and see your calendar.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.700]   So what you have on your Google calendar around that date and time and you can click on add
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:05.740]   the schedule if you want to, which is quite handy.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.860]   Google plus just added remote desktop to hangouts.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:14.820]   So this means that you can, while you're hanging out with someone, if they give you permission
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   and you turn on the remote desktop feature, you can troubleshoot their computer, see what
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.660]   they see on their screen, remote control their computer via hangout.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.500]   So you'll find this feature under the hangout app section.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.340]   And the other user of course will need to grant you permission in order to let you see
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.340]   their screen.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.140]   Finally, the YouTube debuted a new trends map.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:44.580]   If you go to youtube.com/trendsmath, I believe, let me double check that URL.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:45.820]   I believe that's true.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:51.020]   It shows you trending videos in different areas of the United States only, which is kind of
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.020]   cool.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:57.660]   I zoomed in on this and I was checking out trending videos by me amongst females, my age.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:02.540]   I don't want to tell you if it's over low 35 to 44.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:08.380]   Right now, the trending video is the guy who saved the woman who was the women who were
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.180]   locked in that house.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.180]   But it's really cool.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.020]   You can kind of see the different different videos across the country.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:21.220]   You can see in middle America, you'll see kind of country music artists trend, whereas
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.660]   you'll see the trailer for True Blood trending in California.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.380]   So you can see kind of different different people.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:29.780]   And you can filter by gender and age over time.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.780]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.860]   Did I get that URL right?
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.660]   It's youtube.com/trendsmath, right?
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.860]   Yeah, that's what we're looking at.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.860]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.860]   Cool.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.860]   Cool.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.860]   Yeah, that's all I got.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.860]   The change log.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.860]   And that's the change log.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:47.700]   Oh, thank you, Gina.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.620]   So this is how tightly they're controlling glass.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:56.500]   Jason couldn't use my credit card to buy it because it has to be in his name.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.980]   Whoa.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:03.740]   So he's using his own credit card was just have to reimburse you someday.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.740]   What?
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.940]   No, we'll give him a check.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.940]   But that isn't it?
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.580]   They really don't want it to get out of your hands.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:14.540]   I kind of assume that they would use your Google Wallet account, but they wanted a credit
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.540]   card.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.220]   Do they use your wallet account, Jason?
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.220]   No, they use your credit card.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.220]   $1,600.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:24.580]   Yeah, with tax, right?
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.580]   Yep.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.580]   Do that.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.820]   Do do do do.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.900]   And do you have to use Android?
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:31.900]   Can you use?
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.460]   There's no there's no glass app for iOS.
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.460]   Nope.
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.460]   Not yet.
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.460]   Interesting.
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:43.140]   You saw the Saturday Night Live spoof.
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.140]   Fred Armistice.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   I did.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.140]   Very funny.
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   Kind of true.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.140]   It was good.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.140]   I think I'm too close to it.
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.940]   All porn thing was a little much, but yeah, it was fine.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:59.060]   Although ironically, when I was using scobles glass somehow, what was that that showed up,
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.060]   Chad?
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.460]   It was something like it was issued a Google search, right?
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.620]   That was by accident for porn.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.860]   I thought it was a Twitter message.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:08.940]   I couldn't figure it out.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.940]   It was all of a sudden.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.420]   We need to go back to the logs and actually check the footage.
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.580]   Something happened there.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.100]   So here it comes, Google I/O.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.460]   I can't remember how Jun's Berry made fun of PDN.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:23.020]   Yeah, farm.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.260]   It was a joke about the handwriting recognition on Newton.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.460]   And Newton might be a good analog for this.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:32.860]   When Newton came out, I bought one and I had it and I thought it was great, but really
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:36.100]   you had to be an early adopter to think it was great.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:43.140]   And it was merely a look at what wouldn't really take off for at least 10, 15 years.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:50.860]   But I have, there's a video somewhere of me holding, I should find this, my Newton saying,
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:53.220]   you know, someday this will be small, light connected to the internet.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.180]   You could take it with you wherever you go.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.980]   And oh, we're calling Jeff back.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.380]   Is that what that ring is?
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.180]   Now I'm seeing me.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180]   Hey, here we go.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.860]   His audio got a little bit off.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.780]   So we're just fixing the, oh, the sink.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   Okay.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.580]   They say that Gina, you should just say peacock.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.300]   I don't know what happens then.
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.300]   Maybe you better not.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.300]   Why do we get off the air?
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:18.300]   I'm not going to come back and say, yeah, sorry.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.300]   I'll say Italian, Italian restaurant Italian, Italian.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.300]   Italian, Italian.
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:29.140]   Peacock was the Wi-Fi password for the last year.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.140]   Right.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.340]   Peac, peek, peek, peek.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:38.580]   And then he was, it's very funny, very funny.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.360]   So what are we going to see at Google I/O?
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.220]   We will be covering good news.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:47.580]   I'm really happy to see that they've combined the, what used to be three keynotes into one.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.580]   That's great for us.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:53.620]   We will be doing live coverage of the keynote Wednesday morning, not me, Jeff and Gina,
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.900]   however, because we're going to be in the keynote ourselves watching it.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.140]   But then what we're going to do after the tweet.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.740]   Like tweet things to you or.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.740]   Hey, you got glass.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.740]   You could be a hell.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   Oh.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740]   Oh.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.620]   Wouldn't that be funny if Google forbid you to wear glass to the keynote?
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:17.540]   I would surprise if they did actually, well, they do ask people to shut down their Wi-Fi
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:20.660]   to turn off their Wi-Fi because it's such a, so many people.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:24.380]   And so many of those people have, you know, three Wi-Fi enabled devices.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.500]   But if I get a signal in there.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.140]   Oh, I've got.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.460]   So I'm going to bring my, what kind of phone do you have?
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   AT&T.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460]   It's T-Mobile.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460]   T-Mobile.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460]   You know what I love?
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.380]   Don't tell anybody.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.780]   T-Mobile's really good around here.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:45.340]   I'm getting like the HSPA is better than the LTE because nobody uses it.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:46.340]   Awesome.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.420]   It's the best kept secret in cells.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:54.260]   So I'll bring, but I'll bring an AT&T and have Verizon phone.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.260]   You have T-Mobile.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.660]   We'll find the best signal.
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.540]   You can pair the glasses to that and then you can interview me and Jeff.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.100]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.900]   That'd be really fun.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.140]   What are we looking at now?
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.140]   I don't know.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.660]   What are we going to livestream it?
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:09.660]   They're going to livestream it, right?
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.660]   So there's no, yeah.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.660]   So Tom and crew will be here doing-
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.420]   That won't be the same as broadcasting it from your glass.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.980]   No, but they can cut to you then, right?
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.380]   And now let's see what Gina's seeing.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.540]   It's the same thing, only way far back.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.540]   Right, exactly.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.140]   They're really tiny.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.380]   Vic, can judge us this time.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:32.060]   And then we'll come running back and we'll do this week in Google roughly the same time,
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.300]   I think, you know, one or two.
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.220]   Driving very carefully over the bridge.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.980]   We're going to go so carefully down the middle of the bridge.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.540]   We're going to have a police escort.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.980]   Last year, I think we were like a half an hour or 45 minutes late because I had to pick
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.780]   a parental car so there was a little delay there.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.780]   I came straight from-
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.580]   I'm throwing you in the back of my Mustang.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   All right.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.100]   Whoever has a shorter leg, has to sit in the back.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   I think I do.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.980]   Jeff doesn't appear- isn't as tall on Skype as he is a person.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.260]   He's a very tall person.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.220]   People always say that.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.220]   It's kind of a good thing.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:09.660]   It's so tall, I didn't think so.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.340]   So, this personality is short.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.340]   So this will be good.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:17.780]   We'll have good coverage of Google I/O, both coverage live of the keynote and then post-facto
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:20.580]   coverage with Jeff, Gina, and Leo.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.820]   Well, any idea of what we're going to see?
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   Google TV.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.980]   Google TV is going to be big.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:27.980]   Google TV?
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:28.980]   No.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:29.980]   No.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   No.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.460]   Nexus, a new Nexus.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.460]   7.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.460]   New Nexus.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:40.180]   I think a new Nexus X, Motorola successor to Nexus 4.
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.180]   The new Google-
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.140]   Yeah, you think you'll actually release it or-
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.140]   Yeah, why not?
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:50.020]   Actually, we'd know about it because they'd have to have FCC testing by now, right?
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.420]   I think it also reports of a Nexus 4 with LTE.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   Okay.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.020]   That would be nice.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:04.900]   The Nexus 4 has LTE, just not on Verizon.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:08.260]   No, no, no, it doesn't have LTE at all, no.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.820]   No, the report is that there's an antenna in there.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.420]   Oh, internationally it might.
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   It doesn't have the frequencies.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   Well, those don't have LTE internationally.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   Yeah, there is.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.420]   Different frequencies.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.420]   Well, not Europe.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:21.420]   Different frequencies.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.660]   They don't have it at all on Europe?
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.780]   No, because that was a big mess with the selling of bandwidth.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.380]   So, 3G, they just got it.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:31.380]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.580]   They just got it in the UK.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.420]   Somebody in the chatroom says it works on T-Mobile LTE if you use a trick.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.540]   Yeah, there's a band for it.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.140]   I think they disabled, they've got to wait and disable that or something.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.780]   But anyway, LTE.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.740]   What's the new Nexus 7 going to be?
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.740]   Is this the one that they already announced?
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.980]   Yeah, did we hear rumors that there was going to be kind of an updated Nexus 7?
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.820]   They might drop the price.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.900]   It might be a little faster, a couple more features.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:03.340]   Let me see if I can dig up that link at one point.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:08.300]   But they're going to announce at least one new device if not several.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.660]   I mean, every I/O, there's several new devices.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.660]   And I wouldn't be surprised if it was...
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:17.260]   I mean, the Nexus 7 was one of their most successful, amazing devices that they've ever
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.260]   created.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.260]   It seems like it's a huge thing.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.860]   A new interface for Google Maps according to the Google Operating Systems blog.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.460]   Maybe we'll see that.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.860]   Yeah, there's a lot of maps, stuff in the program.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.460]   Thoughts of Google Plus, Matt?
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.460]   Games, maybe?
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.820]   Games, Google Plus, yeah.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.820]   I would love to...
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.220]   You know, I still want to see this.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:42.580]   Please, Google, you have a week to develop it, a Facebook home version for Google Plus.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.980]   Put that right on the Android.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.980]   Beautiful.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.580]   Then we'll all be back with Plus.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:51.140]   We'll just use Plus Plus Plus all the time, Plus.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.660]   I don't think that there's going to be a refresh of the failed Nexus Q.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.220]   No, that's very short.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.220]   In the general world, yeah.
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.220]   Yeah, that's a question.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.220]   For sure.
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:00.220]   Pretty sure we're not going to hear anything.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.220]   How about 4.3?
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.660]   We'll see 4.3, right?
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660]   Yep.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.660]   Yep.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:10.740]   What's the biggest thing that ever came out at an I/O?
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.740]   Glass.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:12.740]   Glass.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740]   Well, but we already knew that was there.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:14.740]   Is there anything that was there?
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.740]   Waves.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   Waves.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.740]   Was wave announced at I/O?
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.740]   Wave was announced at I/O.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.700]   Wave was demoed at I/O.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.700]   I can do this.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.660]   What are you doing?
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.500]   Danny's friend, but he's searching his own archives.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.500]   Peacock.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.500]   Peacock.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.700]   I can do this.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:33.940]   I had glass that had been so much easier.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.260]   You know, last year was the first I/O I missed since they started doing them.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:42.980]   I think Sergey, Sergey on the roof of Moscone Center was pretty hot last week.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   Last year, I'd like that.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980]   Hey, here we are.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.380]   Products announced during past Google I/O keynote.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.380]   So here we are.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.740]   A class of two that you want them to run down?
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:50.740]   I can do it there.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:51.740]   Just pick one.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.740]   Pick the biggest one.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:53.740]   What's the biggest one on that?
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   App Engine.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.740]   Android.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.740]   Oh, that's pretty big.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:00.220]   Developers I/O 2008.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:04.340]   That's big.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.980]   Chrome Store, Google Music, Kinda.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:09.980]   Google TV didn't make it.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.820]   Ooh, how about Babel?
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:12.820]   Babel.
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.580]   That's definitely going to come out.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.940]   There's a very good track record of stuff coming out of Google I/O that goes anywhere.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:24.140]   How about a kid that came out that was supposed to be big that died like Gears, Friend Connect,
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.980]   App Engine, Google Wave.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.580]   The Q, Wave.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.580]   It looks cute.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.380]   It's actually the worst time to announce stuff.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.460]   You kind of don't want to be announced during it.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.940]   I think Babel, I think Babel's ready, don't you think?
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.540]   What are most developers to work on now?
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.540]   Chrome Books.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.380]   Chrome Books for announced.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.620]   Chrome Key Book.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:56.020]   I would love to see what?
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.460]   No, not really.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.460]   I can announce to you.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:00.660]   I'm just kind of kind of excited about Babel.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:01.660]   I am too.
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.660]   I hope it's good.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.660]   I hope it's good.
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.660]   How about a write API for Google Plus?
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:08.260]   Yeah, write API for Google Plus.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:11.100]   Well, there's going to be-- there's tons of Google Plus.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.100]   They could do that.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   They're not going to do that.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.100]   They could have done that so long ago.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.100]   They're not going to do that.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.100]   Yeah, I think it's interesting to talk about it.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.900]   What's the next wave of Google Plus?
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.060]   What could they announce about Google?
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.540]   They're going to announce something about Google Plus.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.540]   It's the thing they care about most.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.180]   What could that be?
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:31.140]   By law, everybody has to use it to use Google.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.140]   Yes, sir.
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.140]   I do know.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.140]   I think that I didn't think it was games.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.140]   I think that I didn't think it was games.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:38.220]   I think that it was not at yet.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.700]   Like the connection between Google Plus and Android,
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.260]   I think will be the game center.
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:45.260]   OK.
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:48.780]   Leaderboards and sharing games and posting activity in games
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.380]   to Google Plus.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.340]   You know, that activities API where you can publish
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.260]   what you're doing to Google Plus?
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.140]   We'll be there.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:56.740]   We'll be there.
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.900]   And we'll let you know.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.620]   You'll hear it here first.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.100]   And then our analysis last.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.660]   I'm Matt at Yahoo.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.660]   Marissa Meyer had the chance to buy to-do text.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:08.540]   Instead, she bought that Astrid to-do list.
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.940]   It was actually great for to-do text because everyone was like,
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.220]   oh, so companies can get shut down.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.140]   I can lose my data.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.860]   I can't use my data when I own it.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.140]   And it's in my own drop-offs.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.300]   And there's years ago.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.300]   There's years ago.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.460]   I had a spike in sales.
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:20.980]   So thank you.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.940]   Really?
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.780]   People are smart.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.860]   So Astrid, which is, I thought, a very good to-do list.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.620]   It's very good.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.860]   It was our main-- most people would say,
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.500]   oh, if to-do text doesn't do what you need to do,
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.380]   get Astrid, which I was fine with.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:32.820]   Right.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.980]   Or any.do.
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.700]   Well, now there's Astrid's gone.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.100]   Now, are they shutting it down?
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:40.500]   They're going to--
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.580]   They already have.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:45.220]   Apparently, they're pulling it out of the Play Store.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.060]   Oh, they're pulling the store.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:46.420]   That's right.
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:47.580]   Yes, yeah.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.700]   4 million downloads to date.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.620]   It's a pretty big number.
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.380]   Yeah, that's very good.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:56.060]   If you've previously purchased Astrid-paid products,
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:59.980]   Yahoo will give you a refund.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.780]   Wow.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.580]   That doesn't sound good.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.380]   How much is it?
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.340]   Well, I think Astrid's free, but then there's
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.860]   these locale plug-ins and power packs and--
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:09.940]   Oh, the power pack, right.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.140]   --and these subscriptions.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.620]   So wow, refund.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.620]   That's pretty hardcore.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:20.020]   All right.
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:20.540]   If Astrid's--
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:20.980]   Good for them.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:21.740]   Congratulations.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.460]   Yeah, good for them and good for you.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.180]   I'm glad to hear that people are smart.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.060]   That's we should mention.
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:29.820]   To-do text, your do list is stored in a text file,
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.820]   in text format, in Dropbox.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.620]   Automatically synchronized works great.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.740]   It's easy to use.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:39.780]   You can even have command line interfaces to it, which I did.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   Now, I'm--
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:41.740]   You did.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.100]   You did.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.420]   I had a bash shell.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.940]   I had a bash script that would add--
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.020]   do all that stuff.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.260]   I got that from you.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:48.940]   Nice.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.060]   Hey, so I'm excited about Dropbox-enabled apps,
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:52.460]   or not even just Dropbox.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.820]   Drive, Google Drive, or whatever.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.380]   Would you support Drive with the to-do text?
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:58.420]   Yeah, I mean, we could.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:58.940]   We could.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.780]   We had on our do list forever, well,
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.460]   support multiple cloud providers.
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:04.220]   But honestly, because it's kind of a weekend project,
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.060]   it's an open source thing.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.460]   Just stuck with Dropbox, and we're just working on the UI.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.060]   But we couldn't easily do a version, or add, you know,
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:13.220]   Drive as an option to store there.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.140]   Have you seen Fargo.io?
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.740]   This is Dave Weiner's.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.740]   Outliner, this also syncs to Dropbox.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.220]   So I'm kind of excited about it.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:21.540]   I like--
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.020]   I like the idea--
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:24.500]   --to WordPress, too.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.580]   This is the one that works with WordPress as well.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:31.260]   So Fargo is an outliner, but he points out,
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:34.420]   you could use it to the list or a notepad.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.220]   And it stores the docs in Dropbox.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.420]   Yeah, it's OPML files.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.100]   So I love this.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.860]   Like open standards, your own cloud storage,
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:41.860]   distributed cloud storage.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:45.660]   I mean, you really can build a Chrome app that
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.700]   uses sync between local storage and your cloud provider
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.860]   of choice.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.980]   And you don't need takeout, right?
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.100]   You don't need to depend on a centralized service.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.260]   You can kind of own your own data and store it
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.940]   and use different clients for it.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:58.580]   All right.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.340]   We're going to take a break.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.100]   We'll come back with Gina's tool.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:06.860]   Our tip, our number of the week coming up triangulation
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.100]   with Mr. Adam Corolla is going to be our guest.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.100]   It's going to give me some love advice.
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.100]   Love it.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.620]   But first, a word from hover.com.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.620]   The reliable domain name registration and management
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.420]   service that we use and we recommend.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:22.980]   It's simple.
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:23.740]   It's honest.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.380]   It's clean.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.020]   It's easy to use.
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.540]   No more of the upsell.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.300]   No more of the sexy ads.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:33.220]   It takes the hassle out of owning and managing domain names.
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.260]   Great domain management tools.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.700]   It's clean.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.700]   I just love it.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.620]   And by the way, they have some great customer service.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.540]   When you call hover.com during business hours,
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.420]   you'll be talking to a live rep who is empowered and eager
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:47.980]   to help you.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:51.340]   No more putting you on hold or transferring to somebody
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:51.940]   could do something.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.460]   You're going to talk to somebody right away.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.740]   It's awesome.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:59.940]   They've got all the big top level domains.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.220]   Often people go there.
[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:02.620]   They told me to search for .com.
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.420]   And one of the things they do now is when the .com address
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:06.740]   is not available, they also show you
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.380]   that same domain and .net, which is really actually
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.980]   a pretty good domain name.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:16.300]   They also have some of the unusual ones.tv.pro.moby.biz.
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:21.060]   Country codes like .causasia.uk.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.420]   Of course, .org.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.860]   It is a great place.
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:27.060]   This week in Google.net.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:27.980]   See?
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.860]   Somebody's already got .com.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.060]   We could be a nonprofit.org.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.540]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.380]   There's that week in Google.com.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.660]   That's the other show.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.900]   This week in Google.pro.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:41.980]   Google.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:43.860]   That's the bizarro.
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.860]   We should get one in German.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:48.860]   You could be Farfung Nugen or whatever it is.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.220]   For guys--
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.700]   It's the Volka in Google.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.300]   So I want you to try it.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.100]   Go to hover.com.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.340]   And by the way, we're going to give you a deal 10% off
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.420]   when you use our offer code Twig.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:02.900]   So hover.com/twig will automatically activate that code.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.300]   You'll get 10% off.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.100]   Your first purchase is hover.com/twig.
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:12.100]   Use the offer code TWIG and enjoy.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.300]   It is a really great service.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.300]   I'll get all my domain names over there now.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.060]   And new ones all the time.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.580]   Because it's fun to register domains.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:25.660]   Now time for our tip and tool and pick and number.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.580]   And let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.180]   Just a quick little tip this week.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.180]   Google has added Street View images
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:37.420]   to its one box result or an address, which is kind of neat.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.060]   So if you Google, say for instance, 140 Keller
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.860]   Street, Petaluma, California, you'll
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:44.420]   get a little map, a little Google Map
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.220]   of the top of the search results, which you'd always get.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.420]   But then you also get the Street View of that address.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.780]   So I'm excited for you to get your sign up, Leo.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.540]   Because maybe your sign will be right there
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.780]   at the top of your search results.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.940]   And you can click on the Street View image
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.860]   and go straight into Street View mode inside Google Maps,
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.180]   which is nice.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:03.140]   It will transport you directly to right outside the brick house.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.580]   And then you can walk in because we did do a 3D
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.100]   internal mapping.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.700]   That's where-- by the way, that's where the sign's going to go.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.300]   See, that old sign is down.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.540]   And it's going to go right there above the window.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.580]   It's going to be just copper 3D letters
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.460]   that are going to stick out this age, just TWIT.
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.140]   Very subtle.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.540]   Did you have to go through zoning stuff?
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.700]   Apparently not.
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:23.860]   No, there is some permitting.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.740]   Yes, actually that's part of the cost.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:27.180]   But see, you can go right in.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:27.700]   Yeah, this is awesome.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.380]   Apparently, we're on some list of Easter eggs
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.300]   or unusual things that you found while inside Google.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.220]   Yeah, you're on the best--
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:34.740]   right.
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:37.740]   Yeah, some sort of weird thing like that.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.740]   Yeah, this is awesome.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:39.780]   How did you arrange it?
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.140]   Did you have somebody come in with the backpack?
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.660]   Yeah, you have to pay.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.100]   There are people who are trusted providers.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.700]   Somebody contacted us.
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.380]   I think it was from Texas.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:51.140]   There's me with the booze and the dog.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.460]   So you were doing a show while they came in at that so far?
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:55.140]   Actually, I came back the next day,
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.340]   because when he first did it, I wasn't there.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.060]   Yeah, I was doing-- it looks like the radio show.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:00.740]   Sweet.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:05.860]   I'm surprised, Gina, that you did not mention pushover.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.140]   I've been playing with pushover.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.540]   I really dig it.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.940]   Are you going to use pushover with Leo?
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.700]   Well, when I saw your tweet, I saw--
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.420]   or whatever it was, was it a plus or a tweet?
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.100]   I immediately signed up for it, because I
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.260]   think this is really kind of intriguing.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:19.940]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.140]   It's kind of a developer tool right now.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:24.300]   So it's an expensive app, relatively.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.500]   It's a $5 mobile notifications app.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.140]   And it's just a way for some apps
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.940]   to work with it can push notifications to it.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.540]   And I actually wanted to building a pushover plug-in
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:34.340]   for ThinkUp, because we didn't--
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.980]   we just haven't gotten to the place
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.900]   we're going to build our native app yet,
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:38.980]   but I wanted to get notifications.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:40.220]   So I hooked it up to pushover.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:45.020]   But IFTTT, if this, then that, has some hooks in a pushover.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:45.380]   So you can say--
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.980]   That's where you probably want to use it.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.660]   So if you say, hey, if I want to know immediately
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:53.180]   if an RSS feed changes, for example, in IFT,
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.260]   you can say if the RSS feed changes send me
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.580]   a pushover notification.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.380]   So yeah, I didn't bring it up, because it was kind of more--
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.660]   it's kind of more of a developer tool, I guess, right now.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   But it is cool if you want to chain together recipes
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.100]   in IFTTT.
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.020]   It's a neat, it's a pretty neat app.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.980]   And they give you code snippets for every--
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.700]   it's very simple.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.780]   It's JSON, so it's very simple to add that capability.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:14.660]   And watch, I'm going to send myself a notification here.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.140]   I've set up my phone.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.380]   I'm doing this on the website.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:21.420]   And default default-- I'm going to send myself a bugle.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:28.580]   And I'm going to say, hey, Leo, it's time for triangulation.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:31.340]   And then I'll send this message, and it'll go to my S4,
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.940]   and it'll play a little bugle sound.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:34.980]   It's kind of neat.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:35.980]   [DING]
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:36.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.500]   I know you saw that.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.620]   And then the little message pops up that tells me
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620]   it's time for triangulation.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.740]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.700]   And I feel like there's going to be ways to use this.
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:51.220]   So things like your nest might be able to use it to say, hey,
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.380]   it's getting hot in here.
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:54.220]   I'm taking off my clothes or something.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:55.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.220]   Exactly.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.380]   Some sort of useful thing.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.980]   It's great for any kind of monitoring scripts or anything
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.860]   that you just want to know that something go wrong.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.340]   It's really nice.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.140]   Instead of getting an asset, getting a phone call,
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.460]   you can get pushover notification.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.300]   And it's nice you can set quiet hours.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.220]   You can say you sound for this or not.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.180]   It's really flexible.
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:13.940]   It's a good app.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.980]   Well worth the $5.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.780]   Yeah, pushover.net, I think.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:18.300]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.780]   Jeff Jarvis, you're noomba-er.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.540]   Well, I guess given the title of the show,
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.180]   I've got to do this one.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:30.660]   Google hit an all-time high at $873.88 per share.
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.860]   Market cap now of $289.84 billion worth more than Microsoft
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.220]   in all possible ways.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:37.740]   Wow.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.740]   Wow.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:39.740]   That's an $875.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.740]   Wow.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.740]   $875.88.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:42.740]   Amazing.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.740]   Hey, Danny, is anything you want to recommend or mention?
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:50.740]   You know, I would say that if you haven't-- if you've got an iOS
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.740]   and you haven't tried the new Google search app,
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:53.740]   you should go do it.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:54.740]   It's been very interesting.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.740]   It's the one that gave you the Google Now functionality.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:01.740]   And when it came out last week, I showed my trainer.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:02.740]   I was like, hey, you any have iPhone?
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:03.740]   You should check this out.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:04.740]   And I saw them on a fun day.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.740]   And on Fridays, like, I'm going to do this.
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.740]   And I saw Fridays, like, oh my god, this is great.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.740]   I'm getting all this stuff.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.740]   This has changed my life.
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:13.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.740]   But he really liked it.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:20.740]   But it's really-- Google Now is really developed into this pretty
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.740]   awesome predictive search tool where it's coming up with information
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.740]   before you think about it.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.740]   And what I think is most interesting that I found is that, you know,
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:30.740]   when they relaunched the Google search app in October of last year,
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.740]   you could speak to it.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:34.740]   And it would talk back to you kind of like Siri.
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:39.740]   That got it up to the top 16 of the most downloaded apps on iTunes.
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.740]   And then it kicked all the ways down.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.740]   And then before this latest update, it was around 150.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.740]   It is in the top 10 right now.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.740]   And it's been holding that way so far.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.740]   So suddenly, you know, Google has finally gotten something in terms of
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:57.740]   Google search that's causing people to think, oh, yeah, I should search
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:00.740]   Google, but not just by doing it through Safari in that little box.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:03.740]   I should actually use the Google search app a lot more.
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:04.740]   And I think Google Now has a lot to do with it.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:05.740]   So I'd say check it out.
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:11.740]   I am going to-- I've done a review already of the Galaxy S4.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:16.740]   I ordered the 8-core version.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.740]   That's the one I'm using on T-Mobile.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.740]   It works really great with T-Mobile.
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.740]   And I was using, as you remember, the HTC One was very impressed by that.
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:28.740]   But I have to say, this is much more of a pure Android experience.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.740]   HTC's really kind of munged up a lot of the features of Android.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.740]   If you want more Android, this is a great phone.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.740]   I have to say, camera not as good, maybe as the HTC One,
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.740]   but interchangeable battery gives it a leg up.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.740]   I'm a big fan.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.740]   This is an incipio case, but I have a couple others on order.
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:48.740]   But the Galaxy S4, very, very, very nice.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.740]   Is it a big step above the three?
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:51.740]   No.
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.740]   The screen is great.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:56.740]   I mean, 1920 by 1080, there's a lot of crap wear on it.
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.740]   They really loaded it up.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.740]   But you can ignore it.
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.740]   And you can even, you know, disable it so you don't see it.
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:06.740]   Nevertheless, I have to say, the speed, the better screen.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:09.740]   And the camera's got some nice features to it.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.740]   Some really gimmicky features to it.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:16.740]   It's just like a somewhat better Galaxy S3.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.740]   It's the four.
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:19.740]   It's the next one.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.740]   It comes with a ridiculously low paltry amount of memory,
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.740]   free memory, about 8 gigabytes.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.740]   But I put an SD card in there.
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.740]   And I guess 16 gigabyte versions are coming.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:32.740]   But my real tool of this week is Google.com.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.740]   You've got to go see the Google Doodle for this week.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.740]   Can you show my screen, Chad?
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:37.740]   This is just this year.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:42.740]   This today's Google Doodle is so awesome.
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.740]   Are you getting audio?
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:48.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:51.740]   Love this.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:57.740]   Was it you, Danny, that said that normally I hate Google Doodles,
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.740]   but this one I really like.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.740]   I'm all right, but it's nice to me.
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:04.740]   It's kind of elaborate.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.740]   You figured it out yet?
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:12.740]   It's a tribute.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:16.740]   I guess it's his birthday.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:20.740]   It's one of the great screen title designers of all time.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.740]   That's from the Northwest to Title S.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:26.740]   We do a lot of Hitchcock.
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.740]   And this is an HTML5.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:30.740]   This is YouTube.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:32.740]   This is-- oh, yeah, you're right.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.740]   It's a YouTube video.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.740]   It's not HTML5.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.740]   Wow.
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:40.740]   So, uh, it goes on, too.
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.740]   It do go on.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.740]   I guess that's why they made it a YouTube video.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:49.740]   By the way, if we're into watching the video right now,
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:50.740]   I also recommend it.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.740]   You can kill the audio so we can hear Jeff.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.740]   What?
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.740]   What, Jeff?
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.740]   I just want to watch the rest of that.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:00.740]   If you're watching video, I also recommend to all of you,
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:03.740]   Dick Costolo's commencement speech at University of Michigan,
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.740]   President of Twitter.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.740]   All right, I will watch that.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:07.740]   Awesome.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.740]   So happy-- I guess it has Sawbass birthday,
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.740]   May 8th, Sawbass is a birthday.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:15.740]   Happy birthday, Sawbass, one of the great graphic designers,
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.740]   the king of the opening credits.

[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.740]   all through the show.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:43:59.740]   That's great.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.740]   Thank you for doing that.

[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.740]   We've got one minute till the baby says,
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:15.740]   "Oh, she's taking a picture."
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:16.740]   Glass.
