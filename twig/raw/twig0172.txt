[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   What the heck's wrong? What do I do with Leo? Leo is gone. He's having a good time. He's on a boat. He's in Australia.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.120]   He's drinking God knows what having a great time. So we're here though. Twig goes on. I'm Jeff Jarvis.

[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   week. It's painful. It's horrible. It's not the way the natural way things should be. But of course
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.880]   at least we have I'm back. I'm Jeff Jarvis and I'm back and we have of course always the wonderful
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   Gene Andrew-Penny. Over to that direction. Hello we have the Brady Bunch set up. We do and below
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.840]   is Kevin Marks. Hi there. Hello. And see if I get this right. And that way I do it right. Yeah
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:36.240]   that way. Hi is Nis Howell and we're in a pretty much solo all. Great to see you Jeff. Great to be
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   here. Great to be back in New York with Power and all is well here. So I figured we'd start off
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:49.840]   this week with right. Are you ready Chad? The changelog. Google changelog.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   It's the week before Thanksgiving which is really good news because it means that everything gets
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.160]   released. There's tons of new stuff in the Google world this week. Let's get it started.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.840]   Google+ now allows users to directly download Android apps from the stream. So if you link to
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.760]   an Android app you love which I found out the other day when I was promoting my app to do text.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.400]   Other users will see a buy link. They click on the buy link and choose the device they want to
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.640]   install to and they can get their Android apps directly from the Google+ stream. Gmail got a
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.200]   couple of new search parameters. I really like this. Gmail has a ton of search parameters like
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.480]   to and from and subject. It has attachment. Got a couple new ones. You can find messages that
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.560]   are larger than a certain size. So if you want to find messages that are really big you want to
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.040]   clean out your inbox. You can search for size colon say 5m for messages which are 5 megabytes
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.000]   or you can search for larger colon 5m for messages that are larger than 5 megabytes.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.080]   You can also find email by date. So if you wanted to find a message that was older than a year
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.160]   there's a new search parameter called it's it's it's you use it older underscore than colon
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.560]   one y for older than one year. What a quick concept clean out your inbox.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.000]   Just in case you know you're topping out your 10 gigabytes of Gmail space and you need to clean
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.400]   out some bigger ones you can do that now with a search parameter. YouTube for Android the
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.240]   YouTube app for Android adds airplay like functionality for Google TV. So if you've got your Nexus 7
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.840]   or your Android device in your living room and you've also got a Google TV and you're watching a
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.800]   YouTube video you can send it to your TV and watch it on the big screen. This is really similar to
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   airplay for for the Apple universe and really similar to actually what the Nexus Q did but so
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.200]   few people have the Nexus Q it's kind of nice to see that built into the YouTube app for you know
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.080]   for regular Google TV TV devices. Google says that flash is now fully sandboxed in the latest release
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.400]   of Chrome. Sandbox just means that each flash plug-in or any bit of content on any web page where
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.120]   flash is being used is completely it's completely it's sandbox it's contained within a process that
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.920]   it can't you basically can't run malicious software on your on your computer so a little safer a
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.600]   little more secure and the most recent version of Chrome. Google also updated the the play music
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   app for Android and they announced European availability. The the new play app adds the ability to keep
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.400]   thumbs up last added and purchase playlist on your device and it also has this new auto-generated
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.840]   instant mixes in the recent tabs based on your favorite songs and also has improved offline music
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.680]   access as well. Google shopping gearing up for the holiday season they add a new feature called
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.560]   shortlist which is a lot like wishlist so when you search in Google shopping for a product you can
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.640]   add a product to your shortlist and the shortlist are really nice they include product images prices
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.720]   you can add comments and notes and you can share shortlist with other people so if you're making
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.000]   wishlist for the kids or if you're shopping with co-workers to give a gift to someone else you can
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.440]   you can share and comment and discuss each each product on your on your shortlist and Google shopper
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   3.0 which is the android app also adds some new features local deals based on your location deals
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   online and new good guide ratings which tell you how echo conscious a product is also just redesigned
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.680]   home screen which is very image heavy makes it easier to shop for products.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.200]   Is the same where they get the data on the echo conscious stuff jenna?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.240]   It's good guide good guide ratings so i'm not sure if you've got a third party or if that's a
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.280]   if that's a google line. Finally android 4.2 the new new flavor of jelly bleat being quote unquote
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.680]   has gone has an over the air update has pushed out to the galaxy nexus phone the nexus 7 but not
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.640]   the nexus s and we talked about this last couple of shows that the new jelly bean update includes
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.560]   new features like multiple user supports which in users the swipe feature in the keyboard and the
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.480]   photosphere feature in the camera which lets you take 360 degree views of picture so we could
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.880]   talk about a little bit more about that later on because i think a few of us have gotten the update
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.080]   that's it that's all i got for the change wow that's not
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.120]   i stepped on the outside. Can i ask you a follow-up question? Absolutely. Do you know if the the
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.800]   airplay functionality for youtube is is there any thought that that might just work with chrome
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.040]   that you're on a laptop whether it's a chrome book or some other laptop and as long as you're
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.280]   using the chrome browser that might work? That would be really nice no word about that but
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.800]   that would be really nice i mean the the thing about the the airplay thing is that you have to
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.600]   have a google tv so so there's that yeah it would be nice you know i've been using the watch later
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.800]   feature in youtube so i add stuff to watch later if i'm on i found you know in browser and then
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.560]   on the google tv go to the youtube app there and then go to watch later which is super clumsy and
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.360]   requires lots of clicks it would be really neat to see that send to my tv in chrome i would love
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.880]   to see that. Well speaking of google tv we might as well look over this one it too has updated in
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.480]   the never-ending google effort to finally make the product actually decent
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   so now it has voice search and a new prime time guide is that something you
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.520]   is already automatically on your google tv jim? I have the the logitech review so the review didn't
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.400]   get the voice search feature it did get the youtube update that i just talked about and i think that
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:29.360]   it did get the the prime time guide update although my setup is a little is a little messed up but
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.280]   i'm not quite getting cable listings correctly for for reasons i won't get into so you have to
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.200]   have a newer google tv device so i think that those updates that the voice search particularly
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.880]   is rolling out to logitech TVs and then the second second generation what they're calling
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.040]   second generation google tv devices unfortunately. Do the other two of you have google tv?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:55.920]   i don't i have an apple tv and it's one of the older models so i don't have airplay on it anyway
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:08.400]   but i love the idea i have an apple tv and an x-sq so i've got both those options
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.440]   the release notes for jelly beans say you can share anything on your screen on hdtv
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.720]   but there's no clue about how you do that i don't know what's on your screen
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:29.200]   but i can't see i can't see how you would do that i can't see any settings for that so
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.440]   there's a let me maybe that's a promise rather than a delivered thing or maybe jadees i think
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.600]   you're on the right thing where you where you're shist up across i am now gone or i have my next
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   and seven i have my um a galaxy that says and it has arrived at last i have my chrome book
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.240]   so i have begun my bold experiment to live only in google ville
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.280]   i'm gonna i'm gonna live only in chrome on computer stuff and i'm gonna live only in my android
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.600]   devices on my things and i will report back in a few weeks to see how it goes if i haven't killed
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.560]   myself between now and then yeah i i don't think you're gonna be alone in that too long, Jeff
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   no i think i'm liking it so far the the the quick note is it's stupid to have a search button not
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   a caps lock button it actually crashes a little bit uh but of course it's just a browser so it
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   comes right back um you know the screen is a little tinny old plasticy but it's pretty darn
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:33.120]   amazing that everything i need for $249 and google today announced a new chrome book for only $199
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   with three and a half hours of battery power so it's pretty sweet too uh i just uh set why i got
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:48.800]   this for my son because his school is all google docs uh google drive you know the whole
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.160]   universe of work they do at school is in the google ecosystem so it's really gonna make sense for him
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.840]   now youtube power users there are you looking down your nose at us for having these uh talka toys
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:09.120]   no never you know someone in the travel room said uh web 6960 said youtube airplane thing works with
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.360]   playstation 3 tv premiere xbox 360 google tv and other smart tv's but i the stores that i saw said
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   that it was google tv only did do kevin do you know if if this is true does it work with xbox 360 and
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.600]   those other devices i don't know i'm i'm trying to find something other than this press release
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.960]   thing to explain what the feature is say yeah yeah sorry y'all we're we're frantically googling
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.440]   as we talk the chat room will provide momentarily i'm sure well we need a link chat room
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.080]   so the other part of the other news of course is this week uh google released finally its new
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.880]   nexus 4 and nexus 10 for sale for about 30 freaking seconds um i tried desperately and i don't know
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.320]   why i have my my google nexus phone i'm happy with it but i just can't help myself i i i'm feeling
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.400]   like leo this week so of course i have to justify buying any new gadget as soon as it comes out
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.960]   and i was going to buy the uh nexus 4 i saw across the world in australia and then in europe people
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.600]   were cursing and growling because they couldn't get it they got on and they were refreshing refreshing
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.400]   refreshing refreshing the report was it was going to go on sale here at noon eastern time
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:27.280]   9 a.m. pacific time at about 11 35 a.m. my time it turned out to be on sale so i refreshed and
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   refreshed and refreshed and refreshed trying to constantly go to every step of the buy process
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.520]   finally once for the 16 gig i got all the way to the attic of my credit card done i hit it and then
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.360]   it says boom basically was sold out i i stupidly then go to i need some advice for you guys in a
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.920]   second i go to the eight gig i do it again and again and again and apparently i don't get it
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.200]   then two hours later i find that i a a purchase confirmation that i have an eight gig coming my way
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.080]   first thing is google can do everything well but it can't run a store better than freaking radio
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:10.880]   shack why can't do this is this hard really it's it's just uh too much for brick and mortar thing
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.560]   maybe it's really remarkable how how hard it is now they might have had you know five units
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   i thought this scarcity was great you can go on you can buy the new nexus 7 you can buy other
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.120]   things right now but you just can't up and and the 10 i think is still available but you can't buy
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.960]   the the nexus 4 and and you know so maybe they wanted that because it looks like they're popular
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.080]   but it really was a very frustrating experience i saw some guy put up on twitter a list of five
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.280]   cancelled purchases he said i either have zero or eight coming i can't tell
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:48.400]   j]f i think this is a Jarvis Easter i think google anytime you try to purchase a google device as
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.040]   soon as they see your name there there's some sort of snafu pre-programmed
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:00.160]   right i hear you guys is is it while having an eight gig or should i just return it and wait for
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:09.040]   the 16 gig i think it's worthwhile i mean i i'm finding that more and more on tablets and phones
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   storage is becoming irrelevant there's not so much that i need to store there because so much is
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:23.680]   streamed yeah i mean you know more is always always better with storage around but i haven't you know
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.360]   i've got the aching version of this and i haven't run into problems with it so i think they're
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.080]   getting better at sort of paging stuff in and out as you need it the way the google play stuff works
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.120]   with music is is pretty impressive on this now because it will cash stuff if you ask it to but
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.480]   generally as long as you've got some kind of connection it'll pull stuff down
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.360]   so jina which which photo are you using regularly now i switch between the the
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.320]   iPhone 4s and the galaxy nexus um just mostly just kind of keep up with with with what's going on
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.560]   with both and i test my app on both um you know it's funny i've been using the iPhone a lot just
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.480]   because the camera seems just feels really fast and i just been taking a lot of pictures of the baby
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.920]   and i have to get her that you know that one second that it looks like maybe she's smiling
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:14.080]   so but i have to say that this this jelly bean update is really really cool so i think i might
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.440]   switch back to the galaxy nexus so i'm kind of between the two of them but they're both they're
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   both live and i grab one of the other and i use google voice so it it rings and textible
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   i just talked a little bit more about what you've seen so far from the update
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.760]   so um the bit of the update i was really excited about was the multiple user support so you can
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.400]   switch users and that doesn't make very much sense on a phone but it makes a ton of sense on a tablet
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.240]   so the nexus seven is kind of our you know in my house is our living room computer my wife and
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.800]   i both use it and i really like the idea that she and i can both have our account set up separate home
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.200]   screens separate app separate email accounts the whole thing and so we pick it up we can you know
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.160]   we can log in as as whoever it is and and have all of our stuff and it's done really nicely you know
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.320]   if i download an app um and use it it it collects data but then if she decides to use that app it
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.440]   doesn't redo redo the download but all the settings are new that's really nice uh the other kind of
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.240]   big difference is the keyboard has that swipe functionality where you kind of drag your finger
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.360]   from one letter to the other and it guesses what word you're trying to type and i actually i really
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.600]   like this i really like the swipe um swipe with a y app key alternate keyboard on android a
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.760]   while back i wrote a piece about it a while back and it's actually really nicely done in this just
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.600]   jellybean update i've only played with it a little bit the last few hours but you can have a choice
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.160]   you can use the swipe or not and it's and it looks you know very similar to the regular keyboard
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.960]   it's nicely done and of course the photosphere feature which uh kevin was just trying to take a
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:45.440]   360 uh photo of his backyard and i don't think it went so well it's different than panorama
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.520]   you kind of need to kind of walk around and uh and take your picture take your photo kind of as
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.200]   as you go versus a panorama you kind of move the camera it sounds like you have to kind of move
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.480]   your whole body to get a picture although i'm still still trying to get that right but once you get
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.360]   it you get this 360 view and you can upload it to google maps tied to your location which is really
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   nice and i think those are the major features that i did i miss anything
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:17.920]   i think you pretty much got it yeah uh different clock uh people notice um uh when you sign on it
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   has a big size on it just you know different font these are the kinds of silly things that happen
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.240]   people usually care about we don't different uh different clock there um so you know uh fairly minor
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.760]   uh the galaxy nexus s will not have this update right but the nexus will so i don't know what other
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.720]   units will get and won't get the update which probably be very frustrating for folks um the other
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:50.080]   news out uh in nexus land was that of course as i said the the nexus seven uh is now on sale they have
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   the the cell phone enabled version of it for for what is it uh 29 32 gig plus uh online connectivity
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.120]   unlocked that's on sale and available now they have the the 10 available and there was one report
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   that i put in the and the update that said that um the nexus seven is actually has some new um small
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.440]   changes in the hardware inside and that it's allegedly faster so i don't know if that's true or not
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.520]   yeah allegedly it is faster than and this the the is it the larger i thought someone the chat
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.000]   room said the the one that had more gigabytes was was supposedly faster but i'm not i'm not sure
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   there was a speed test on the next web it's up on the uh chat it's up on the the rundown under
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.360]   android um you know so i don't know it's but it's minor it's not a big deal i'm i'm you know the
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.280]   i haven't touched my iphone now in two or three weeks i haven't touched my ipad in probably two
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.720]   months uh so i've really found myself switching from apple disease to to google disease
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:05.600]   i can't be you know i think you're kind of unique jeff that that you you were already so entrenched
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.800]   in the apple universe and you're extricating yourself and uh adopting a whole new paradigm as it were
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.920]   but i could in our household i could definitely see it being generational because with my son with
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.880]   his Chromebook and then ultimately when he gets old enough to have a phone it would be logical to
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.760]   keep him in that ecosystem and you know i could just see you know it'll be sort of like having
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.640]   republicans and democrats living under the same roof which we also have so is the technological
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:39.120]   Alex Keaton yes i'm sorry my lights go off i've got to go i've got to go dance and prove to them
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:48.080]   alive sorry i'm back i'm back legal doesn't do this only when you get the um the backups
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.400]   and geneed into this heater all right so uh i thought because we have um Denise here there were
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:01.280]   a couple of law stories that were pretty interesting and uh related to the law uh and rights and so on
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:09.200]   and oddly enough i find the patreus story besides being um odd and tawdry in all kinds of ways
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.560]   the questions that i thought might be interesting for us to explore are the privacy issues you know
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.080]   i've argued that the government is not our best protector of privacy it is our greatest threat to
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.920]   privacy and and if you look at what happened to the patreus story where just to recount is that if i
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.840]   correct me i've got this wrong here but there was a complaint from uh i think this the the floor
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:37.120]   at a social aid named miss kelly because she was getting threatening emails uh and so she called on
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.200]   her friend at the fbi who later and i don't understand this part at all sent shirtless pictures of
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.000]   himself whatever um and turned out to be of course the biographer of patreus who was sending
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.040]   allegedly the threatening emails that revealed the affair that lost patreus's job then there's
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.640]   the connection of of his number two general in afghanistan to uh the social aid again gocker as
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.440]   a whole chart trying to explain all this stuff fine so that's the togri part that everybody's
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:13.520]   covering but the part that that concerns me here is if this these exchanges had happened in snail
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   mail or even if they'd happened on the telephone they wouldn't have been so easy for the fbi to come
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   in and what does this mean for all the rest of us is it just different because this is the head of
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:32.800]   the cia or does this reveal a security risk for all of us when it comes to our communications and
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.680]   illustrates how we do not have the right of secure and private communication in email as we know
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:49.040]   versus the males counselor yes well you've hit you've hit on a problem uh that exists offline as well
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.160]   when the government is investigating something when law enforcement is uh as happened here
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.960]   um that if someone is cooperating with them and providing them with a bunch of evidence you know
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   they're gonna come through it and if they find other tidbits in there that may be criminal or
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.320]   you know prompt some separate investigation they don't have to get a separate warrant they don't
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.840]   have to turn away and pretend they didn't see that thing um they can go ahead and use it it's you
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.640]   know in in the real world you know say you have marijuana on your car seat and you're stopped it's
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.840]   called the plain view doctrine and i think that we're seeing it carrying over here um to this woman's
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.080]   email account and that's that's how you know this whole thing unfolded would that be true if they had
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   print emails and print mails i mean i mean you know snail mail yeah i think so you know as long as
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.120]   she had provided all this stuff and said you know here's here's everything i have on the issue i'm
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.680]   being you know stalked or whatever it was she told them um they they clearly can go through it and
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.520]   and they don't need a warrant they don't really need um any other permission of the people whose
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:11.200]   data is in their hands you know being provided by this woman who prompted the investigation so
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.360]   yeah it's kind of a big security leak right there was also more metadata of course associated
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.720]   with the emails where you could track it back in a way that was harder to be anonymous i read
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.400]   one story i wish i remember where i think within your times that explained that the spy craft
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:33.520]   that patreus and broadbend evidently uh broadwell evidently used was to create a um if i guess
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.040]   it's right back at this wrong here to create a separate um email account and rather than sending
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.440]   emails to each other just sharing the password of that one account and you left your message there
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.680]   like a message drop and the old spy craft and then a long drop yeah and read it and it's supposed
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.960]   to kill it but the problem was that then runwell created another account and started using stuff
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.120]   in ways that i don't know exactly where it goes
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.920]   i'm sure should i be troubled by this or not technology genesis
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:10.640]   well i mean i well partly if this illustrates a um a gap in the law in that um the ecpa means
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.040]   that this stuff is in subject to the fourth amendment so if people can search it um without
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.280]   getting a warrant and that that that is an issue it's a huge yes and this this is because if that
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.800]   law was written back back in the 80s and they assumed that anything
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.080]   still on a server after 180 days was abandoned and therefore they could look it up um and you know
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.120]   Gmail sort of blows that up completely because of everything they keep everything forever so that
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.160]   there's a sort of legal definition of email that dates from the 80s that is now being used to let
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.760]   them troll every email you've ever sent um or received and it looks like they would they would
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.880]   it there was initially some she hired over some accounts voluntarily and then they got access to
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.240]   other accounts partly because they'd seen some of the emails back and forth and then they went
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.320]   and looked on the servers for this stuff that that was the impression we've got from this not just
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.920]   that um some of the stuff that's been received so the rule is James Fallows at the Atlantic Center
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.120]   of course never put anything in an email or electronics that you wouldn't have problems
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.840]   without there the old the other statement of that rule is if you put it in email make sure it's okay
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.520]   that appears on the front page of the New York Times uh a little d&l um
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   be a lot of that common sense rule Gina you know how what advice would you have for people here
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.520]   I mean I think it's just a it's just kind of a matter of of of awareness of these things you
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.560]   know I mean I think it's a matter of updating the upgrading our laws uh I'm gonna say upgrade
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.440]   upgrading a loss to sort of match technology but but yeah I mean I don't know it feels kind of like a
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.040]   bit like a cop-out right like if you're doing something you don't want people to know about then uh
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.920]   then don't do it electronically I don't know I've been watching I mean rewatching the wire uh I don't
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:54.240]   HBO the HBO series the wire and it's it's a fascinating sort of uh study on how to communicate
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.840]   without getting without getting trapped I say everybody just get pagers and have some sort of a
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   you know scrambled uh a combination that nobody knows and only talk on payphones uh yeah I don't
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   know I think I think it's just it's just an awareness and and and I think people are still
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   sort of learning that you know whatever I put online I have to be aware even if I feel if I think
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.360]   it's private it it might not be that there are lots of ways that it could not be it's such a clear
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.040]   case to me that making laws based on technologies is so wrong and in essence our protections on mail
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.080]   were made to a technology of print and physical delivered and the principle should have been there
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.160]   that we have a right to private personal communication period full stop but it doesn't work that way does
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:45.520]   it it doesn't there are some tools there are some tools for you know digitally encrypting your email
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.160]   that weren't there I have to say that I have an eight-week old so my brain's kind of motion I've
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.280]   only followed the story sort of a little bit but what wasn't wasn't patreus and his mistress
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.880]   aren't weren't they like writing draft emails and saving them in a draft folder and then logging
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.680]   into an account without without sending them I mean that there are sort of this always sort of a
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.240]   little bit of a hacker way to to go around or just try to protect your stuff or to send encrypted
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:16.480]   files but nothing is absolutely and completely secure there's a lot of gmail brand people who
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.880]   weren't sophisticated like you got it are they gonna look and say oh my god gmail's easy to uh
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   do you think this has an impact on them? I don't think I'm safe Denise go ahead I was gonna say I
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   don't think it impacts gmail any worse than any other standard kind of email program it maybe gives
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.760]   rise to an enterprising opportunity for developers to come up with a kind of mail system that they
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:47.200]   could market as you know more secure hushmail is out there what is their tiger mail as well
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:54.880]   um but you know those things just don't seem to get much traction except for people really hardcore
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.720]   interested in security and I think that there's there's an opening for the general public to
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:07.040]   have some sense of yes this is a more private way to go and it's also got all the convenience that I
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:14.400]   love well I didn't plan it this way but I cannot imagine a better segue to our first sponsor
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:22.160]   stamps.com over to you Leo. I might like to interrupt for just a moment to talk about
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:29.040]   this intermediating the post office I got my u.s. postal service mug here
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:35.600]   but I'm gonna talk about stamps.com actually the postal service loves stamps.com because
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.840]   stamps.com means you can do everything you need to do uh at your desk instead of going to the
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:48.720]   post office I mean everything print uh legal u.s. postage and by the way you do not need a postage
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.960]   meter or special ink you're gonna save up to 80 percent off what you're paying on a postage

[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:25.040]   stuff but but I think the fascinating me this week in the world of video was the mozzilla released
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:31.840]   what they call popcorn maker 1.0 which is an online video editing platform that uh lets you
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:38.640]   take a video online and then add all kinds of events and things to them so just for background
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.480]   chat do you want to pledge to a few a little bit of the demo piece.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:52.080]   Mine. It also played for me sorry I thought I was gonna be smooth. There we go.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.880]   And it says press play there's a popcorn maker lets you enhance video and audio you find on the
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.840]   web by layering in your favorite web services and then sharing these remixes with the world
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.560]   the first thing you'll notice in the popcorn maker interface is the video itself look at me
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.040]   now imagine this video is something you've imported from the web videos of the news your
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.920]   favorite performers your favorite show or just your favorite cat the most important feature of
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.040]   popcorn maker is the event editor by dragging one of these events either onto the video or onto
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.240]   the timeline you'll create a new event here's what an event for a piece of text looks like on the
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:34.560]   timeline imagine we're creating a newscast here's a pop-up here's an image here's a Wikipedia
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.720]   article about Africa here's a map of Africa get it the position of the event on the timeline
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.360]   indicates when it will appear in the video area you can drag these events anywhere on the video
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.440]   as well as resize them to fit your composition I want you to try this now I've put a pause event
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.400]   on the timeline that will stop this tutorial while it's paused drag an event onto the timeline and
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.040]   when you're done press play to continue so we want to do this much longer but just drag something on
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:12.320]   chat for a second so yeah I dragged on a twitter um node and so I can do a search or username so
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:27.280]   let's say um jeff jorovis and click away and there we go now we have all of jeff's tweets in the video
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:34.080]   and some things that I can do with this are come down here to the timeline and drag it to make it
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:43.360]   longer make it shorter so it's really fast I can also resize the actually I believe twitter is kind
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.800]   of stuck in this size but I can move it around or whatever I want and that's just twitter there are
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.560]   a whole bunch of events like text pop-up google maps um twitter images you can do a loop or a
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.280]   skip or a pause or even a Wikipedia article so I was enthralled with this uh a that it came from
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.200]   mozilla which is mozilla getting way out of browsers and email and the and the applications
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:15.360]   we know uh be when they get to things like the chrome book the fact that you can do video editing
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   those kinds of things just through a browser uh I was fascinated am I just video geek what do you
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.560]   guys think oh this is awesome this is a really cool i want to see a twitter so it annotated like
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:33.360]   this yeah oh Chad you just got more work haha so you can do that you can actually change the
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:40.640]   source media so if I wanted to go grab a youtube video so let me open up a new tab go to youtube
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:48.480]   uh dot com slash twitch well this would be fun yeah so let's let's check out how to um i'm going
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.880]   to go to of course this week in google and i'll choose the the latest episode
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:02.960]   math wins and we can grab the url from the top and then throw it into the source video area
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.680]   apply it and now denta-dun
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   it will play of course this is probably the long there we are um the longest way you know
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:24.320]   possible video that we could have ever given it um we can annotate all the moments i desperately
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:33.040]   wish that leo was in studio we just put a picture of leo he'll just fly in from time to time totally
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.400]   right and so there's a little pop up about breaking news there's an image that didn't load fast enough
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.760]   but then uh some maps and things like that and then you can links in for we're talking about a link
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.240]   you can put the link in there right right or like say we we talk about ting um let me go to my events
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:58.000]   let's grab uh we could say we could write grab some text or even a wikipedia article about ting
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.720]   let's see um oh it looks like you have to have the article link that it's sort of the the
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:12.080]   wikipedia syntax right yeah i mean um it's it's pretty i mean look here's a picture of a cat
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:19.760]   over the square space pretty amazing um and especially as a video editor myself
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:28.240]   i um looked for this when i reviewed the first chrome book and it's it's a very powerful tool
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:37.360]   for taking a video and then annotating on top of it um and then on top of that once you post this
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:46.400]   you anyone else can remix the creation um and and it kind of skirts around copyright laws because
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   you're not actually changing the base video the base video is sort of like a background that's
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   always there and then you're layering information on top of it so if so you're not stealing the
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.680]   content and making it your own video it's always sort of these separate pieces that you're creating
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.840]   a collage of instead well unless unless you take this week's episode and you say Jarvis is boring
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.680]   across it uh did he's what is what is what's what's when what do you think along those with this
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:23.200]   thing yeah fabulous fair use tool i you know if you're doing commentary or otherwise um adding to
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.520]   the original uh i think that you know there there's definitely all kinds of opportunities to use
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:36.080]   this in a fair use kind of way um there are probably some people who would look at this and say you
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:42.480]   know depending on what use was made if it wasn't uh commentary if it was some kind of more of a
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:48.640]   derivative work based on the original that just the fact that they've made that one copy and then
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:54.000]   layered things over uh there would probably be something to talk about under copyright law as to
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.440]   why that that might not be okay um i don't know enough technically about how it works uh to really
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.120]   parse that but um but it really plays with with the whole notion of a remix and your right fair
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:14.880]   comment that that if you make a comment directly on that piece it's like it's like being able to
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:21.680]   scroll over you know a column you don't agree with in the New York Times nonsense right what happens
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.120]   to this video once you're done can you can you export it does it live on this the popcorn does
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.280]   it live on the on this the mozzilla site what what happens to it so no you you can't ever download
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.000]   the the finished product and that's one of the reasons why i think that this sort of goes around
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.720]   um copyright claims is that you can only watch it when it is streamed um through a embedded
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:54.800]   sort of situation um and and so it is my belief that if the original video creator were to take
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.000]   their video off of youtube you could no longer play this video because it's going it's pulling
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.960]   it directly right right because you because it affects we hold linking everything yeah absolutely
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:12.400]   but the hitler the amazing hitler video right this could be the tool to make the new captions
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.240]   for the hitler video right right but the other thing is you know you could unupload it but you
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.040]   could screem record it you could always render this thing through you know through through analog means
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.240]   or or fake analog means you can you could you could take the output of this and feed it into a
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.080]   compressor and then have a rendered version that that's doable they just don't make that easy at
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.480]   the moment because they're trying to encourage the the hot linking stuff and the you know and the
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.320]   problem is you can make something with this but then it says fragile as a web page in that if any
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.960]   of the things you've hot linked go away you get a sort of empty box there instead i'm not quite
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.280]   sure if i link to a search on twitter for jeff javis will i get um the current search for on twitter
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.080]   for jeff javis where i get the one that i made at the time which you know and will have expired
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.440]   by the time you play it next week so there's there's there's some trickiness about um attaching to
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.480]   to live web assets but that's you know it's it's still a very interesting and powerful tool and
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.080]   hopefully the answer to that will will be better caching and and and ability to sort of link to
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:19.600]   things at a particular point in time i thought it was amazing and i was also interested in in
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:26.880]   mozilla doing this why do we think they did this well it you know it's it's they've got a little
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:32.320]   conge s that was designed to let you do dynamic web stuff and this is an example for that um and
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.560]   they're interested in this because their agenda is keeping the web open and and
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.760]   have given you access to it and so they they want to make sure this stuff isn't locked up in
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.600]   proprietary silos but can be done as part of the web so doing it in a way that requires you to
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:54.320]   link everywhere is is very much in line with their values so chad you do have new work right
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.200]   right and so as whenever whenever we mention your twitter account i'll have to show the live feed
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:05.760]   of what you just tweeted it that seems like a job in the chat room actually yeah yeah in
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.440]   anyone can do this yeah well the other thing would be to take the the ioc record of the chat
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.640]   room and feed it through this so you get an automated one because the chat room is throwing
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.960]   up links and stuff and commentary that we don't always get to so you could have a little like
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.600]   running here's some extra stuff that you might want to click on as you watch this
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.080]   like you know web 696 just sent us a youtube to xbox 360 answer to do our question earlier there
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:34.240]   we go yes yes but yes we were talking earlier about uh about youtube to to smart tv's and to
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.600]   xbox 360 and that is possible uh you have to pair the device so what we talked about earlier the
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.320]   airplay feature which is just send your google tv is a one-tap thing but you can currently pair
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:51.040]   your android device with smart tv's and tivo and xbox 360 thank you very very much web 6960
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.560]   uh for the link
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:00.240]   so i was fascinated by that um i'm jumping on a job all over the map and you guys could just you
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.000]   know there's no such thing as a host with me here uh i jumped in with anything who put up the link
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.440]   to the neantic project neantic project this is actually me that was you um that's that's that's
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:17.120]   that's the i found it i found it fascinating because it's the uh uh oh hell no i can't get it
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.800]   uh who is it it won't go like we'll go up uh because somebody can you look at it quickly
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.280]   yeah let me uh i forget where i put that um it's under google oh good good yes so so this is it
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:37.120]   seems like it's a it's a project that that google is keeping um semi-secret it it looks like a
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:43.840]   well the first outcome of it is the is that is that thing neat things around you out right what's
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.160]   it called uh sorry field trip right field trip thank you so this is an employee uh john
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.400]   he i guess it is there right who wanted to leave and start this company and he was talked into
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:01.840]   stain by larry and the first thing that came out was uh was field trip and part of his argument was
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:08.160]   as i as i read the story uh that he was disturbed and people were just down in their in their screens
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.320]   just doing that all the time so he wanted to reason that look up and so field trip tells you
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.040]   what's around you and has you look around uh what do we think it was up to this one
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:25.120]   i well i think it's it's part of the information as you as you move around things and this is this is
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:31.520]   the um you know eric's trousers discussion of like your phone suggesting things as you as you go past
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.760]   them and this is an iteration of that so it's um trying to say um here's you know here's some
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.240]   stuff you might want to look at nearby now i i turned this on last week and i was in in las vega
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.040]   for a for a company meeting and it was going mad and it was firing off every eight seconds because
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.200]   there's so many like tourist attraction things around there that i couldn't you know i was like
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.360]   will you stop doing that whereas if i try and run it here in in suburban san jose it goes oh well
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.560]   there's sort of a park over there maybe so they've got some stuff to work with about what it triggers
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.960]   for and when and then some settings for that but the idea is nice the the idea of this sort of
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.560]   there's some something serendipitous nearby to you that um that you might want to look at is
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.120]   interesting and i think that makes some sense um it reminds me also of of findery which is um
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.240]   katarina fakes new thing which is encouraging people to put interesting markers on the map and
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:26.480]   explain why they matter um so so using the earth as a as a means of communication so there's as
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.640]   you've got different places on the on the earth there are stories to be told about that there's
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.120]   history there's things you can look up there this is a way of discovering that but doing it as you
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:42.960]   move through the earth i mean it's got google glass written all over it yeah right i mean every
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.800]   single time i see any of these apps that are just like things around you it's like oh clearly this
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.040]   is built for google glass by the way they've been sort of the things have been quiet on the glass
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:58.640]   front uh recently but aren't they shipping glass to the google i/o attendees was it january that they
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.800]   said jeff do you know i was just about to ask you when you're gonna get it yeah i think i think it
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   is january isn't it yeah i think that they said early early next year so uh yeah i've got my number
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.440]   it's up uh i mean we just haven't heard a whole lot about it recently so yeah i mean whenever i see
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.840]   these it's like oh of course you know this is glass for glass two related stories there's also a google
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.200]   google glass competitor coming out there'll be a few of those we'll see uh where'd that go on the um
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:37.200]   uh leo how do you do this it's not easy isn't it jesus it is not uh somewhere in this
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:43.280]   your rundown uh there's a story about a competitor for google glass it's on the the very bottom of
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:53.120]   other uh how music's music's right so yeah that's tempting but i'm thinking uh but it's not google
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   i guess the hardware doesn't matter right i mean it depends on what operating system it uses and
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.600]   can i use google maps in it and what else the advantage in that picture for those of you who are on audio
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:11.040]   it's more like a cell phone um earpiece with a very very long microphone that comes out to be
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.920]   a screen so you don't have to wear it as glasses anymore you wear it on your ear which is pretty cool
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.680]   very star trek i think google glasses more data this is more communicator
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.160]   this looks like a bluetooth headset a really long bluetooth headset with a stick on it yeah with
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.000]   the stick on it yeah yeah it's a stick for your mouth it's a stick for your eye yeah yeah i mean i think
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.280]   the opportunity is like somebody could make glasses that look better than google's version
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:49.760]   but these are not it in my opinion but you know last you've served too you gotta admit that yeah
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:56.320]   they do they do yeah absolutely but i was just thinking like if if you could buy a pair that had
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.280]   maybe software that wasn't as good as googles but were that were less conspicuous or look nicer
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.640]   wouldn't you buy those over the google version that had the great software like i wonder if vanity
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.560]   is going to be the most is that is going to be the biggest issue for for glass i can't wait for
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.800]   the you put your google glasses on on their show oh we neither
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:24.880]   it's going to be fun in our world vanity decrees that you wear them all the time they'll be they'll
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.960]   be beautiful being magnificent as long as i can push them up on my head when i don't need them
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:37.520]   it's what i always do with my glasses so the thing that's that's that's um striking about these is
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.000]   that it isn't you know it's an extra prosthetic like having an earbud like having something whisper
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.440]   in your ear but from what i've seen of the google glass it's you can's it's not you know you can
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.000]   just look up and glance it and then look back um but i can see that that would be very um
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.040]   awkward for other people watching you but we're gonna get used to it the thing is it's the point
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.520]   is is less intrusive than doing that which is what we do at the moment you know we're walking around
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.000]   i was doing it i was doing a service in vegas i was in vegas on election night so i was walking down
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.680]   the vegas strip with this in my hand reading the election results and trying not to bump into
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.600]   people as i went from one hotel to another um and i realized it was actually quite good because
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.040]   it meant people were sock-handing the little cards for the strippers and things um but it was it was
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.480]   i was surprised by how practical it was as a way to sort of do two things at once so i can sort of
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.680]   see the you know i was i was sitting there watching twitter go by and the npr election results
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:36.560]   all that stuff as i walked over to see um pull cars crew um nsw fw who were covering the election
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.960]   in their hotel um so when i got there i was up to date on what was going on and didn't have to say
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.320]   oh what so what's happened in the meantime um because it was right you know it was right about
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.440]   the time when all the results were coming in um and that was that was interesting in that it was um
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.160]   you know it's it's the it's apparently information thing that we all do and we're sort of used to
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.480]   doing it with our phones um be able to do it in a less intrusive way with a little thing in the
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.080]   corner of your eye maybe maybe a good thing in in in the future but it also dangerous too Kevin
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.560]   right that you can um still bump into things because your eye is just concentrating on something else
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.920]   oh yeah yeah no i mean and it's you know there's the same problem as as texting while driving
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.520]   it's if there's another screen there and it's actually taking a big chunk of your attention
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.840]   you've got to be careful what you're doing so yeah there's that you you you you end up if you get
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.320]   drawn into that it was the same thing as you know we're doing this show and somebody clicks a link
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.680]   and they'll go off and read it and then you want to say and what do you think Kevin is like oh crap
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.360]   what am i supposed to think um because you we think we can multitask more than we actually can
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.080]   that's true there's also the argument of course that it's rude to be looking at your phone
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.240]   in a conversation but the other truth is the conversation you're having in the phone maybe
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.600]   better than the one you're having in person who's to say that being in person is necessarily better
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:56.080]   except when the internet goes out you're not there in the studio at twig how we do a chat
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:03.360]   and doing good um that was a really weird uh we had a weird bug where everyone dropped off
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.120]   except for Kevin at the same time i'm still trying to get Denise back that was wacky that was really
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:15.920]   wacky yeah it's crazy oh technology well i i'm the closest i suppose well Chad would this be a good
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.720]   time to go off and and hear from our next sponsor american express yeah that sounds great Leo what
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:26.960]   do you got for us folks we uh interrupt this program for a word from american express

[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.600]   all anxious to save more is one of the one of the things that uh everybody says if americans
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.720]   or just save more money be good for the economy and good for them you know say whether it's saving up
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.920]   for your ford or a new home or just a rainy day it's important to save and you want to get the best
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:58.800]   return for your money and that's why i wanted to tell you about the american express bank fsp member

[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:11.520]   savings American Express bank FSB member FDIC thank you so much for supporting this week
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:18.320]   in Google we continue now with Jeff Gina and the gang back to you he's so smooth and that's so
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.640]   hard to do so many of those before he went off the vacation was the price he paid the thank you
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.600]   so while we're on this idea of of connectivity there was one of the story that fascinated me
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.760]   that's somewhat related in the rundown that a French cellular company called SING Fox is created
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:39.360]   network just to connect physical things so bathroom scales and lights and sensors and all that kind
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.200]   of stuff I found that really interesting because we've talked about that a lot the internet of
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:49.440]   things the connected world the web of things but it doesn't have to be a 4g network to connect
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.400]   your dishwasher right it doesn't have to be that and so it becomes a special purpose cell network
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:01.120]   which I imagine can use excess capacity on lower cost networks if I write a wrong here to connect
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.280]   millions of things and what that reveals why don't you guys think of that
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:13.760]   I'm somewhat suspicious I mean there's you know there's a we've got a bunch of these there's
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.440]   Zigbee and a bunch of these other like local area network bits and pieces and the challenge is always
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:25.280]   getting enough devices on it and actually Wi-Fi is pretty pervasive that the problem is we end
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:30.080]   up locking it all up too much so you end up with the stupid challenge of I have a device you know
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.520]   like the the Nexus Q is an example I have a device I want to get on the Wi-Fi network
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.120]   but it doesn't have a screen so I have to whack it over the head with a thing that has a screen so
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.680]   I could type in a password whereas if we if we use Wi-Fi the way we originally designed it
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.400]   you can find anything nearby and connect to that and assume that that's that's the right thing to do
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.720]   so we have a lot of you know good pervasive wireless stuff going on in the in the Wi-Fi world but
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:58.160]   people are reinventing new things to go on top of it or find trying find you where to sell us
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.040]   yet another cellular contract and that you know that I find a little frustrating
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:07.840]   an app I have been using is Open Garden I don't know if you guys have seen that
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:14.480]   this is it creates a distributed network using either Wi-Fi direct or Bluetooth
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.280]   between a set of devices that you have and if anyone any one of them has connectivity it shares
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.800]   it with the others and I was using that when I said I was walking down the street in Vegas
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.760]   obviously there is a Wi-Fi down the street in Vegas but my phone was connected and the Open Garden
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.240]   thing was connected between the two so in that sort of person area network thing that works quite
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.400]   well I haven't had as much success for it on the on the laptop but for a bunch of different
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.960]   Android devices one of which has connectivity it works pretty well hold on there explain it to me
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:54.880]   is it is it not a hotspot it's not a hotspot it's it's basically scavenging so if I
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.480]   let me see if I can set this up I'll turn off turn off Wi-Fi and one of them
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:05.440]   what it does is you sort of connect your devices together it's using Bluetooth
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:11.040]   chips that were not the Bluetooth protocols because it doesn't do the annoying pairing
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:17.920]   bullshit the the Bluetooth does so if I let me see let me turn off Wi-Fi on here
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.800]   this is what is what I should prep this demo okay so I turn Wi-Fi off on this one
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:36.400]   and then connect to Open Garden and I say so I say connect
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:43.920]   and I've now both of them got both them saying connect the Nexus 7 is not currently connected to
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:50.560]   the net the galaxy Nexus here is and after a little while it goes oh we found each other
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.720]   you're connected because it should do I've got Bluetooth turned on so there's a little bit of
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.520]   buggling around the first time you use it as they try to find each other and then once that's done
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.080]   they stay connected so I think because I software update both of these it may have lost its its
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.840]   settings for a bit but then what happens is if either of them have connectivity for whatever
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.400]   reason the other one can pick it up as long as they're close enough and it's using as I said
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:23.440]   it's using Bluetooth and it's using Wi-Fi direct so then what what can you do what's the point
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.840]   the point is you then have connectivity where you didn't have it so the so the
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.600]   oh I see you're sharing an internet connection yes but it's not
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.560]   it's not as heavy weight as doing the Wi-Fi sharing on the on the phone which tends to
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   tighten all the way it was on your device and drain the battery really quickly this is just
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:46.160]   doing it sort of in the background and and scavenging but also once they're actually connected
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:53.120]   the the they realize that they're paired and they don't lose it again and you don't have all the
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.640]   bullshit with Bluetooth where it's like oh have I got you have an all got you right right right
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.840]   it's actually actually it has worked out quite well and realizing these devices should be
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.680]   part of the same network and I suspect we're gonna you know we're gonna see more of this stuff
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:12.640]   a lot of these mesh network ideas have been around for quite a while but they sort of failed on
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.840]   density of devices right and as we start having more of these gadgets lying around all over the
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.080]   place that's that's going to become less of an issue but that's not what is french thing and the
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.800]   french thing is that that you would have a cellular antenna in all these devices in your scale and
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.680]   your washing machine or whatever right and rather than going through Wi-Fi they're saying that
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:38.400]   whereas a cellular connection consumes 5,000 microwatts a two-way connection device devices 100
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:43.520]   so they say they can cover france and area larger than california using just 1,000 antennas
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.840]   so instead of the assumption that we had which is all these devices are going to go into Wi-Fi and
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:54.320]   all that if if devices came with very light cellular antennas and could go through a cellular
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:00.720]   network and had an addressable had an address a phone number basically right or anywhere
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:08.480]   or roof you know that seems to be possible jina it seems to me that that there's a developer
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:14.400]   if you really could address 20 things in your home you could invent all kinds of new things no
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:20.320]   i you know i'm usually like bullish about new kinds of technologies but it's weird with this
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.440]   with the internet of things uh i'm a little bit like get off my lawn because i i don't think i
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.480]   i don't think i fully see what what you can do like i like why would i want my microwave connected
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:36.000]   to the to the internet um i mean i guess i see some examples you know turning my lights on before i
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.360]   get home at night or you know they they they turning on the heat or the cooling that kind of thing
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.640]   if i had a dog i mean i've seen really cool projects with little you know dog doors being
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:52.160]   programmed or whatever i backed a project on kickstarter called uh what's it called smart things
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.560]   which is little sensors for different for different things in your house but i and i know that you
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.080]   know as a developer i should just be like you know lit a flame by all the possibility but it
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:06.480]   this might be because i'm just getting old i just kind of feel like it would add a layer of
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:12.160]   complexity for maybe not that much payoff i mean jeff what is there something that you're dying to
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.360]   do with you know an inanimate object in your in your house that you could do if it were connected
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:21.600]   i think there's a few ways to look at this one is the individual level yeah if my if my oven
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:29.440]   could download a new program to do the perfect turkey um okay okay the guy because my hair
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.040]   we were out of power the guy because my hair was absolutely delighted that he managed to put his
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.520]   turkey in foil at all of the freezer was gonna go bad and do it on the fireplace so he really
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:42.240]   happy so it's the opposite of the world but if i get if i can download data into certain appliances
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.280]   that's one way to look at it the other way to look at it that excites me is tons and tons and tons of
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:54.160]   sensors that know stuff that share that stuff and that data um and and we're seeing all kinds of
[00:59:54.160 --> 01:00:00.320]   kickstarter apps that that that are doing this with with small and very cheap sensors uh that are
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.520]   now going Wi-Fi but could also go through other means they you know that if you had uh outside in
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:12.560]   new york sound sensors all over you would have a sense uh through data analysis of how much traffic
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.600]   there is um you'd have a sense of where something bad happens somewhere uh in a new idea uh if you
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:28.400]   had sensors all around new jersey that with um uh you you could know which houses had power on for
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.160]   example we can have a people's network of that because believe me the utilities here have been
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.280]   just awful especially in lon island especially life but it's just been terrible uh and there's
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.720]   data that they don't give to us we don't know anything well we could suddenly start to get a
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:50.400]   sense network of who has power and who doesn't um we could um uh get a sense network of of of
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.480]   more weather things i don't know it just it just strikes me that there's there's possibilities for
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.520]   data that we just don't know and if we can connect all these things via cell that means they don't
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.280]   have to be near a Wi-Fi they don't have to have the passwords they have a way to address right well
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.640]   for devices that you don't need to update all the time that you'd like to work a really long time
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.160]   i could see this being very good for conserving those devices making sure that they're getting
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.200]   whatever updates they need a la the chrome books that automatically update themselves
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:29.760]   uh we had a washing machine that had a very high tech um lcd display uh you know basically
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:36.000]   had a computer brain in it but when that thing failed because it was not communicating with
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.760]   anything because it was standalone the tech who came out to fix it said well you know it'll cost us
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.320]   600 dollars to go in and monkey around with this thing and see if it can be salvaged you may as
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:54.560]   well go out and buy a new washer so right that's another right is that uh if you had and this
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.760]   come out of a Wi-Fi too but if you have some more appliances that don't need to be on all the time
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.400]   they could go on when the power grid tells them to go on and you end up with a much smarter grid
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.440]   right well but it still ends up being are you building a you know a centralized network
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.760]   decentralized one i mean the thing is you know you can do this with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi it was built to do
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.880]   this and then we imposed all this password bullshit on it it was born free and is everywhere in chains
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:26.560]   now what i think could be interesting for this is at if we have um more open spectrum like the
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.880]   Wi-Fi bands like the white space and stuff we talked about you reusing the old tv bands
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:36.400]   you'll be able to do more experimental networks like this without having to buy spectrum licenses
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.560]   one of the reasons why if i work so well is it is the same band everywhere in the world
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.200]   which means you can carry a device around and have it work anywhere whereas all the cellular
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.600]   networks you you there there's variation between countries one of the big problems they had with
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:55.280]   the nexus four was that they couldn't they didn't put an LTE radio in it for the u.s because that
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.240]   was a different frequency from the ones in europe and so on and so you end up having to in the u.s
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.880]   particularly you know having to build specific models for each specific carrier because they're
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:10.160]   they're using both different encodings and different frequencies whereas the the Wi-Fi stuff
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.720]   we ended up with a chunk of bandwidth that was the same everywhere and in a protocol that was agreed
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.240]   that was the same everywhere and we've we've broken that we've we've threw paranoia about people
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.640]   using your network and things like that we've imposed passwords and um bullshit man in the
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.920]   middle of things that make you type stuff into the web first don't get don't get them uh with it with
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:43.840]   it with a with a red mark bs hmm uh bad words on youtube oh sorry oh yes we have all that bs
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.800]   on top of Wi-Fi now and it's broken that's why i just wonder whether a cell network because it has
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:55.680]   a different structure that has a number but yeah okay i i got um it's new technology on it that's all
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:01.120]   well there's um you know there's the there's the campaign to reopen Wi-Fi then if you saw it and
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:08.880]   if you guys cover that it's like no it's like you did like the computer well i'm sorry you cover the
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:17.360]   campaign to reopen Wi-Fi last week uh no i don't think we did let me see if i can find the name of it
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.560]   you know i have someone buzzing in kevin from the sky above yeah there's there is a plane
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.720]   go over sorry about that i've also got a poodle who seems to come out of the house um
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:40.880]   so the open wireless movement open wireless.org um is a campaign by um the eff the internet archive
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:47.200]   and lots of other nice people um to say um why don't you open your Wi-Fi networks things
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:55.360]   aren't so bad and find ways of doing this that aren't as um awkward as giving a word access to
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.560]   everything and then it comes down to we've been scared because oh people can get onto your network
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:07.040]   but this is actually a flawed worldview of wireless security this is the failed firewall model
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.920]   where you assume that inside the network everything is is lovely and outside the network there are
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.680]   enemies and therefore the boundary of the network is the thing you need to worry about and actually
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.200]   this isn't true um each of the devices are connected to everything else and you need to you need to
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.520]   actually have security on each device and use secure connections when you need to then it doesn't
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.640]   matter what what the network looks like so um the point of point of this is to encourage you to
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:38.400]   set up an open Wi-Fi network whose name is open wireless.org um without a password and many of the
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.720]   routers that you buy including all the apple ones will let you set up more than one wireless network
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.600]   a closed a passwordy one and an open one and balanced traffic between them and so they're
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.960]   encouraging you to do this um so that you can actually people can can roam onto Wi-Fi in different
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.440]   places I think I think this is this is a really good idea um I think it's um you know it would be
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.640]   it's something when when parts of New York had connectivity some didn't there was still the
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.680]   problem that you could you could walk around town and see Wi-Fi networks and not be able to connect
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:14.400]   to them because they everyone's locked them all down now um and having that kind of um availability
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.440]   of this is a public resource I think is extremely valuable. Gene did you think there's any hope that
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.320]   anybody's gonna do that or is another one of those uh goody-two-shoes things that ought to happen
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.000]   and nobody's gonna listen? I mean I hope so you know it's funny you know we were right on life
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.040]   hacker a lot about how to secure your stuff because you know you hear these cases about people you
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.320]   know park outside your house and use your your wireless network to to do a legal thing you know
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.600]   download music or to copyright a music or to download porn or whatever and that you would take the
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:51.200]   take the hit for that because it was your connection um I mean I like the idea this is an organized
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   movement and that there's a you know that there's this standard network name which is pretty cool
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.160]   and I like that they're you know that they're encouraging you to use the guest
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.800]   guest network functionality of your router which I've actually never used I'll do this
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.480]   but yes I do think this is the kind of thing that Geeks will will will take will take
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.880]   excuse me will take and run with and maybe not maybe not normal people but then then again
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.640]   given which just happened in New York uh this is you know all the more reason for people to
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.800]   share resources and and this is one way to do it and it wasn't just uh you know electricity
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.200]   which was vital but also you know trying to get a mifi though we were lucky again in hotel but the
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.280]   hotel had no internet and so there were mifi scattered all around but they were working that well
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:42.480]   uh and that was an issue so but this is we have an easier answer be a question counselor um
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   what's the what when I go to I go to I go to Starbucks again and again and again and I have to
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.320]   constantly sign on and agree to the checkbox for signing on to the god bless it this very nice
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.080]   something to give me a free network but it's the pain and my devices can't do it and I want to
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.920]   get my email and it tries to hook into the wi-fi and it stops me from checking my email until I
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.400]   go off and do that or turn off the wi-fi app what are they afraid of why are they having me
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:13.040]   check off that I've agreed not to do whatever I've agreed not to do oh gosh um I can think of
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:19.200]   lots of reasons why they're oh no I was afraid you know they don't want you being able to come
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.640]   after them for some sort of shortcoming uh of the wi-fi service they're providing they don't want to
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:32.160]   be held responsible for anything you may do while using their network um those are two biggies okay
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.680]   okay that's that's that's but that's at all with all respect that's kind of the legalese of oh my
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:41.440]   god things could happen what could be really what could I really would can we imagine a doomsday
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.360]   scenario for the Starbucks network well what was the thing with the sheep
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.840]   you know you know fire she yes fire sheep
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.240]   but would that be without the Starbucks or that was real
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.200]   well that was what let me let me talk about fireship you know the point about fireship was that was
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.040]   saying if you're not using secure HTTP anyone can snoop on what's going over the network and that
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.880]   was true and it's still true and it wasn't anything to do with wi-fi particularly it's just it's
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.600]   easier with wi-fi because you're all in the same room with radios um the same if you're if you're
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:21.120]   using HTTP without HTTPS um then anyone who's in between you can eavesdrop on the packets and that
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.280]   can be done in many different ways it can be done by being part of the ISP it can be done by putting
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:33.440]   fake roots in and tapping that way it can be done by being you know the the FBI's box at the ISP
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.520]   people can tap into things like that or you know or or it can just be the thing in the coffee
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.080]   shops sniffing every packet as it goes by so the point of fire sheep was to point this out to people
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.760]   and say encourage companies to turn on HTTPS by default and it has been largely successful in that
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:55.280]   if you look at twitter and facebook and google and all the sites that fire sheep targeted they now
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.960]   do default to HTTPS which means that um you've got an encrypted connection between you and their
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:07.360]   server um and you have some sense that it isn't the the you aren't being man-n-n-middle it's not
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.920]   completely safe against that because of some subtleties about how certificates work but
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.880]   broadly you're safe against somebody intercepting you because it'll your your device will tell you
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.040]   that isn't who you think it is when it's HTTPS
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:27.600]   right and back back to your question Jeff you know could could a provider be held responsible
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.120]   um i think they could you know i mean it would be something that people would fight about in
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:42.880]   court but uh you know the standards for for what sort of Wi-Fi is required to be provided under the law
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:49.440]   or um work in progress for sure and there's the problem is that it's broken right and i can't just
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.360]   wander in through a Wi-Fi zone at the Starbucks and say thank you Starbucks thank you AT&T
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.600]   and use it i have to stop and i have to go through McGill I there's no mechanism for me to sign up
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.960]   once and for all and say hello okay i take responsibility all right you know if i sign on
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.000]   your network let me in and i it's my fault well that should be something they they should be able
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   to fix if they can identify you or your device right but the problem is doing that between
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.600]   the Starbucks is um so what they're trying to do with the open wireless.org is instead of having
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.160]   one of these click through contracts of adhesion that you have to go through every time they are
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:33.440]   saying well by calling the the Wi-Fi network open wireless.org um and putting up a sticker on the
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:39.360]   wall or a poster you are saying the terms of use for this are this um that's just as good a contract
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:45.440]   of adhesion as um getting somebody to click something you know it's just as like to stand up in court
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.880]   and and they and obviously you can you can do IP banning or something if you if you find people
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   abusing it so what they're trying to do is like as a sort of creative commons-like thing of
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.720]   defining a standardized license that that um open wireless.org defines that you can just then
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:08.000]   refer to um and they're saying they they hope to um they're they're not saying they will
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.160]   defend you in court but they said they have in the past defended open wireless networks in court
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.640]   and have some case law and they're going to keep trying to do that so that's the there's a you know
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.480]   there's a long sort of here's what we're trying to do disclaimer on the open wireless.org side
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.360]   but they're basically trying to if they try to change the norm such that people say well you have
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.040]   to secure your network and push back against that a bit and I think that's that's a very encouraging
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.280]   thing would be a great thing all right so we're gonna lose Denise in a few minutes so there's one
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.160]   of the story that you put up in the rundown Denise about California workplace laws and privacy and
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.800]   social stuff you want to talk about that for a second and yeah it um it kind of goes back to the
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:52.720]   patreus story we were talking about earlier um we've got kind of a sort of a perfect storm of
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:59.600]   things happening here people definitely are concerned about these privacy issues and at least
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:07.120]   three states now it's California, Illinois and Maryland um have addressed the problem of employers
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.040]   asking people for their uh social networking passwords and you know there were a lot of
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.680]   stories cropping up about that and those three states have said no that can't be a condition of
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.360]   employment or anything you know you just can't do it employers don't ask your employees for that
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.520]   you can't snoop on them that way um so you know we see some movement there responding to people's
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:35.360]   concerns but then on the flip side recently we had a court in it was the supreme court of South
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:44.000]   Carolina uh interpreting the stored communications act in such a way that again it was um getting
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.320]   into someone's email account this time it wasn't the government uh it was a you know just just as
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.840]   bad as the government right the disgruntled ex who wants to dig up dirt on you um they you know
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:04.080]   either guessed or socially engineered someone's password and got into their account the person
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.280]   sued under the stored communications act saying hey you know they have
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:16.560]   had unauthorized access to my uh storage device and uh the court found no no this isn't something
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:22.240]   that the stored communications act actually uh will prevent and there was a big uh debate about
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.960]   what constitutes storage and whether email is storage in today's day and age and of course you
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.960]   know you were talking about cleaning out your inbox we all use it that way um so it's just kind
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:41.600]   of a big mess and and uh i'm not quite sure how it will all resolve itself um from the litigation or
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:48.400]   legislation standpoint but uh people sure aren't happy with the way that their privacy is um
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.920]   exposed in today's day and age. I think it makes perfect sense i mean in Finland you're not allowed
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.400]   employers not even allowed to google employees to find out but i think it's wrong i think that at
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.440]   some point you have bad employees and you have the ability to find out about them the idea of
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.520]   the reference is dead because everyone's afraid of liability of saying anything bad about anyone
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.160]   but that's all a different world then then actually demanding that it's like asking you to
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:22.000]   hand over the keys to your house so i can go snoop on you that's ridiculous. Indeed so uh you know i
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.640]   think it's just a thing that's going to continue to unfold and we're going to see uh lawmakers and
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.760]   courts continue to struggle with it um but you know at this patreus thing is just another way of
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.120]   getting the issue in front of people and and the more that happens uh the more we might see some
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:47.440]   change that makes sense. Well we're about to lose Denise so i want to say thank you very
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.960]   much Denise for adding in here to our leave this week we will continue on after after that uh you
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.600]   what one is uh you want to plug this week in law? This week in law is friday at 11 pacific 1800
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:06.240]   utc uh so definitely tune in we'll uh we'll probably talk about the patreus case again and we've got
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.440]   Larry Downs and jillian york from EFF joining us so that should be a really fun show
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:17.280]   and uh also i have a twit live special up on the twit network that people should check out if
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.880]   you're interested in seeing what happened at on hollywood which is a conference where uh hollywood
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.480]   folks and technologists come together to hopefully not kill one another but uh figure out how they
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.320]   can work together uh uh we covered that on the twit network and i think it just went up so check
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.320]   that out. Thank you very much and Chad why don't we hit the next commercial for our friends at
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.560]   Ford and then we'll come back and we'll do kind of a lightning round of some stories that each of
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.760]   us wants to hit and then uh depart with our tools and tips and such so over to you Chad and over to
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.920]   you Leo. I'm driving in my car. Hey guys let me just briefly mention one of our sponsors if you
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.080]   don't mind we'll get back to you with this week in google and that's Ford Motor Company. I love
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.920]   I'm just I love you saying that. Oh yes our sponsor Ford Motor Company one of the great american
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.400]   companies and i've been i've been watching if you've seen the tv ads lately where they say the Ford
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:16.240]   Focus it's uh like a computer in a car what do they say like driving a computer it's very
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.680]   interesting they really i think Ford really realized that consumer electronics
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:27.680]   and and automotive technology belong together. The problem is until Ford came along with Ford Sync
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.480]   you you really weren't connected to the outside world you were in your car and that was it.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.360]   The issue was how do we connect you with the outside world without being distracting right
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.160]   with and and what Ford did and they did a lot of testing i know this because i i've talked to
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   them about this is they did a lot of research and they found that you have plenty of cognitive
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:52.240]   ability to drive and do something else the the issue is taking your eyes off the road or your
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.960]   hands off the wheel that's what's really dangerous so they created Ford Sync. Basically everything is
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.440]   voice controlled so your hands are on the wheel your eyes are on the road you don't have to look
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.480]   at anything it reads you back any input you need and you talk to the car and i just think it's
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:14.560]   brilliant and it means you can do so many cool things in a Ford. Best of all Ford is now offering
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:21.120]   sync on any every 2012-2013 Ford vehicle in the US including that beautiful 2012 Ford Focus
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:27.760]   Shannon just bought one of those Shannon Moore she loves it go to for.com/technology you can find
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:34.240]   out more about what Sync can do it lets you control your music player completely via voice
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.800]   browse your music collection via genre album artist playlist or song title all with voice commands
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:47.120]   i in fact go to the web page and read the commands it's kind of amazing that all the things you can
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:54.080]   do with sync basically their their goal was to make make it possible to control everything in your car
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.240]   with your voice without looking away from the road without taking your hands off the wheel
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.440]   voice activated control of your media player to even play a link list of music you're in the
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.800]   mood for or you can say play similar music with a voice command and it will it will do that
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:16.720]   almost any device to voice control music whether it's on your smartphone via bluetooth streaming on a
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:27.360]   usb drive on an mp3 player for.com/technology it's just amazing and then there's some really safety
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:35.040]   stuff to find a police station find a hospital call roadside assistance call 911 nearest veterinarian
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:43.760]   aussie just bark did you hear that nearest pet pet hotel i just love it i want you to visit
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.920]   for.com/technology right now learn more about what sync can do and then go to your four dealer and
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:58.320]   test drive forward sync go further and afford for.com/technology we thank them for their support
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.840]   of this week in google and we return you now to twig thanks guys
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:12.320]   back um so uh we're heading toward toward the home run here to no not the home run i'm just such a
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.520]   non-man what do you call it you're heading toward the home plate here home plate
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:23.520]   he's a scientist pathetic um anyway we're heading ahead and slowly there around what is it four or
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:29.680]   five bases you got i don't know um i wanted to mention a few government stories that we have here
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:37.440]   last week i was supposed to be out of the country in bakhu and then Istanbul but sandy kept me here
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.000]   nonetheless i got up at two in the morning in the hotel to do a video conference with the internet
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.920]   governance forum in bakhu and here's the wonderful obvious irony of it the internet there sucked
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.680]   and it cut off the entire presentation halfway through um this is what's going to happen if
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:02.320]   governments run our internet people uh it's going to be a real problem and we see in the stories this
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:08.160]   week a couple things about about government involvement one is that china going into his party
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:14.640]   congress blocked google entirely and then return them uh there i'd block google.com gmail g plus
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:24.240]   google plus maps docs analytics and more um it uh you know just was able to take that away and put
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.480]   it back and what they give if they take it the way and then we also have google releasing its
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.800]   transparency report which shows nothing but a huge increase uh some of it uh attributable to
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   turkey now being on youtube but a huge increase in government censorship requests to google and
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.880]   that's just what google tells us we don't know what happens on some other services so uh just wanted
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:53.280]   to you know have my usual sermon net here of just saying that that i fear uh what's happening
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:22:02.560]   with government control of the net meanwhile uh we also have uh france and germany and brazil
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:12.480]   publishers working with government all trying to cut off google uh um google news and uh not
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:20.000]   allowed pardon me there goes it's dark and i'm pink again um i'm back uh not allowing them to do
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.400]   snippets because they want basically to have a piece of google's taxes and one last piece i
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:31.440]   watched an appalling i thought hearing this week in the uk with google amazon and starbucks about
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.040]   what's so called tax avoidance and it's quite irksome that country companies like these operate in the
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.520]   uk and in countries around the world and pay little taxes because of accounting things but it's
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.680]   it's tax minimization what no one gets is that it's google saying in the end of the day that they
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.960]   have a fiduciary responsibility to minimize taxes maximize profits maximize value for their
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:59.200]   shareholders if you don't like the law change the law and you have a lot of countries now they're
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.600]   trying to look at google and say we want a piece of your pie or i'll spread it cause you big trouble
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.880]   so little uh around the world government and the internet still aren't getting along
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.720]   any reaction to that rant or we can move on to the next story
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:22.080]   ongoing challenge i mean the the i gc thing was was interesting to um see some of the stuff going
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.880]   on there because that was um originally attempt by the itu to rest back control of the internet
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.120]   um and it was good to see that a lot of the government types who were there were actually
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.200]   pushing back against that and fighting for the internet to stay open again now that piece was good
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.640]   um the taxation and financial stuff is always going to be tricky and some of the things that
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:49.360]   the companies do do seem a bit fishy um but you can see why they do them they end up saying okay but
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:53.840]   yeah the things that google does to make sure it doesn't pay tax in lots of the world by moving
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:24:00.560]   money between island and um holland and the dutch entities and whatever else is they do this like
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.840]   elaborate selling um mythical services to other types of sitturies so they don't end up paying
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.440]   corporation tax anywhere um and then they sit there with all his money overseas they can't bring
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.520]   back to the u.s. if they do they'll have to pay tax on it so there's there's a lot of weirdness
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:19.040]   going on in that that field um and i'm not sure what the answer is to solve that i mean the u.s
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.720]   solved it for individuals by saying well we'll tax you wherever you are in the world so screw
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.280]   you if you're american you if you go to france will tax you would tax you twice um but they haven't
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.200]   done that with corporations yet and if they did that might make it a lot trickier for them well
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.520]   but the problem is that the issue there is not with google with a corporation the issue there is
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.680]   government to government and and they all want their slices to buy and they all don't want to
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.520]   give up their incentives to have companies do business there and sort of somewhere else
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.640]   and uh so you see google you know called on the carbon i really i don't i like defending google
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.520]   all the time i'd rather criticize google it gives me more credibility but it was a rather ridiculous
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.880]   display i thought i'm trying to make google into an enemy and just say that this is immoral
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.960]   when they're following the law that the MPs who criticize them are roped
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.360]   yeah this is the dutch sandwich on the irish double irish that we're talking about i mean
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.240]   this is bigger than google right this isn't lots of companies do this right i mean this is an issue
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.600]   the taxation issue is it happens to have lots of companies right this is in google specific
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.240]   but they go after google because google is such an easy target right that's that's the
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:32.720]   thing that gets me my dander up uh that uh you know google's the big bad american company and um
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:41.280]   one of the things that the head of his name is britain ironically i think of of operations in
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:48.640]   northern europe as he called it the wet wet countries um said in the end i wish the google he was
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.120]   british she said i wish google were british company i wish larry went to cambridge but it isn't and he
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.720]   didn't and uh it's an american company and the real value of of google is in america
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:06.560]   right right do you feel like google being what are the things that google can do something about so
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.960]   so that's a government the government issue do you think that google being issuing their transparency
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.040]   reports about government requests that's that i think again not to pack google in the back but
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.920]   that's that's a good thing right what what else can they do
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:25.680]   to deal with these kind of issues yeah it's good i think the poor transparency about about what it
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.640]   is google has knowledge around the earth and and um really it's probably not google's job it's a
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.400]   journalist job to explain it samely the tax structure that goes on around the world that does in fact
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.960]   have google play pay very low taxes in the uk and i understand why people emotionally are upset about
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.880]   that but what they don't understand is google's fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders that's
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   the way we're set up it's the structure and what do you expect them to do to voluntarily pay more
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.400]   taxes uh then their shareholders would sue them so it's really kind of a journalistic story i think
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:03.920]   um but i i like that idea jina in that google stands in a position to compare things around the
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.960]   world they could they could probably compare you know what companies pay and taxes and things like
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:16.720]   that around the world you're other uncomfortable for them but transparency yeah even i don't expect
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.040]   them to pay voluntarily pay more taxes that seems crazy i mean i'm generally pretty nice and think
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.800]   that google should go out of its way to to to do the right thing but paying more voluntarily paying
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.160]   more taxes seems an insane thing to expect from a company that like you said has a responsibility
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.480]   to maximize profits and this is all legal what they're doing the same with bit robin
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:43.680]   yeah as the robin thing again yeah that yes you know he he was only paying 13% tax or whatever it was
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.200]   and then the argument becomes well okay that was legal but wasn't nice um and that will that this
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.920]   that's what's happening uk i think they've actually looked at um how much tax big companies are paying
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.160]   Starbucks i think was the one that they they made the most um case for because they're actually
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.840]   got a lot of employees in the country it's not like it's a virtual company that could be anywhere
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.280]   they're actually selling coffee but they were still doing some kind of shenanigans to make sure
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:13.680]   they didn't end up paying any tax they were paying 20% cost to for for um brand and other services to
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:20.400]   a subsidiary i think in Netherlands or somewhere like that uh but but even so part of the argument
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.480]   that made by a defender of Starbucks and i don't know the Starbucks and Amazon stories well enough
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.520]   but uh Starbucks is investing in more and more and more stores in the uk employing more and more
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.960]   people paying payroll taxes for them and the argument there is the net is good for them we should
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:46.400]   have this week in taxes which would be a very boring show even worse than ever but it does end up
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   with with the demonization constantly of the of the big technology company now and there's there's
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:59.680]   there's ancillary danger in that i think so well there's part of this is that is the tension between
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:05.520]   the the nets inherent global nature and local laws and that's playing out in lots of different
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:12.640]   respects so the you know the ITU um transfer fees that were negotiated for for phone companies that
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.920]   that helped subsidize state telcos was part of the the rant of the IGF thing um and there you know
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.840]   the similar things with territoriality in rights distributions and things like that um the discussion
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:32.080]   that um uh Corey Dr. O has been promoting about the problems of selling ebooks because the history
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.640]   was if you don't have rights in that territory anyone can sell in it and ebooks has reversed that
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.400]   so therefore suddenly you can't buy English language books in non-English speaking countries
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.600]   in that when they're ebooks um so there's a whole bunch of this stuff that is we're trying to go
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.120]   from stuff that is inherently territorially focused and naturally bounded by geography
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:55.680]   to stuff that is not that is naturally connected to the to the entire world because that's how
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.120]   the internet was designed and the the sort of boundaries between the two are very very messy
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:06.720]   you know being sorted out the moment i wish this is going to go on for a while um and it's you know
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.960]   it's back and forth between the two of them as to as to which is valuable but you know obviously
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:17.840]   my biases is towards the um you know the the global nature of the net and finding new ways of
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:22.080]   dealing with it yes but i'm going to see the opposite perspective from the from the country
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.280]   is going wait a minute why is why have these companies suddenly become immune to being taxed
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:33.200]   uh right but i think what it does is it shows how the net challenges the very essence and existence
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   of governments and that is highly disruptive and governments are going to fight that and it goes
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.000]   back to i think we have to defend constantly defend technology against its demonization
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.280]   by people who are threatened by it or disrupted by it uh all right so we've got about 10 minutes
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.400]   left uh why don't we do around robin and leo to start this before i thought it was fun of just
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.880]   doing the stories that we want to do on the rundown anywhere any what uh why don't you start jina
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.600]   yeah sure um this is i didn't include this in the changelog because it was kind of developer
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:08.800]   heavy but i wanted to mention it google introduces a six-month trial for cloud sequel which is their
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.920]   google app engine uh database section that they're upping the storage to a hundred gigabytes so you
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.360]   get a three six-month trial a hundred gigabytes of storage and a my sequel database uh this sounds
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.160]   really developer heavy but i've got kind of my tongue hanging out here because i feel like google
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:30.320]   app engine is an opportunity for google to uh to to let users or i mean right now it's for developers
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.360]   service for developers but i would love to see it to be a consumer product where people can deploy
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.640]   their own web apps their own server side web apps into their kind of personal cloud right and that's
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.440]   kind of what we do to think up think up is is web app i build it's php my sequel unfortunately so
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.760]   i'm not i'm you can't actually deploy it on google app engine whose google app engine only supports
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:54.320]   python and java at the moment and there's some crazy hacky way to get php to work with the job
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:59.680]   with java but i haven't i haven't actually done that yet uh but this is a hundred gigabytes of of
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.960]   my sequel storage which is pretty amazing super fast reads and writes and uh i don't know kevin have
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.560]   you have you played around with uh have you done much with google app engine i think the last bit
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:15.200]   of dev work i did with app engine was was a google wave bot back in the day it deployed it on app engine
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.760]   and haven't done anything since um i i have done i have just done stuff with it in the past
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   haven't done stuff much stuff recently um and obviously i should say i have an interest here i work
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.400]   for sales force that owns haroku and so we have our own um cloud hosting stuff that that um is
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.840]   is more generous about what it lets you host us bring that way um i think this is this is always
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.000]   interesting i think we i agree with you we had a conversation about this um when we were driving
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.360]   up to twig about the difficulty of being able to deploy something into somebody else's um cloud
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:50.480]   and whether that's that's still fairly painful there is still be able to there are sort of close
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:57.680]   business solution with force.com you could do this that's where you can say okay i want to deploy
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.760]   this thing this app in my domain but it's quite hard to do it as a consumer to say i would like
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.240]   to deploy this thing somewhere and what's happened is the hosting companies have as you say standardized
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.800]   on you know PHP and MySQL um but that doesn't you know that those aren't necessarily the most
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:19.440]   secure things to deploy in the world and and um i think that map bit of said this week says that
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.840]   the price of a self-hosted WordPress installed is eternal vigilance you you're always sitting there
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.320]   trying to find about where the leaks are and what's gone wrong this week so that the challenge is to
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.760]   come up with a way of saying yes i'd like to deploy this thing um and have your own instance of it
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.920]   running in the in the cloud somewhere so that's that's something that you know all of us who are
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:42.480]   doing this cloud services would like to do but it's it's still not straightforward. Is it an
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:49.520]   model for that i mean jina my dream is that is that is that you know amazon google wherever i can
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:56.240]   put up a module and say yes give me my own cloud-based instance of thiccup and when you need to put
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   out an update for security update just like an android app it just pushes out and i can keep using
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.200]   it happily and paying you or whatever i don't understand why that's been so difficult and why
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:15.440]   it doesn't exist. Kevin will be computed and when they could be doable um it's it's kind of doable
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.760]   right i mean it's it's sort of doable like if you maintain a wordpress installation you know right
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.400]   everyone's while you have to hit update i mean i mean the the the goal is that you be able to deploy
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.120]   not only deploy but but seamlessly roll out updates and have those updates kind of happen in your
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.840]   cloud automatically without you having to think about it and that's a little harder to do uh and
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.400]   when we're working on that what we think up and with various cloud providers uh but but yeah we
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.360]   need to get there right but when you don't own the whole the whole stack right it gets harder to do
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.080]   updates and and easy deploys because every environment has kind of just different different variables
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.600]   well Kevin why isn't there a retail version of sales force uh our main lights again it's Halloween
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:59.280]   um uh where uh yeah even if i don't use sales force because i don't you know do the thing
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.360]   sales force does i know mark better off say we all do thing sales force does but let's just get past
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.800]   that where you do have an environment where where you couldn't you do this is there going down is
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:18.400]   you going down oh we've lost Kevin okay well i'm gonna restore a next uh but he was human to be
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:26.560]   losing his bandwidth as we went so uh i want to mention two quick things real fast uh one is uh
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:33.440]   maybe it's one actually uh sorry i'm back so i can try and respond to that go ahead um well
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.920]   in a sense we have that for for for for sales force um you can deploy apps into our cloud but then go
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.240]   out to um to to users we you know we've got a marketplace for that but as you see it's not a
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.160]   consumer you have to you have to sign up for a sales board account to get access to that um
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.480]   and similarly google has that for their um if you do apps for your domain and set stuff up there
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.240]   they've got a store there that will let you install stuff in the cloud and you're right the
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.680]   challenge is making this something that makes more sense on a consumer basis because we've managed
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.040]   to do it to install to local devices which in some ways is harder so it will be good to um
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.640]   be able to do that so yeah i agree it's something we should work on um there's one thing
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:18.080]   well we're being extremely key we the one thing we did release or is is being built is
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.960]   Heroku pipeline which is designed to make it easier to do this kind of stage deployment between
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:31.360]   different um between different devices but sorry different instances so you can just say okay
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   deploy this and then upgrade that one upgrade that one upgrade that one but it's still
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.600]   command line based it isn't fully automatic yet so there's still work to be done here
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   the challenge with this is it's all configuration management stuff and making sure that you can
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.160]   have different configurations running in different places um and then keeping track of all those
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.320]   configurations and what they're doing so it's not you know it's not um the world's hardest problem
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.320]   um it's more of a it's not but it's um more a database administration problem and authorization
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.080]   problem i think we're just going to get it if jina's told how to write an app in a way that that that
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.040]   you or google apps will allow it to happen and and allow her to update it regularly then it
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.720]   becomes a lot easier at retail level for for dummies like me to get it which we got we're running
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:22.560]   running toward what is it called home base again um uh you have a story you want to hit
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.960]   um i wanted to mention the the mark Cuban ranting at facebook story
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.960]   explain it i think that's interesting so this so so this is um what's happened is is people are
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.680]   seeing this seeing facebook as bait and switch so um when facebook was encouraging um companies to
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:47.040]   create brand pages on facebook um they said well if anyone likes you on facebook that you get the
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.440]   right to then send um emails and status updates to them and they'll see them in their timeline and
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:55.200]   that's that's how it will work so you you should encourage people to like you on facebook because
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.040]   that will give you access to them so they were trying to create a sort of knowledge network within
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:07.200]   facebook of that um then um as they improved their um i think they were edge rank algorithm that
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.520]   decides which stories um they show in your feed because if they try to show you all the stories
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.120]   that were potentially in your feed um you it would scroll fast and you could read it um they found
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.080]   that a lot of these um corporate messages and a lot of these other things were not things people
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.720]   were interacting with and so they were getting de-emphasized in their feed so now facebook is
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:31.200]   selling promoted stories to you to say well if you want people to actually see these things you're
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.880]   posting you should pay us money and then they'll show up as promoted things in the same way that
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:40.480]   twitter does mode it tweets and there's been a huge backlash from the from the brand people who who
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.360]   feel betrayed by facebook for this saying wait a minute but you told us we could talk to people
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.960]   and now you're saying we have to pay you to talk to people and this is this is nasty and
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:54.400]   and Cuban as as posted a big rant about this um and said i'm going to take all my
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   NBA teams and my personal HD networks and blah blah blah and whatever else he does um off facebook
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:07.600]   and put them on my space which is um interesting threat um but the the the point is it is this
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:13.840]   tension between um what is it that i've chosen to see and what is the algorithm trying to see me
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.640]   this sort of the the true twitter which is true of of of twitter especially of facebook and also
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:24.080]   google plus it's less true of twitter because twitter doesn't you know shows you everyone you
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.080]   subscribe to by default but it acknowledges that you don't see everything so it tries to show you
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:34.080]   but it will also send you other random things now and then yeah right um so so twitter the
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.120]   promoted tweets come to you even though you don't subscribe to them whereas for facebook they're
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:45.120]   saying you already subscribed to um mark Cuban business whatever it is um but you won't like
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.240]   but likely won't see it um but if he pays us three thousand dollars then that many people will get
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.440]   to see it it'll show up in their stream at some point um so there's there there is a tension here
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:01.920]   between you know what's well who gets to see what um this is also potentially both facebook and twitter's
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:07.680]   way of getting around the we can't sell ads on mobile problem by selling ads that are actually part
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:14.000]   of the stream um so there's there's you know there is that tension between the two there which is
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.720]   how much of your stream would you like to be taken over with that so they do need a charge
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.680]   enough for that um that um people don't give up reading facebook or twitter entirely because
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.520]   their stream gets gets completely flooded with it so it's a messy dynamic um it's going to be
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.600]   interesting to watch it play out um but it's interesting to see that there is such a strong
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.560]   revolt against it from some of the content providers who who suddenly feel they've been held hostage
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:47.440]   thank you i didn't understand that g_n_a_ reaction to cuban's rant uh i thought it was funny
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.720]   that was about it
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:56.560]   i want to mention one story and then we'll get to our tools and tips and stuff
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.840]   um and it is not exactly a light topic it's not at all but it was fascinating that the
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:11.760]   israeli defense force the idea of announced a uh military assault on hamas in gazza today
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:20.160]   not in a press conference not in a press release but on twitter and uh what is also fascinating is
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:27.760]   that hamas came back and then attacked the idea of on twitter so idea of said uh we we recommend
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.560]   that no hamas operatives whether low level or senior leaders show their faces above ground
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:40.080]   of the days ahead and uh the al kasam brigades came back and said our blessed hands will reach
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.240]   your leaders and soldiers wherever they are you open to hell gates on your cells
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.680]   well i guess my only reaction to this is i wish the twitter were the only place they were fighting
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:56.720]   uh but i find it fascinating that that even a a global war starts to be played out in our little
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:06.080]   world uh so that was all i had to say about that yeah that's pretty incredible we go from
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.640]   josten beiber and like ufc fighters calling out fights and the president basically accepting his
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.520]   reelection right to to that i mean it's it's incredible really what goes on at twitter now
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.720]   it's basically it's an acknowledgement of the power of twitter for for you know good or bad or
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.320]   whatever you think of it it's it's the way to go directly to people and directly to media as well
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.720]   so all right so uh hopefully survive pretty much without a few technical glitches uh
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.760]   you'll do tools tips in whatever we call them Kevin do you have any uh
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.520]   contribution of that end or you don't have to um um well my mind was uh open garden that was my
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:47.040]   my um tool of the week um which is which is the sort of personal area networking um and this is
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:51.600]   it's a amount of like ridiculous um luxury here which is if you have two android devices and one
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.800]   of them has connectivity the other one can get connectivity to which is like mmm but as i do i
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.840]   i found it really useful that that was something that was actually very practical for me this week
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:06.800]   so i'm recommending that um if you have particularly if you have a next a seven that's wi-fi only um
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.800]   but has bluetooth and you have a phone that has other connectivity you suddenly find you can
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:17.040]   use them both as you're as you're wondering around which is nice beautiful yeah that is nice uh
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:25.520]   cool new chrome experiment really quickly called uh 100 000 stars the short URL is g.co/100 000 stars
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:31.120]   uh takes visualizes 100 000 stars closest closest to the sun using data from an array of sources
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:37.840]   including nasa and the european space agency and you kind of zoom around and and click around to
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.080]   sort of explore the galaxy and look at different star names it's a really really neat chrome
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:47.200]   experiment i think it runs only in chrome i think that that's uh it uses uh the experiment makes
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:55.200]   use of google chrome support for web gl css 3d and web audio uh so really cool g.co/100 000 stars
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.120]   we got a moment and you want to take a look at the sky and it kind of walks you through a little
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:06.080]   narrative at first which chat is showing us here cool i really cool yeah but it's cool
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:15.760]   oh that oh it moves there's music you're fogs audio what you see is a whole bunch of stars
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.000]   you look at the sky it'll work too but it's really very neat whole music oh wow
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:29.280]   cool is fascinated without our space aren't they yeah they love stars and all these things
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.960]   nasa yeah this is fantastic for kids especially well kids and adults we're all
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:45.120]   all right so number of the week uh very quickly google's worldwide ad revenue
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.440]   reached 10.9 billion dollars in the first half and somebody came in and noticed that that was more
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:58.160]   than all of the us print ad revenue so it's a big apples and oranges apples and gumquats it's
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:06.320]   google worldwide versus us only print nonetheless it's why everybody is so jealous of google
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.760]   and going after their butt because google is making more in ad revenue than all print media now
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:20.080]   making the united states and that is a pretty astonishing stat in and of itself so i think that
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:27.360]   we made it uh chat thank you very very much the indubitable amazing chat has brought us home uh
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:34.240]   here uh kevin we want to thank you for joining us in our um leo this week you want to plug

[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:45.520]   shows in the archive there if you want to go back and look at it uh a move to do a kickstarter to pay
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.360]   for the production assistance that kevin needs to bring back to tumblevision is that would that
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:54.320]   be uh accurate that could be something that could be done yeah the challenges we we lost our producer
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:59.360]   and between the three of us we're not we're not organized enough to produce it ourselves so we
