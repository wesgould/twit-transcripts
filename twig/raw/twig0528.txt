[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Coming up on this week in Google, I'm Jason Halifil and in for Leo, we've got Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis and Anne Pruitt.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We're going to talk about the limitations of Google Translate, Pixel Buds,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   have a sequel that might be coming very, very soon. The Microsoft Surface Duo that was announced this morning is running Android.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000]   Stacey gives us her favorite things from Amazon's hardware event,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and Jeff feels vindicated for his hatred of dark mode. All that and more coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   NetCasts you love.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is Twig.

[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo, who is gone.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He's at the last pass event that you've probably been hearing a lot about leading up to it. That happens tomorrow.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So he's there. I think they're scoped in the place. Maybe they're partying. I don't know. Maybe both. Who knows?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Joining us as always today, of course, Jeff Jarvis is joining buzzmachine.com. How you doing, Jeff?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Great. Glad to be here. Hello, hello, hello. Nice to see you. Also, Stacey Higginbotham. StaceyOnIOT.com. What's up, Stacey?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Everything. Everything. Everything. So much news, I can't wait.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   We do have a lot of stuff to talk about. And, of course, here at the table. To my left this time, I think last time you were on my right.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Every time we'll trade seats. We'll see where it works. This is my...bad? No? This is my good...I don't know.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We can do a vote. We gotta figure out which side is the good side. Which side is the good side? The gray side or the not so gray side?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Oh, is there a difference? Oh, there's definitely a difference, Miss. What side is the easier facial?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah? Okay. All right, so that's our gray area. All right. So your left side is less gray. Your right side is more gray.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm just so much. I'm just so well. I'm just so well. Yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Hipster Gravitas. Hipster Gravitas.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Please don't make this into a GIF. Business in front, party.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yes, someone probably is already working on your animated GIF.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So... I want to start with something. Okay, excellent. I love it. Take it a vindicated bottom of the rundown.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You're suckers. Okay. I'm so happy you brought this up. I was wondering if it would end up making it in here.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm curious too. We're starting with it because I'm vindicated. Okay.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   This modo says it's all BS. Okay, this guy on his modo says it's all BS.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, this guy says it's good enough for me. He has to research.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Adam Agnes to tidbits explains in his Austin detail that except in extraordinary situations,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   dark mode is not easy on the eyes in any way. Well, how is that?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, the Forest of Manthic Hole reports that researchers found that people with a stigmatism,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   light text on dark backgrounds aggravates the condition making text harder to read.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   What's more, as Suzanne Mayer, a university of Passau researcher, said, who conducted multiple studies
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and found which design screws with our brain.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   In all the studies, participants were better performing in the positive polarity condition,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   otherwise known as not dark mode. They detected more errors and read faster when dark text was presented
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   on light background rather than the reverse. So I just want this on the record that I'm not
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   the same for my hatred for dark mode. No, I'm not done. I'm not done.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We're sticking with light mode. Light mode's the way to go. It's the way God made bones.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You know, John, could you just kill the lights in here? It's too bright for me right now.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's far too bright. Thank you. This is what we need to do.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Oh, there we go. So I know Antisomatronicity.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'll just throw out the two times that I really like. I like dark mode on Twitter,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   where reading comprehension doesn't really matter as much because it's very short.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And then I also like it when I am in a professional setting or like a conference setting,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and I'm trying to type without everybody else being really aware of what I'm typing and that
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm typing. And dark mode is awesome for that.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   So those are my pro dark mode moments.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I appreciate dark mode when I am in a dark environment.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Like I think that that is an very honest like application of why dark mode can be very useful.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   If I'm in a dark environment, like if I pick up my phone off the bedside table or whatever,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   it's dark in the room and I look at it. It's a bright white.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That does irritate my eyes.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Shoxi.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I mean, it's not like discomfortable or uncomfortable, not uncomfortable.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's a word.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But at the same time, like a darker mode is more pleasing.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So I can prefer it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Your eyes are smart.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   They figure it out.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Sure.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So when I have a migraine, dark mode is the only way I can get online.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Pull it out the migraine card, aren't they?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The cranky old man card.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Come on.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I got it.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I got to do the migraine.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.600]   You see, I battle with this and I'm one of those people that see better at nighttime than
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   I do in the daytime.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.560]   And it's been that way for about as long as I can remember.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.800]   As a matter of fact, just within the last hour, I was walking the hallway and I had on
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   my sunglasses and I had to think, oh, take your sunglasses off.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   You forgot these.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.400]   I want you to do the show in the sunglasses.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   This is your new look.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   I would.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   But I really do open your--
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   The Anna Winduels.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   --a twin.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.440]   I do get better use out of the dark mode on my eyes because of the sensitivity.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.360]   I like having a better contrast when I look at the screen.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   And heck, even sitting in the office with Mr. Howell here.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.800]   Yeah, I like the time.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.480]   When I get here before them most of the time.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.120]   And the office is dark and I have on one little lamp because that's enough to me.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.160]   You look at your dark mode with sunglasses on.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.520]   Are you double dark mode?
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   I have.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   Super duper dark mode.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   That's not a purpose, but I have.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.240]   All right, here's the next question.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.160]   So when you're on a plane--
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   Sound glasses on.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   --is a lot of fight going on.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.360]   No, there's a lot of fight going on these days on the rights on planes.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.760]   And when I go on the plane because I'm global services, bow down before me.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.280]   I go on a plane before the pilot does.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   That's the first one.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   I go--
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   --to seat on the aisle.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   --on my aisle.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.920]   I always raise the shades.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.360]   I want the shades up.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.760]   I can't stand on people, the shades down.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.480]   Are you a shades up or shades down person on planes?
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   Good question.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   Good question.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.960]   There's a good reason for this, though.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.200]   I am a shades up for that.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.920]   But that's because I am a aviation nerd.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.520]   I love airplanes.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.200]   So I'm always looking out with my sunglasses on shades.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.160]   I'm a shades down.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.320]   Jeff, I can't believe it.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.800]   We don't agree on anything.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Shocking.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   Tries.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   You know, again, for me, it mirrors my dark mode rationale.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.240]   It depends on the time of day.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.760]   If it's daytime, I want the shades up.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.480]   If it's nighttime or if it's early morning, that's probably the more applicable time.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.680]   If I travel to the airport and it's like 5.30 in the morning, I have to catch a flight
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680]   or whatever.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.720]   The sun's going to come up and I do want to sleep a little bit.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   Sure.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   Shades down.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   That's fine.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.400]   But I'm also the same person that discussed last week that I wear my glasses just sparingly.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.280]   And it's clearly helped my eyes over the years because I don't have to wear them all the
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   time the way most people--
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   Oh, it's vanity.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   It's pure vanity.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   No, no, no, I don't wear glasses all the time either.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.200]   How did you not deserve it?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.960]   And it's because I hate having a filter between me and people I'm talking to.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.440]   I feel like-- I don't know why.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   I just--
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   I can't always take them off.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.680]   I can't walk to the bathroom from bed without glasses off.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.520]   I can't talk to anything without glasses off.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   Wow.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.080]   Yeah, my eyes are probably about as bad as yours.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.280]   It sounds like--
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.520]   Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   It's--
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.520]   All right.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   I'm on the record here.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   It's good.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.240]   Gizmodo says dark mode is for suckers.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   And you still are wrong.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   And the couch says it.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240]   So we should all heed what he says.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   That's it.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   That said, I never quote Gizmodo, but now they're right.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   And I mean, a large part of what he's saying here is that it's a trend.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   Like dark mode is a trend.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.440]   Therefore, people like it because people like it.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.160]   And I mean, yeah, there's probably a little bit of truth to that actually.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   Shoots.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   Dark mode shoots.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.120]   But I know that I like it for reasons outside of that too.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.360]   I think it's certain times of day for me, it's more aesthetically pleasing to my eyes.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.320]   There are people that are following the trend because they've heard about it.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.480]   But again, there's people like me.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.760]   It's just for comfort.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   Comfort.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.240]   And some people will tell the battery savings and everything.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.440]   Andrew makes the point like if you really added it up, you're probably not saving that
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   much.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.360]   And a lot of dark mode is not true dark anyways.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   It's like a shade of gray and you're still burning battery and you do that.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.560]   So what are you really saving?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.960]   And you have to be on the, you know, an AMOLED display so that you have to have the right
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.840]   display technology for that to even matter.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.760]   So anyways, I don't know.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.080]   If you like dark mode, now you have the option at the end of the day.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.680]   Isn't it nice to have options?
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   Yes.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.320]   No, options are good.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   All right.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.360]   I'm happy we got the most important story out of the way at the very top.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.640]   I was going to ask about that because I saw it and Jeff, did you send it to us or did
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   I just see it?
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   Uh-huh.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   I just did it.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   Okay.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   I was so victorious.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.240]   I emailed it to the team during the week.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.120]   You're like, "Boo-yah!"
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120]   I saw it at night.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120]   I just said, "Bless his heart."
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   I said, "There you go.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.040]   That is the true southern passive aggressive right there."
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   This is totally.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.840]   Aww, bless his little heart.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.340]   That Jeff.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.340]   That's funny.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.260]   All right, so where do we even go from dark mode?
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.940]   From there, there's the highlight of the show clearly already.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.940]   All right, cool.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.940]   Well, we started on top.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   That's it.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   It's all the time to descend into...
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.940]   We want to talk about neutrality.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.940]   Okay.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   We want to talk about Google.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940]   Let's talk about Google a little bit.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.340]   We'll go to Google and then we'll go for...
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.180]   Yeah, then we'll spread out and spread our wings into Amazon.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.180]   That way we do.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.740]   Because I know we're going to talk about Amazon a little bit because Stacey, that event was
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.340]   after last week's twig.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.980]   Yeah, I missed our...
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.500]   I missed twig because I was at Amazon's event.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   You guys were there.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   Wait a second.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.500]   I'll remember.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.100]   I have a question for you, Stacey, when we get to it.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.100]   All right.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.540]   What about this whole DNS over HTTPS thing in Chrome?
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.500]   Wall Street Journal has a report that reveals the house judiciary committee is investigating
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   Google for its plans.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.140]   You guys explained this to us.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.180]   Implement DNS encryption within the Chrome browser.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.540]   And ISPs are complaining about this.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.060]   Basically, from what I gather, Google wants to make things safer and more secure and more
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.340]   private for users of Chrome.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.100]   And so baking in encryption, DNS encryption within the Chrome browser would allow them
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.100]   to do that.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.020]   But ISPs are realizing, "Hey, when you do that, we can no longer see the activity of
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.140]   users using the browser, and therefore we cannot do the things that we want to do with
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.700]   all of that data to make money on our end, and that's not okay."
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.460]   Can I ask a dumb question?
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.660]   Which is my stock and trade?
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.020]   Yeah, I might not even have an answer for it.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:20.980]   So DNS resolves a name to an address.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.100]   Once I go to that IP address, that can't be encrypted from the ISP because they've got
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.100]   to take me to that address, right?
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:37.060]   So this is saying that your DNS resolver, which can be operated by your ISP or you can
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.340]   go through another service, that's what they're saying.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.340]   They want to make that encrypted, and they want to make that a standard.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.340]   So if you do something--
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.340]   The safety safety-- I'm dumb.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340]   I'm dumb.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.340]   No slow here.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   Just slow.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.340]   Okay.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.340]   What part of that transaction is encrypted?
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.340]   Right now, nothing.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.980]   Right, but if Google gets its way.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.460]   If Google gets its way, what will happen?
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.660]   Okay, here we go.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.060]   I'm pulling up the site just so I can make sure I don't do this wrong.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.060]   Appreciate yourselves.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.540]   Hold onto the table.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.540]   Okay.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.500]   We're all counting on you, Stacey.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   Okay.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   Okay.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.500]   This is DNS.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:28.380]   So DNS, the process of looking up the IP address when you type the site's name and raise it.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   Type to the name of the site.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.380]   I type in the name of the site.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.860]   There's this magical long number that happens.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.220]   The DNS is the look up to match that name.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.260]   Stacey and IT to that number to send you to that place.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:46.220]   What they want to do is they want to route that over HTTPS, which is the current secure
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.420]   protocol that we route everything over.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.700]   And Google, was it two or three years ago that they were like made HTTPS?
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.260]   The fault requirement, yes, but yeah.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.140]   So they want to do this for doing DNS lookups over that.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.900]   So people can't eavesdrop during that transaction where they're looking this up.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.580]   And they're going to block and they're going to do that by encrypting your DNS requests.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.860]   Oh, wait, that's okay.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.540]   So because that's because that's an external communication to somebody else's DNS.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.860]   I use 1.1.1.1.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.860]   It goes over there.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.580]   So they want to encrypt that so that nobody can stoop on that.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:32.740]   However, once I get back the number, it's 123.4 of 5.5.6.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.740]   Then the ISP knows where I'm going.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.540]   So how is the ISP left out of any data other than the name of the server, which they could
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   probably reverse resolve?
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.780]   That's a good question.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:52.260]   Okay, but your ISP like, okay, your ISP still okay.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.180]   I still trust the Stacey.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   No, you're right.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.900]   I'm like, okay, here's where here's one right brain.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.660]   If you're not using your DNS.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.140]   I'm like, because I don't use it.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.540]   So they shouldn't ever see it, right?
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:13.420]   Well, but they're always going to see the IP number of where I go because they have
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.460]   to route me to it.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.820]   No, because the DNS service is routing you to it.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   You're doing all of that.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.420]   It's almost nice to have the address.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.300]   Yes, like if you're using 1.1.1.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:35.100]   However many ones or Google's, they're doing the resolution, not your ISP.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   Your ISP.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.500]   Every time all those packets are being encrypted.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.940]   So your ISP just sees the encrypted packets.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.940]   They go up to the DNS resolver.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   Even the IP number?
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.940]   So I open a page.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.100]   I open Stacey on IoT and then say compact, designed, wonderful page.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.740]   So there's 10 server calls that one page.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.500]   Each of those calls is then the ISP is blind to each call.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   I believe so.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   Okay.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500]   Wow.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   Let me keep breaking.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.500]   Now I'm looking at other options.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.940]   And I'm reading through the SARS Technica article by Timothy B. Lee.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.580]   Big ISPs aren't happy about Google's plans for encrypted DNS.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:20.060]   And it says in here, ISPs could still see which IP address a customer had accessed, which
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.900]   would give them some of this information, which could be an effective way to detect malware
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   infections, for example.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.340]   But this is a cruder way to monitor internet traffic.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.380]   Multiple domains could share a single IP address.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.340]   Domains can change IP addresses over time.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.580]   So they'd wind up with reduced visibility of their customer's browsing habits, which
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.580]   is a very good way to detect the IP address.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.860]   So the next question becomes, why does your ISP need to know this in any case?
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   Well, that's a great question.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.860]   Yes.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.500]   One will speak to you by targeting VPNs now.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.460]   You're asking, you want this?
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.060]   They do it just, I mean, they used to remember how they used to do DNS takeovers.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.140]   Do you guys remember that?
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.140]   Let's see.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.660]   I'm trying to remember Frontier used to do it and some other small ISP used to do it.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.740]   If you type in a URL slightly wrong, you would get an ad from your ISP.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.740]   Yes.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.140]   They do it because they want to have this information.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:23.420]   And I should say, in the chat room, someone just explained that the DNS server does not
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.660]   do the resolution.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.140]   So I'm sorry on that one.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.180]   The DNS server does not write back to the website.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.180]   Yes.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.180]   So my bad.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:39.620]   So, so given the choice of trusting my ISP or Google, hey, I'm not just looking Google.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.820]   But okay, but this is, this is DNS over HTTPS.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.220]   This isn't just a Google thing.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.380]   But Google's, it's the fight.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.620]   Google's trying to do something that the ISP is fighting.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.620]   Right.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.860]   Who do I trust in that, in that fight?
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.220]   Oh, always trust Google over the ISPs if they're fighting.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.220]   Okay.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.220]   Yeah, I would agree with that.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.580]   That's, that's a good rule of thumb.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.500]   And Google has also said it has no plans to centralize or change to go away Google, to
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.500]   centralize or change people's DNS providers to Google by default also.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.300]   So there, there have been people there, you know, some that have wondered or questions
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:19.660]   Google's, you know, intent to move, move them over to, to Google for the DNS providers.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.020]   This is another interesting question here.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.860]   So I see PC guy, 8088.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.540]   I love saying 8088.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.540]   So as some people, I'm not sure.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.820]   So as some ISPs could block access over the UK because they have a list of sites that
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.900]   are blocked in nations that are blocked.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   Does this get away?
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.660]   Does this get around things like Chinese censorship?
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.660]   Oh, good question.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.660]   I don't know.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.660]   That's my question.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.660]   I do not know.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.660]   I'm nothing but questions today, people.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.660]   Nothing but answers.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.660]   That's okay.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.940]   I would also tell you, Jeff, that Mozilla in E, I always do this wrong, E F, E F F.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.940]   E F F.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.140]   E F F and Mozilla are also in favor of doing this.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.740]   So even if you don't trust Google, I'm guessing you probably trust Mozilla's.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   Okay.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:12.140]   And someone in chat, the name just just blew past me here, but made the good point that
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.340]   this isn't necessarily about Google except for the fact that Chrome is so popular.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.460]   And so Chrome does this, then it kind of is, you know, in many people's view about Google
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.220]   because they've made this switch that's going to be so many users.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.620]   Does Firefox has already done this?
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.140]   I believe that they do this.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.140]   Yes.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.460]   Oh, yes, they do.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.460]   Look at this.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.460]   Redcon 5.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.460]   Thank you, Redcon 5.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.820]   The on point answer right at the moment.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.540]   He is giving us shows.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.820]   His best ring for screen.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.860]   Like a, like a, the, the twit brain just comes together at one time.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.860]   It's so impressive.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Really.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.860]   Why are we here?
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.860]   That's the question.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.140]   Is it zero latency right now with us right there?
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.140]   She is right there.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.660]   Oh, you see here's something saying.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   Let's see.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660]   Yes.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.380]   This does not get around the great firewall, which would make sense because that's pretty
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.380]   non porous.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.940]   Thank you very much, everybody, including Redcon 5.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.660]   I think, I think we all learned a little something with that.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.660]   I was not prepared for this.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.980]   I did read a lot about net neutrality though, you guys.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.700]   I do think it's a new game.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.700]   Stump the Stacy.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.900]   That's a terrible game because this source of things.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.300]   Oh, I love that because Stacy knows everything.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.620]   No, I don't know anything.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620]   It is so sad.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.380]   We weren't able to stumper this time.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.380]   Dang it.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.380]   Well, that worked really hard.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.700]   I could not answer off the top of my head.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   It's okay.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.580]   If you stump the Stacy, you get free warm warm bread warm, warm cake, warm cake, free
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.580]   warm cake.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.580]   Oh, man, you guys.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   Okay.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.380]   Storyville coffee.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.660]   They have it in Seattle and in Bay Bridge.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.660]   It's random.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.340]   It's so good.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.020]   Stacy is the sacrifice Stacy's making people.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.700]   For those of you who came in with the actual show is that she could be in a coffee shop
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.380]   right now getting free warm cake.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.140]   But instead she sacrificed.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.620]   She's here with you with this.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.100]   It's warm chocolate cake.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.580]   Oh, the icing is still like not totally melty, but sort of melty.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.580]   That sounds great.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.140]   And there's a little hint of coffee in there.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.140]   It's so.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.140]   Dang.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.140]   Oh, so sad for Stacy.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.140]   I know.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.140]   I'm sad for all of us.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   To be honest.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.540]   I'd rather be talking about DNS encryption.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   You guys.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:29.320]   If we're talking about DNS encryption, we would really, you know, we would really
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.140]   prefer not to do it without you.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.420]   To be honest, it's made much better having you here.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.180]   What about a translation at the border?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.380]   Lots of fun stories today.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.620]   ProPublica report shows how US citizenship and immigration services has been using and
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:52.340]   relying in many ways on Google Translate to scan refugees social media posts to determine
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.340]   whether they should be allowed in the country.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.340]   So Google provides this app.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.500]   It's what is going on.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.700]   I'm not even saying the word.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.420]   My phone keeps waking up.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   Google provides this.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.220]   We can't use the word Google.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.620]   Apparently it's going to happen like five more times.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.580]   I'm convinced.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.620]   This app is not meant for this, right?
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.660]   I'll just say that, right?
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.500]   Probably you should not use this.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.540]   One should not use this app to determine people's livelihoods or, you know, the ability for
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.100]   them to be safe or, you know, it just seems like the wrong application of this particular
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.100]   issue.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.940]   If you think that that facial recognition has problems, Google Translate has problems.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940]   It's a long way.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   It's a long way.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.220]   It's a basic Google Translate.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.740]   It did help me in Shanghai, but still it could still use some more.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.940]   You don't want to get arrested on this.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.620]   Well, I just got a press release or wasn't a press release.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.020]   It was a story in a Chinese newspaper.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.340]   So it was written in Mandarin and I Google translated it.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   It was all about Jeff.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:03.420]   I'm out the former CEO of GE joining the board of a company called Graffiti Intelligence.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.900]   I was looking at this because someone sent it to me and they were talking about Tuya,
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.420]   which is a smart home IoT company.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.740]   I'm like, I don't see Tuya anywhere in here.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.140]   So I send an email out to the Tuya people and I'm like, what is going on?
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.340]   And they're like, oh, this is a Google Translatism.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.100]   Tuya means graffiti in Chinese.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.540]   So Tuya Smart became graffiti intelligence as the name of the company.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:33.020]   And I had spent like a good 45 minutes trying to like, I don't see the relationship that
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.300]   this person is telling me is here.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.860]   What is this graffiti intelligence?
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.060]   So again, as a journalist, even I don't trust it.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.260]   Well, there's a lot of there's a lot of lost nuance in the tool.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.220]   I mean, it's a wonderful brilliant thing, but totally.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:58.380]   It's come a long way, but like they actually had a demonstration in this article in Urdu.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.860]   I think that's the name of the language.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.780]   Urdu, Urdu, you are due.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:07.180]   Post would correctly translate by if a human translator, you know, took a stab at it, would
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:13.180]   say I have been spanked a lot and have also gathered a lot of love in parentheses for
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.420]   my parents.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:20.140]   Google Translate's version came out to the beating is too big and the love is too windy.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.540]   So there's nuance that is definitely lost in translation.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.460]   And you know, it also kind of smacks of we talked about this a little bit last week on
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.100]   Techniques Weekly with Micah.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.980]   So it's one of his stories of the week.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.300]   And for me, it just kind of smacks of using a tool that might not be perfect for the job,
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.900]   but for some of the folks who are using this tool, that's actually a really convenient
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:51.700]   fact that it doesn't do a good job of the translation because it creates more uncertainty,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.020]   which could result in making it much easier to say, no, you can't come into the contradiction.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.980]   Let's just say some people that is priority number one.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.740]   So not just poor judgment, but incorrect judgment.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.620]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.620]   Incorrect.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.820]   We read the chaos administration.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.940]   Something like this helps contribute to that.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:12.940]   Totally.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.940]   Totally.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.820]   And I mean, the manual for the service for the US citizenship and immigration services
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.820]   reads, the most efficient approach to translate foreign language contents is to utilize one
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.860]   of the many free online language translation services provided by Google, Yahoo, Bing and
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.820]   other search engines.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:37.540]   And it's just such a critical application, like our critical need being translation
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:44.580]   to rely on these free services translated, tries to explain their languages.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   Right.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.580]   It's just a cluster.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.180]   It's baffling to me that we have people in granted, there are plenty of languages that
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.140]   are way more esoteric, but probably the top 10 languages, I feel like we should have
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.100]   people who are multilingual.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.340]   I mean, that doesn't seem tough.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.340]   Should.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.140]   It's just definitely uncommon here.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.300]   I know in my travels, it blew my mind when I went somewhere and people could speak English
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.980]   as well as I do.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.180]   Well, attempt to speak English is more sometimes better.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.180]   Right.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.180]   Or better.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.700]   I'm always like, oh, you didn't even grow up where I grew up.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.660]   So how are you able to just grab all of these extra languages in a snow big deal?
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.260]   But here in the US is like, you go to a hotel.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.260]   What?
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.580]   And they speak four languages.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.620]   And you think in the US, you'd be lucky to get two tops.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.020]   You know, yeah, I speak one, I always say I speak 1.1 languages.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.020]   Right.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.020]   All right.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.980]   I'm going to just light a zashlet.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.300]   Yeah, you've got some choice phrases that I know I've heard on the show many times.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   I used to go, should there we go.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.820]   Gutenberg is just someone's name though, Jason.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.540]   Good enough.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.220]   Good enough for me.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   Let's see here.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.020]   New European copyright laws going to stop Google from showing news snippets to fresh
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.260]   is a big deal.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.220]   This is a big deal.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.700]   Only showing headlines, not the first few lines from the story or even a thumbnail image,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.180]   although publications can request to show those previews if they prefer European public
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.900]   publishers can do that.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.340]   France is the first to implement the copyright reforms.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.140]   Other countries have around a year to implement them.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   So this is like the beginning of a funny idea.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.540]   So funny I should mention the Liesto Gershortz direct.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.100]   Yes.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.100]   Because this is a continuation of that.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.860]   Liesto Gershortz direct, answer a copyright, try to stop Google from showing snippets unless
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.460]   they paid Google said a few publishers said a few and back.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.460]   They went a week without Google.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.100]   They said, Oh, never mind.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.860]   You can show our stuff.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.580]   Then it went to Spain where there's a link tax.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.820]   There was no choice in the matter.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.540]   Google had to negotiate payment.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.140]   Google said, no, we're not doing that.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.220]   Google's news left Spain.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.380]   Then it became part of the infamous articles 11 and 13, which later became articles 15
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.380]   and 17.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.380]   Don't ask me how.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.820]   I don't know of the European copyright directive, an effort to have a copyright reform.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.340]   So there's one regime across Europe.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.820]   The publishers lobbied for this.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.740]   They won. It's a snippet law and Google cannot put up content.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:31.260]   No shush cannot put up snippets unless they have negotiated the license and Google saying,
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.740]   we're not going to do that.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   Never we're never going to do that.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.460]   We don't pay for content.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.860]   We don't get paid either.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.140]   This is not the way we do it.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.380]   We're not doing it.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.620]   And Richard Jinger versus how to Google News went to France to make clear to everybody this
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.700]   was the case.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.460]   And so we'll put your link in, but we won't put the snippet in and you're not going to
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.180]   get any traffic out of it because nobody's going to know if it's worth clicking on, but
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.660]   hey, you asked for it.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.900]   You can say, yes, as Jason just said, you can say, no, put us up.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.340]   But then that's the only condition of which is going to happen.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.820]   This is going to happen across all of Europe.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.180]   It's going to hurt publishers terribly.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.780]   I've been in rooms with, I was at Google News guys in Athens in Europe about two months
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.940]   ago, journalists in the room, in a big room, in one of the sessions that I caused were
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.860]   complaining mightily about this saying it's going to kill them.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.620]   And I said, blame your bosses.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.100]   How long do you think we see this eventually get turned around?
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.500]   Is this something that could be turned around within a quarter?
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.260]   Is it going to take a year of going through?
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.340]   Oh, I think every time it's happened, a good question.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.380]   I think what it happened, it originally happened in Belgium, where there was an effort to do
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:38.180]   this earlier than the Lijstung Schutzrecht, which I love saying.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.180]   And the Belgian publishers turned right around.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.780]   The German publishers turned around.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.700]   The Spanish publishers lost traffic forever.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.780]   I think that most publishers in France will turn around in a week or two and say, OK,
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.700]   Google, uncle, put up our content.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   OK.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.540]   I'm surprised my phone didn't show off.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.020]   I should have just watched my video.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.700]   Somehow my phone missed it.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.180]   Somebody out there, they got it.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.820]   All right, so a couple of weeks before the publishers themselves say, yes, OK, make
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.460]   this happen because we've already seen stuff, you know, the traffic tank.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:18.820]   And I mean, I can't recall if you mentioned this, but Spain, Germany, they had tried this
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.940]   years ago taking the snippets out of the news articles and ultimately, you know, they
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.380]   had to, yeah, it completely backfired.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:32.460]   So, in fact, part of the argument in Germany around the Lijstung Schutzrecht, Lijstung
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.260]   Schutzrecht, I see how many times it is.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.260]   What is that word?
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.940]   The drinking game at this point.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.380]   It's translated as ancillary copyright.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   OK.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.820]   I'm not sure Lijstung, Lijstung, Lijstung.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:55.820]   OK, Google, translate Lijstung from Germany to Germany to English.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.660]   Power power.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   Lijstung Schutzrecht.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660]   I don't know.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.660]   I don't know Stacy.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.740]   I was like, I love how Germans have these phrases.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.740]   You got me back.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.300]   That was Stump the Jeff.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   Sorry.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.020]   You get free warm cake.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.820]   Don't say that if you can't follow through.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.820]   What was the question?
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.820]   What was the question?
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.620]   That's a good question.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.460]   I can't remember.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.460]   I was distracted by cake.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.420]   Oh, it never went.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.420]   So, all right.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.900]   I don't know where to go on from there.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   Copy right.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   Where do we go?
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   Yes, I know.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   I know.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.900]   I know.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.340]   I've got this warm cake repeating in my brain.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.340]   We could talk about jackets.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.740]   So, I know that a couple of weeks ago, you guys talked a little bit about the Eve St.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.460]   Laurent backpack strap that has--
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.460]   A strap.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.460]   That is Project Jacar.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.460]   Sure.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.460]   It's actually a whole backpack.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.460]   It's not just the strap.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.460]   That's true.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.900]   The whole backpack exists and then the strap has Project Jacar in it for, you know, touch
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.780]   sensitivity, control of your phone, that sort of stuff.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.980]   Now we've got a jacket, which is not the first jacket that we've seen with this.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.700]   In fact, the first product was a couple of years ago.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.700]   It was a Levi's Corrier jacket.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.020]   So, this is the backpack from a couple of weeks ago.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.740]   And now Levi is selling-- about to sell anyways.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:27.300]   A couple of new denim jackets with a smaller Jacar tag than before.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.820]   And the tag is the electrical kind of pod that actually does the transmission via Bluetooth.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.780]   And it has to live somewhere in the jacket.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.460]   So I think they're putting it in the sleeve.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.420]   It's a smaller profile.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.940]   So in two years, they've reduced the size of that.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.980]   A trucker and Sherpa trucker jackets for men and women.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:53.900]   $198 to $248, which-- I mean, I think Jean jackets are kind of in that price range, right?
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:59.780]   Well, no, the Levi's jacket, like a straight up Levi's trucker, is usually around $85.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.020]   If you do the Sherpa, though, it's going to be much more.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.020]   Okay.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.020]   So it's $100.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.020]   Oh, really?
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.020]   I thought they were over 100 bucks.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.020]   I thought.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.620]   The truckers?
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.940]   I feel like I just was in the market for one.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.860]   I mean, that was a ladies jacket.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.020]   But yeah, I'm seeing them for $98 to $70.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.420]   Nordstrom's has it for $98.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.420]   So that's an expensive issue, co.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.700]   I had a touch on it.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   So smart jackets.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:31.140]   And it was their commuter jacket for people who care about jackets, which I actually do
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   care about.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   Right.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.220]   Well, so the first one that they did was the-- was it the commuter jacket or the courier?
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   It's their commuter jacket.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.660]   The commuter jacket, okay.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.180]   And that was, if I remember correctly, Google really, when they first announced this, it
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:51.460]   was like-- it was for, you know, bike couriers was kind of what they-- what they promoted
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.420]   for this, yeah, right?
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.340]   Like that-- when you're riding, you don't want to look at your phone.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.700]   So it's, you know, it's slightly different.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.300]   It's probably the only one that-- we haven't seen the hard hoodie given where it comes
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   from.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   Google?
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   The land of hoodies.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   What is it about?
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   Oh, okay.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   I was like-- no, you're right.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   You're right.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   I was a little late on that one.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.800]   They need to have some hoodies out there.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.700]   The all of Silicon Valley, it would probably become a status.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.820]   You know where I wanted to check hard?
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.820]   Where?
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.260]   I wanted my couch.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:30.220]   I actually want the little thing in my arm of my couch or my recliner.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.220]   Because then after--
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.220]   You remote control?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.700]   My new remote control, yes.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.700]   That would be--
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.260]   That's very cool.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.260]   That's cool.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.260]   I like that.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.140]   And the back of your couch would have a little plug for you to plug it into the power supply.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.140]   You would need it.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.540]   I mean, I don't think you need a plug for this.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.580]   You just-- it's just-- you'd have the little-- the little-- I guess it is-- it's the battery
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.580]   part that connects to it.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.780]   But you wouldn't need a plug.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.860]   You could just place it or charge it.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   Charge up the little battery thing.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   You're right.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.860]   I'm going to want that charged.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   Never mind.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   Would you ever-- I mean, if your couch is just always going to be there, you might as well
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.860]   just have it plugged in and out of the way.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.540]   Yeah, you might as well have your couch plugged in.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.460]   I'm old enough to remember when they had these things that you could buy for the couch
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.820]   to put over the arm with two pockets, one for the clicker, as we called it.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.820]   We old people.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.820]   And one for the TV guy.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.820]   Yes.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.820]   Oh.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.100]   You know, you can still buy those to put on your bed.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.060]   If your bedside table, you stick it underneath your mattress and then you have this little
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.900]   pocket-- they still sell those generally.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.060]   For your phone?
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.860]   It's for whatever you want to stick in the pocket.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   Oh, OK.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   And do they still sell--
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.340]   Especially maids on these ones here in Whiskey.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.340]   Do they still sell TV guide?
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.380]   Oh, it's bigger now.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.380]   OK.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.380]   And print?
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   Yeah, it's a full-size magazine.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.380]   Fancy.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.380]   Wow.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.380]   Moving on.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.380]   It was timey.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.180]   It was like a little journal size thing.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:05.740]   As it sometimes says on my lower third, former TV guide critic, tell me you've got at least
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.340]   one copy of the TV guide framed in your house.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.340]   OK.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   The first-- I was promoted on the cover for my first issue.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.460]   There was a Roseanne cover as Lucille Ball.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.500]   And then there was a little thing.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.460]   Me to our new TV critic.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.460]   Nice.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.460]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.540]   You and Roseanne sharing space.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.540]   Wow, that--
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.540]   Wow.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.500]   --that was a six degrees of Jeff and Roseanne.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.940]   As she blocks me on Twitter, I just--
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.940]   --just find.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.700]   You should take a picture of the cover and be like, see, we've got a lot of--
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.700]   Hey, new?
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   You should know.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.060]   Let's take a break and thank the sponsor.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.460]   And then we can come back and talk about a whole lot more.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.900]   We've got a bunch of stuff that we have not even touched yet.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.700]   A whole doc full of stories that we're going to get to.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.340]   But first, this episode of This Week in Google
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.420]   is brought to you by Monday.com.

[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.980]   to specific day-to-day tasks.

[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.700]   and then trim it back or tailor it to your team's workflow.

[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.420]   that can be pretty burdensome in day-to-day use Excel files,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.820]   whiteboards, excessively long meetings.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.220]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.140]   Monday.com keeps you on track.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.820]   It creates accountability by assigning owners

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.860]   feel like they have it nailed.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.820]   Monday.com app is worth working with.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.020]   And you start to realize it kind of opens up
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.220]   the field of opportunity for how you can customize it
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.180]   around your workflow and jump right in,

[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.620]   I just put up the second link I put up in the chat.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.260]   Stacy, I know you're going to order this tonight,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.180]   immediately for your day core at home.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.300]   I know you're going to want this.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.220]   Oh, that is a link.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.900]   Where is it?
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.620]   Holy cow, man.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.620]   It's the second link.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.060]   I know it's Amazon.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.140]   That link is like a paragraph.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.500]   Half a page.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.060]   Where is it?
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.500]   Which chatter am I supposed to be in?
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.540]   In the chat on the rundown.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.460]   The doc chat.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.700]   Oh, man.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.260]   OK, so--
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:34.780]   Sorry.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.980]   John--
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.780]   There I put it in the chat chat.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.540]   There we go.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.300]   That is beautiful.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.820]   That is gorgeous.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.140]   And only $20 is the San Lee chair cover, which
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.700]   has a TV remote control holder, armrest organizer,
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.220]   sofa chair protector with five pocket armchair caddy.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.700]   Jump up in there.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.300]   What are you suggesting is plastic--
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   And--
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.780]   It's water resistant, which means I bet it's case
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.060]   so resistant.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.300]   Case so resistant, yes.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.340]   And it comes with gray.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.020]   Perfect.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.660]   You've got a place for your sunglasses,
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.980]   for when you're sitting in your chair
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980]   and you need to put your sunglasses--
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   Perfect for an--
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.980]   It's perfect for an--
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980]   It's not come off.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.660]   The sunglasses don't come off.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.660]   It's for your normal glasses if you need to switch to this.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.380]   That makes more sense.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.060]   No, he's too vain to wear those.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.340]   That's why they're in the chair pocket.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.060]   I don't think a vain person has one of these chair cover
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.820]   things either.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.100]   No.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.260]   You're probably right.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.140]   Wow, that thing.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.740]   Especially not in the coffee color.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.660]   Like I could maybe understand the gray.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.580]   It's quite sophisticated.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.940]   The beige is looking pretty as well.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.180]   The thing is $20 too expensive.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.900]   Actually, there's a coupon to save an extra 10%
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.660]   so we can--
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.540]   It's not enough.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.620]   We can knock a couple of dollars off that price for you.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.700]   What's it going to take to get you into one of these things,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.460]   Sam?
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.260]   As we always get leo to buy this on the show,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.860]   I think you should buy this.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.340]   Anastasia.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.940]   Yes, exactly.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.820]   You could review it on Hands on Tech.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.580]   That would be no.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.740]   It's kind of technology.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.140]   It holds technology really.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.220]   You know what you could do?
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.900]   You could put the--
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.220]   Google needs to make a jacquard version of one of these.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.340]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340]   There you go.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.540]   Oh, OK, I'm charging.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.060]   Yeah, see, that's the whole thing.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.860]   Oh, and then it's like a retrofit for my furniture.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.340]   You could think of yourself as Captain Kirk.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.580]   I do think of myself as Captain Kirk, often, actually.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   Not touching that.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.180]   Perfect.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.180]   It's a match, man.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.180]   I love it.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.180]   I love it.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.180]   I'm back.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.180]   Normal programming.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.180]   So funny.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:48.380]   I didn't know that existed until just now, and now I'm frightened.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.820]   I know the last time I was on, we talked about Google Pixel 4
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.860]   leaks because, man, we've known everything about this phone
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.820]   for so long now that I kind of feel like showing new renders
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.500]   of the phone, it really doesn't matter anymore.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.980]   We know exactly what it looks like.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.540]   We know exactly what it offers.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.460]   But what has happened over the course of the last week is,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.140]   and especially 9 to 5 Google, I feel like, is leading the charge.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.940]   They are, and then XDA have posted a number of exclusives being
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:20.140]   pulled from these Pixel 4s, which maybe I should actually start
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.700]   with the fact that somebody is selling Pixel 4 demo units for $1,200.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.220]   So if anyone wants to get into the pre-release, pre-announcement
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.780]   Pixel 4 leak game--
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   For a mere $1,200.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:37.100]   For a mere $1,200, you can go and buy from online shady sellers.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.820]   I'm assuming a lot of the other people that have leaks.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.460]   Is that what they did?
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.620]   Well, no, Google put out a lot of stuff,
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.980]   and then they released a lot of stuff in their code.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.020]   But then, I guess, maybe.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.580]   Well, yeah, all the people that have the actual device
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.260]   and have been showing it off, I'm really fascinated to know
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.020]   how that happened, or how it continues to happen.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.220]   I can still say Marketing 201 at Cal State
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.940]   Furloughton, or wherever University you are.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.340]   That's just Google Marketing.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.260]   I still believe that.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.940]   I don't believe in the whole supply chain leak.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.580]   This is Google just--
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.300]   Oh, no, the supply chain totally can leak.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   And you can see it when you talk to different companies.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:25.460]   If I talk to a chip supplier, if you mention Apple,
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.460]   nothing.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.900]   But if you talk about other companies,
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.180]   they'll talk about all kinds of crazy features coming out.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.500]   So there is very much a fear of God component
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.940]   to some of these things.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.260]   Google probably just doesn't have the--
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.180]   And they don't have the market share either.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.140]   I mean, if you're canceled from the Pixel 4,
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.340]   it's not like it's going to sell--
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.220]   All the reason why I believe Google's pushing it out
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.420]   themselves.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.700]   They don't have the market share.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.460]   Just push it on out and embrace these leaks, if you will,
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.540]   which is what they've done for the last couple months.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.460]   They've gotten tons of free publicity, and you're right.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.420]   In a way, they get more than one day's publicity.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.300]   They've gotten three weeks of everything
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.460]   you want to know about it.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.140]   That's not so dumb.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.060]   All right, so by the time the announcement happens,
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.620]   though, we will have been hearing about this phone
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.140]   and seeing official press images from Google
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.100]   like a couple of months ago.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.340]   We saw the official, you know, like, yeah, that's it.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.020]   And they posted the back of the phone.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.380]   So we will have already known about this phone for three
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.260]   solid months.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.100]   The keynote's going to be about two minutes long.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.020]   And actually happens.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.620]   The keynote's probably going to be the same length it always is.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.340]   So it's like, yeah, never mind the fact
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.180]   that you know everything.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.900]   Here's everything again.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.660]   You've ever been bingo cards.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.740]   That's what we need to make before the 15th, right?
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.260]   Oh.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.620]   Let's do it, man.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.900]   I like it.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.460]   I like it.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.540]   So does it have a headphone jack or no?
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.180]   No.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.940]   Oh, heck no.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:57.740]   They'll save that for the A version, if and when there is a 4A.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.420]   You know, at least that's what they did with a 3A.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.420]   They kept the headphone jack on there.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.500]   No headphone jack as far as I've seen in anything.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.740]   I think that's pretty certain.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.420]   That's not going to be there.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.660]   What we're seeing from 9 to 5 Google, though,
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.500]   are a number of leaks around kind of some of the software
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.780]   features that we're going to expect to find.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.540]   A Pixel Themes app, which actually the APK.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.460]   So someone who had this pre-release phone
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.140]   has gone in there and ripped out a bunch of APKs
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.380]   and published them online.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.820]   So you can actually use them in advance of the Pixel 4.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.500]   So the Pixel Themes app is embedded and integrated
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.180]   into the wallpaper.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.300]   When you tap and hold on the screen,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.740]   it gives you the wallpaper section.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.260]   And then in there is a styles like a theming section.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.540]   Actually, I forgot.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.020]   Oh.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.260]   I installed it so I could actually show you.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:52.620]   I don't know.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.820]   Do we have a new John?
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.100]   I forgot to even set that up.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   But you're such a rogue, Mr. Howell.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.540]   Yeah, my apologies.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.100]   I expected it not to work last night on the show.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.420]   And then for whatever reason, it ended up working.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.580]   So styles and wallpapers, if I go in there and down at the bottom,
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.500]   you can see the little style button.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.460]   And when I go over there, you can then go in here
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.340]   and theme just a bunch of different aspects of the last.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.420]   It looks like dark mode to me.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.500]   Yeah, it does look like dark mode, doesn't it?
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   I probably have it on right now, Jeff.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.580]   He's saving this matter.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.180]   I don't know.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.980]   I probably have it on right now.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.780]   You're going to get an extra 30 seconds of time today.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.300]   Congratulations.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.180]   Son Serif, Serif.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.020]   Oh my god.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.740]   XDA, we had Michelle Ramon on last night, editor in chief
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.340]   of XDA.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.020]   And he was saying that when this hits officially,
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.900]   there's going to be more options than just too far.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.700]   I like Serif.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.500]   That's cool.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.540]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.820]   The hell with Helvetica?
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.420]   And you know, there will be more icon options right now.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.620]   It doesn't really give me much.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   All right.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.140]   You hate Serif's too, us, Daisy?
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.420]   I'm now just going to be in opposition
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.580]   on all of these insignificant things.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.340]   I'm just going to be like, yes, I am--
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.940]   Ro Helvetica.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.420]   Your time's to Romanish.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.340]   What are the opposite of what he just said?
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.740]   Helvetica, Stacy.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.500]   So--
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.220]   I thought a documentary, what's your font kit?
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:18.820]   Nothing.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.860]   Yeah, Helvetica.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   And if there is no documentary for that font,
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.420]   that's opportunity right there.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.940]   I think you should be the one to make it happen.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.420]   So we're going to see theming.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.420]   Another thing that just posted right before showtime
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.580]   was a bunch of videos that I'm not really quite sure
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.700]   what the backstory is, but the videos from Google,
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.460]   as far as what the new Google Assistant on the Pixel 4
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.780]   is going to be-- we saw a little bit of it at Google I/O,
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   how if you remember the woman went on stage
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.700]   and just did this constant stream of actions,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.780]   talking to the phone, and it was doing all these things,
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.020]   and blooping, and blipping all around,
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:59.340]   and with no pausing to wait for it to catch up or whatever.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.740]   And it was definitely a big moment.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.140]   But what happens when there's thousands of people
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.060]   making it that request?
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.900]   Well, no, no, no, no, that's the beauty of it.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:09.780]   It's all on device.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.700]   It's all on device.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.060]   OK.
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   And that was part of what they were saying months ago
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.460]   is that the next Pixel phone will be capable of doing that.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.420]   So I'm wondering if some of the hardware in there,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.540]   they've shrunk down the data set to allow for it
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.900]   to be stored on the device.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.540]   Maybe the hardware makes some of this stuff even faster,
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   zero latency, that sort of stuff.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.820]   But is this enough to get those Samsung customers?
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.100]   Is this enough?
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.020]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.980]   What can Google do?
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.300]   What do you have there, Jeff?
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.260]   What am I looking at?
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.260]   It has long--
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.260]   Type specimen.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:49:03.380]   Type
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:14.100]   But do you have a font set framed now?
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.660]   I have a-- oh, no, that's from the Spy Museum, not the New
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.180]   Museum.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:22.740]   I was like, I have a picture of a poster with a sans-serif font.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.460]   Sort of.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.900]   Yeah, that's a half point, I'd say.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.860]   Yeah, half point.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.860]   OK.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.860]   I do.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.540]   So am that right.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.180]   I don't know why, but I'm feeling very ambitious tonight.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.020]   You are punchy.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.020]   I'm enjoying the punchy, Jeff.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.020]   I have too.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.220]   So did-- I don't know if we've talked-- well, I'm pretty
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.060]   sure we didn't talk about that because I actually was paying
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:45.540]   attention.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:51.420]   But did you guys see the leak about voice transcription
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.180]   on the Pixel 4?
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.820]   Because I was like, I would like that now, please.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.340]   Oh, no.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:55.820]   Which is--
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.340]   Oh, yes, it is.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.060]   --is that mentioned.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.660]   Yeah, it automatically transcribes your voice memos
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.340]   and turns them into searchable content.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.580]   Isn't that already on 10, Android 10?
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.540]   So you're talking about the recorder app, right?
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.300]   Yeah, the native app.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.020]   I'll go ahead and show it.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.580]   This is my tool for the--
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.460]   Oh, I'm sorry?
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.060]   No, no, don't be sorry.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.540]   It's the name of it.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.980]   I'm actually excited by this.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.180]   It is actually really cool.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.380]   So this was one of the APKs that was leaked from Pixel 4.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.980]   It's called a recorder.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.620]   And it is a voice recorder.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.900]   When you hit the record, it starts recording.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.220]   You can see up there, it's detected what I'm saying
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:37.980]   as speech, right?
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.820]   That's the waveform for it.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:44.660]   As I showed last night on the show, if I whistle,
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.260]   it picks up whistling.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.580]   It's able to determine different types of audio.
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.100]   And there's a list of things that it can actually determine.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.180]   I think even like--
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.220]   It bark like a dog.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.660]   Let's see what it does.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.700]   Oh, clapping is also nice.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.820]   No, clapping is not.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.540]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.340]   Clapping doesn't work.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.700]   What about barking like a dog?
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.180]   [GASPS]
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.220]   Oh, no, that's laughter.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.220]   OK, laughter.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:11.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.460]   OK, it doesn't pick up fake laughter.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.020]   I love it.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.260]   But anyways, I go over to transcripts.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.740]   And everything that I've said has been turned into text.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.220]   And it's doing it in real time because, again, this
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.380]   is all happening on device.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.940]   Device and not in the cloud.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.140]   And not in the cloud, which is just unbelievable.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.580]   So if I stop this, go ahead and save that.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.140]   I could add tags and stuff like that.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.860]   And then if I go up to it, everything that I have
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.820]   is saved here, which allows me to-- let me pick out a word--
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.740]   laughter.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.540]   So I'll go ahead and search--
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.300]   oh, sorry.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.580]   I didn't realize you're up close.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.260]   Laugh.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.180]   Let's see here, laughter.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.700]   And then if I search that, it takes me to the point in the audio
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.300]   that laughter was spoken.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.380]   Oh!
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.340]   Wow.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.660]   No, no, that's laughter, OK?
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.580]   Oh, what this does for reporters?
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.340]   Oh, yes, yes.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.740]   Totally.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.060]   It's actually really cool.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.700]   That's why I was reading about this and I'm like, oh, crap.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.660]   I should have bought the four.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.300]   Now my daughter's going to get the 3A.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   Sorry.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.220]   There's only being the four.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:20.940]   What does it need?
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.380]   The processing power or the four?
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.020]   Well, I don't know.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.420]   I'm running on my 3XL.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.940]   And it seems to work pretty well.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.500]   So I'm going to say no.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.700]   I mean, I don't know if Google is going to intend
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.580]   for it to only be on the four.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.260]   But the APK is--
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.380]   Is that there in the wild?
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.700]   I don't get it.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.620]   Yeah, I'd go get it.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.180]   Yeah, down like a 10 year.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.380]   Yeah, you can go to apkmirror.com.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.420]   That's the site that is owned and operated
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.540]   by the folks at Android Police, so you can trust it.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.820]   And they have the APK posted there for you to download.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.100]   And as it gets updated, they will refresh it there as well.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100]   But that's where I got it.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.900]   I'd like to see this in the wild, like at CES.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.260]   We have all this extra ambient noise.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.140]   And you have the noise canceling mic on there.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.860]   But I just want to test it out and see how well it does.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.180]   Because this a lot of times, you're recording your person,
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.260]   you interview him or whatever, and you have to write it out.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.140]   And sometimes the recording sounds bad.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.020]   And you're trying to remember what exactly did they say?
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.460]   You think they said, I'm curious to see how that translates.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.700]   How many people do you have in the studio?
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.540]   You don't take physical notes?
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.780]   I do sometimes.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.140]   Not only time, but I do.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.580]   I was like, what?
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.140]   Yeah, I mean, I'm reading over my transcript here.
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.020]   It might not be perfect, but it's pretty darn close.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.140]   That same person has come so far with this stuff.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.660]   It's really unbelievable.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.740]   Now, when you translate it back into another language, though.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.820]   Not that I can tell.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.980]   Still don't use this at the border.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.140]   No.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.260]   For clearing people coming into the country.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.700]   I'd like to use it for recording podcasts remotely.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:59.140]   Just another audio recorder.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:53:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:00.300]   Right.
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:00.620]   Right.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.540]   And then you can kind of search in if you need to find out
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.580]   what the time code is for that particular edit or whatever.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.660]   Jump to it.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.460]   Pretty neat stuff.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.980]   And then you can also upload to Google Drive if you--
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.300]   Shut cap and hold it.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   Share it to your drive.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.540]   That drive integration.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:17.980]   Yep.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.460]   Of course.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.300]   Big surprise.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.260]   Welcome to Google.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.220]   Another cool feature coming to Pixel phones
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:30.020]   will be emergency detection for when you might
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.460]   have been in a car crash.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:31.940]   That's great.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.500]   So the emergency information app
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.180]   is going to update to the personal safety app.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.380]   And car crash detection, essentially,
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.900]   it's going to be running if it detects
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.940]   based on your sensors and your accelerometer readings
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.220]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:52.660]   If it detects that you have most likely been involved
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.580]   in a car crash, it will give you the opportunity
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:56.580]   to call 911.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:01.140]   So you can't imagine how would know that versus a fast stop?
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.620]   So I'm going to let you--
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.220]   like Uber also is doing this.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.580]   It has a feature called Ride Check.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.060]   And it uses your GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope,
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.700]   and stuff in your phone for the same thing.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.260]   It's called Ride Check.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.780]   So I expect to see this on lots of things coming up.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.900]   And it's actually kind of cool.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.380]   Yeah, I want to know the threshold is.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.860]   Although if you've got two people in the car running this,
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.580]   is each phone going to call 911?
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:30.420]   Or how are we going to reconcile things like that?
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.660]   And if you think about it, my phone already asks,
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.460]   if I'm trying to play something from Spotify and I'm in a car,
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.820]   it's like, are you in the car?
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.500]   And it'll switch to auto mode.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.100]   And I'm like, I'm not driving.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.740]   Please let me control it the way I want.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.940]   I wonder what the threshold is though,
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.940]   because just like you said, if you're in traffic somewhere,
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:55.100]   you have sudden stops, but not necessarily an impact.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.300]   So they're using machine learning.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.100]   So my hunch is they have enough actual impact data
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.540]   that they can differentiate between what happens
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.260]   at a pretty granular level.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.100]   And I imagine sometimes they're going to be wrong.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.100]   Right.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.580]   Uber's only gives you that.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.580]   I think it just gives you the option to call 911.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.940]   You get-- oh, yeah.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.260]   It says you get a notification will pop up and be like,
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.940]   hey, are you all right?
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:22.940]   Yes.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.380]   And that's what you get here.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:28.260]   Essentially, it would sound at tone at the loudest volume
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.660]   and then asks if you need help in that moment.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.500]   Do you need help?
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.260]   And you could then say, yes, I need help or call 911
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:35.740]   or whatever.
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.540]   And then it would do it for you.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.980]   But if you say nothing, what happens?
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.940]   That's a great question.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.540]   I actually don't know the answer to that.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.260]   It might be in the article and I missed it.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.260]   But that's important.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.700]   We need for the story where someone gets a heart attack.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.460]   Nothing happened, but the sirens come rushing to them.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.620]   That's what gives them a heart attack and they die.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.860]   If they Google went up like--
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.140]   If no response is provided, it picks a little proceed
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:00.660]   to automatically down 911 and share your location.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.180]   OK.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:01.860]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.100]   That's so I will tell you my mom,
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.020]   when I was a very young child, had an ectopic pregnancy
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.140]   while she was driving to work.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.060]   And that means that it's in the wrong space in your body
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.540]   and it just explodes.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.860]   And you bleed to death internally, basically.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.220]   And she was driving a car and she was losing blood
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:20.340]   and she passed out and ran into a guardrail.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.740]   And it was like five in the morning.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.460]   So someone did see in call because she lives in Houston.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.740]   But it was early enough that it's possible that my mom could
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:30.380]   have led to death.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.340]   So something like this is actually kind of awesome.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:33.860]   That is.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.700]   Yeah, it is.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.540]   And there was news, Google, published news.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.780]   I can't remember when this was probably like a month
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.380]   or a month and a half ago.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:45.300]   Something about calling emergency services
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.020]   without using your voice.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.660]   Because if I remember correctly, it had something to do with,
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.860]   like if you're in a situation where you can't speak,
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.860]   but you still need help, you'll be able to use your phone
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.740]   to call some emergency services.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.660]   I want to say that would be baked in here.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:00.700]   Maybe that would be baked in here.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.420]   Like if people were being held up.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.300]   I do remember seeing that.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.580]   That's exactly it.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.220]   So I wonder if that's going to be kind of rolled into this
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:08.740]   as well.
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.980]   Another feature of this is a quick sharing of emergency status
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:12.980]   with select contacts.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:19.740]   So like you were saying, if you made no response, calls 911,
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.980]   but then it also pings whatever contacts
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:26.020]   you've identified as like emergency contacts to let them know.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.860]   Of course, Google has all the backend stuff
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.700]   to make phone calls for us now.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.660]   So I'm sure it's probably really good at notifying.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.740]   Oh my gosh.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.140]   And it could possibly get through do not disturbs too.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.740]   Like in that situation, I wouldn't
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.580]   want to have to call someone three times to be like,
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.900]   hi, I'm dying in a car accident.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.740]   Oh, right.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.380]   Right.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.460]   That would be really interesting.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.660]   Because right now we have so much infrastructure set up
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.300]   around not reaching people during certain times.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:50.780]   Please.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.300]   Although I know on my do not disturb,
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:56.340]   I have it set to allow starred contacts.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.220]   Surgeon contacts, OK.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.900]   And I wonder if Google would go so far as to override
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.060]   the do not disturb settings on someone's phone
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.900]   if they were marked as a--
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.660]   I think if you're going to call 911, you might as well.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.700]   I mean, I agree.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.300]   It's a pretty big call right there.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:17.860]   No, I completely agree.
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:22.420]   But that would supersede someone's specific instruction
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.100]   to say only let calls through undo not disturb
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.340]   in this particular scenario.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.460]   Maybe there should be a setting in there or something
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.620]   to allow them to opt in, I suppose.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.540]   But I completely agree.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.700]   In case of emergency, they probably go on and out.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.540]   So there you go.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.300]   But anyways, I love this feature.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:40.900]   I think it's--
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:41.900]   All right, especially because--
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.300]   Especially for my new master, they're going to save lives.
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.060]   Absolutely.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.940]   And I mean, these are features that you find in like OnStar,
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:49.660]   that sort of stuff.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.060]   And that requires a monthly fee.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.820]   So it does.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.420]   Something very similar to that.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.220]   And just kind of baked into Pixel phone.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.180]   So another feature of having a Pixel, I guess.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.260]   And if there's too many false positives,
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.420]   you could see something happen.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.700]   Like a lot of municipalities, for example, only give you like two
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.180]   or three free responses to emergency things.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.220]   So like if ADT calls, if it's a false positive
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.300]   and they send out the police, they'll
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.780]   search charging you after a certain point in time.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.660]   So I guess we could see something like this
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.300]   if there's a lot of false positives.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.020]   I'm pretty sure Google's probably pretty good at figuring
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:28.900]   this out though.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.900]   And then finally, if you've been waiting for the day
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.460]   that Google would update its Pixel Buds, apparently.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.860]   Well, actually, actually, I was thinking about getting some
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.100]   buds and I went to Best Buy.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.380]   And I said, no, Jeff, hold on.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.580]   There's an event coming up.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.700]   Right.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.780]   And I thought maybe they'll improve these suckers
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.140]   and they'll be good.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.780]   Only one person that loved those things.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.300]   Only one person loved them.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.380]   And that's because they had funky ears.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.020]   It's about the best way I could describe it.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.100]   I didn't feel like they fit my ears very well.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.620]   Ron Richards on all that Android.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.980]   He actually loves them.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.780]   So I see people.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.780]   I can't wear those.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.420]   I cannot do earbuds.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.340]   They just fall right out.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.620]   I don't have a problem with earbuds most of these.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:19.140]   Have you changed the smallest setting?
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.860]   The little loop-de-loop thing?
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.380]   Well, no, I was going to say, have you actually
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.140]   used the custom earbud things?
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.220]   Do you actually customize them?
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.300]   Oh, the tips.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.660]   I've changed the tips on some.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.900]   I changed the tips.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.020]   Oh, OK.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.860]   I had a friend who was like, they never fit me in.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.860]   I asked them, but they were like, oh.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.060]   Wait, does it do that?
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.260]   Well, those things I should say--
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.860]   Things that just kind of hang in your ear, impossible.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.860]   Uh-huh.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.380]   Impossible.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:45.380]   OK.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.660]   What do you have on that?
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.540]   Oh, these are just little white earbuds.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.220]   I don't even-- I think I pulled them out of my drawer of tricks
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.660]   because I didn't want my big, heavy ones.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.860]   But there are two new buds out, the Microsoft ones
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.780]   from this morning.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.980]   Yep.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.300]   And the Amazon buds that bring you
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.700]   Madam A in your ear from last week,
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.780]   and then presumably the new ones.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.620]   So there's a cornucopia of buds.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.860]   I love that you did that.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.780]   You're making the segue.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.940]   It was easy.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.140]   Stacey.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:14.700]   How about this?
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.420]   Let's thank the sponsor.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.300]   And then we will come back.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.700]   We'll talk about Amazon.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.780]   We will talk about this morning's Microsoft event.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.620]   And was on set with Micah this morning.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.300]   With one eye open, trying to stay away.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.740]   It was a little early.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.740]   It's OK.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.340]   You get up really early these days.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:33.980]   So it's all right.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.700]   It's no big deal.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.500]   And then of course, Stacey, you were at the Amazon event.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.980]   So follow up following.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.660]   There are questions for you, Stacey.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.820]   I wait to hear your reaction to the things.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.340]   Lots.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.140]   I can't wait either.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.940]   Of things to discuss after this break.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.180]   This episode of This Week in Google
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.660]   is brought to you by Captera.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.980]   Captera is so cool.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.180]   It's the leading free online resource

[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.700]   And you start going through the category list.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:26.660]   You're going to see just how detailed and specific it can get.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:32.260]   And you didn't even realize there was software specifically for computer repair shops
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:36.780]   or conflict checking software or consignment software.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.820]   We're just in the Cs.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.500]   We're in a small part of the Cs right now.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.460]   That's what you're going to find there.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.060]   Hop on down.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.780]   Yes, I'm following whatever you're pulling up there, Joe.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.500]   Employee scheduling, of course, there's plenty of software
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.580]   for that, emissions management all across the board.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.260]   Just jump in there and find a category.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.340]   And you'll be amazed at just how much software exists there.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.340]   And then, of course, the tools at Captera for comparing them.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.900]   Finding a few is great.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.540]   But what if you want to know feature by feature what something has,
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:10.140]   you know, piece of software has, or even features that you didn't even know existed,
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.620]   how they rate, that's what it's all about.

[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.620]   Captera is software selection simplified.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:39.060]   And we thank Captera for their support.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.820]   So do we begin with Microsoft because it was this morning?
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.580]   It's the freshest.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.020]   I feel like there was a big surprise in the Microsoft announcement this morning
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.900]   that we're a couple at the very end, right?
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.180]   Yeah, right there at the very end.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:57.580]   They did their whole one more thing, but I think it was more like a 1.1 thing.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.220]   It was one more thing, and then what did he go off stage,
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.940]   and then he came back and was like, "Oh, actually, there's another thing."
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.340]   He literally said, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.460]   As if, "All right, that's in the story."
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:12.340]   And then we get the Neo, which is a beautiful dual display device,
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.940]   but the Duo, right, after that, that was quite a surprise.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.220]   Quite a surprise.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:26.980]   And we've been hearing for a long time now that Microsoft is just out of the mobile phone game.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.460]   Allegedly, they all do.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:32.060]   Allegedly, didn't really work for them, so they kind of, you know,
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.020]   back to the drawing board, apparently.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.980]   And so the Duo is actually running Android, right?
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:41.180]   That's part of the reason that we would talk about this on this show.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.660]   What did you think?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.300]   It kind of seems like we know very little about it at this point, right?
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:52.460]   Again, I'm going to go on record, as I said, in the live stream that we had here on the network.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.220]   The Duo, I'm not sold on it because I'm just not ready for the foldable phone.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.420]   I just don't see where that fits in my workflow.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:03.100]   I know there's some people that think having the extra screens in their pocket
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.540]   is just giving them a smaller version of a tablet,
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.380]   but I just can't get into it.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.500]   I do like the fact that the screen is not foldable itself.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.380]   There's a space in between the hinges,
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:19.740]   so you don't have to deal with what Samsung was dealing with for $2,200 device.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.540]   That's going to eventually wear out, regardless of how many times they tested it in their lab.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.100]   So you got that going for it.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.340]   But the Neo on the other hand, I totally dig that.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:31.900]   I totally dig that.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.660]   Now, the Neo is not Android.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.700]   This is not Android.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:34.940]   Not Android.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.220]   Windows 10 only.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:36.540]   Right.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.580]   Oh, 10X, sorry.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.100]   What about it has you?
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.140]   Because you're getting productivity out of it.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:49.580]   You have the dual screens, but you can have basically a smaller laptop, if you will.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.220]   You get your extra keyboard that pulls out that's magnetically attached to it.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.620]   It can slide to give you an extra touch bar, like what?
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:06.140]   Mac had on the MacBook Pros, the touch bar, but it's actually useful in not getting in the way.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.220]   So is it a tablet?
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:08.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.180]   The Neo is a tablet or is it a laptop?
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.660]   The Neo is a tablet with an attached keyboard.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.220]   Right.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:14.860]   Right.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.860]   But it's just small enough.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:21.820]   Now, the way they demoed it in the keynote is they were holding it more like a book.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.020]   I don't necessarily--
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.700]   They were holding it like a book.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.500]   I don't like that.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:31.340]   Give it more of a clamshell productivity form.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   And they caught it a posture.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.260]   That's what they kept saying during the keynote.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:35.900]   Posture.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.860]   If you set it up more like a laptop, I think it's a great device for about
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:43.340]   a nine-- I think it was a nine-inch display.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:43.580]   Okay.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:49.420]   But the phone, the duo, nice that they're jumping in with the Android world and trying to get that
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.900]   market share, but it's not for me.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.060]   But they went to great lengths, from what I understand, to not call it a phone, right?
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:56.620]   What?
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.180]   No, they--
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.220]   Why?
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:58.380]   Why?
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.020]   Maybe because there's still more development.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:01.980]   Okay.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.500]   This isn't coming out until like holiday of 2020.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.220]   2020, correct.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.020]   This is the way it's out.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.980]   That's like a full year.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:16.140]   I give them credit for not rushing into it the way other OEMs have, but it's nice to just wait.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:21.260]   Early preview, a little more than a year from now.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:28.780]   The version that they were showing has a Snapdragon 855, which is this year's nearly top of the line.
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.340]   It was top of the line until the 855+ came out.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:36.140]   So, you know, if they stick with that and it comes out next year,
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.220]   running into the complaints of like--
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.660]   But again, this is a non-production version.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.060]   It's a total.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.620]   It's a total.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.220]   Hopefully that would upgrade.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:44.620]   Bye then.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.220]   Mike, like, I totally agree.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:54.540]   Like, I'm not a big fan of the foldable technology the way it is now,
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:58.460]   because from a fragility standpoint, things are so fragile.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.220]   You spend too much money for that, the break.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.180]   At the same time, the scene down the middle is really nice when you're using it for productivity,
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.780]   but don't watch a movie like that.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.260]   No.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.980]   I guarantee you it's just not going to be fun seeing that line through the middle of your movie.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.220]   I liked with the Neo.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.900]   They had the dockable options.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:20.940]   If you're running Windows 10, you're used to pinning windows along your display.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:26.940]   But you can do this with the Neo and put it down that lower-tiered screen just above your keyboard
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:31.740]   and hop back up to the main display and take notes or what have you,
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.860]   based on what you're seeing down or just above your keyboard.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.980]   I think that's just perfect use cases, not just,
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.980]   oh, it's a pretty display there.
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.820]   You actually get in some use out of that extra real estate right there.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.740]   Do you think it will fair better than the touch bar has on the MacBook price?
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.220]   Clearly.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:50.860]   Night and day.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:51.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.140]   Night and day.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.540]   Now, Granite Microsoft was showing it off with a bunch of emojis and things of that nature,
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.060]   but which you could do on the touch bar.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:58.860]   Whatever.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.340]   You know.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.500]   And I feel like the touch bar hasn't quite lived up to what people know.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.220]   What Apple probably expected that it would.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.460]   No, but it's a neat idea.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.980]   But yeah, so I'm interested in that.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.660]   And then of course, surface buds, this kind of ties back in with what we're talking about before the break.
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.540]   The surface buds, a lot of people didn't like the aesthetics.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.260]   When we were looking into live chat, it's like a big circle over here.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.340]   They look like, what do you call those?
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:25.980]   Gages.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.380]   Uh-huh.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.020]   Yes, they do.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.060]   They're like, just that people wear.
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:28.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.260]   Yes, they do.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:34.860]   But people tend to forget that when the Apple AirPods came out, they took a lot of flak from
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.140]   the way they looked too.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.340]   And they still look weird.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.380]   And sorry.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.940]   People love them.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.980]   But people love them.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.900]   So this is like an etiquette thing maybe.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:49.100]   But like I noticed that my husband has the AirPods and I can always tell when they're in his ears.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.780]   So that's nice.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.940]   I try not to talk to him when he has them in his ears.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.020]   Now I have the Jabra.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.900]   Oh, look, they're right here.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.100]   I have the little Jabra things.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.940]   And when I put them in my ears, you can't actually see that there's anything in my ears
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.140]   because my hair is in the way too.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.540]   OK.
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.620]   So he has, he never knows to talk to me or not.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.820]   You know, he's just constantly.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:08.300]   Sorry, he's just safe.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.220]   That has nothing to do with the AirPods.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:10.700]   Sorry.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.580]   That's your excuse.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.100]   You ignore them all the time.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.500]   I know.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.780]   I know how it is the husband.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.340]   I get it.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.100]   You just, oh, no, my AirPods.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:17.820]   I'm listening to you.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.060]   Sure.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:18.380]   But I.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:23.100]   So yeah, he has this weird thing where he'll walk up real close to being like,
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.460]   peers over into my ears.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.740]   And I'm like, what is happening?
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:31.740]   But that design is really helpful because it's also nice for people like if you're,
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.900]   if you have them in like why you're trying to shop or something, you can see them.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.300]   Right.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.420]   They don't hide.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.900]   It's like a visible do not disturb mode.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.700]   And there's a question like.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.340]   That's a purpose when you're playing.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.940]   Should should you be wearing them all the time?
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.580]   Maybe not.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.060]   But yeah.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.540]   I don't mind that design.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.700]   I think it's good to be obvious in that situation.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:57.740]   Yeah. That's not a bad place for it to be obvious when you're listening to something.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.780]   Sometimes that's why people put earphones on to begin with.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.380]   Whether they're listening to something or not.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:02.860]   I do.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:03.340]   I do.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.860]   And I want to be alone, right?
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.420]   I do.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:05.900]   With my thoughts.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.100]   You're okay.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.980]   A confession moment.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.620]   Do you ever not want to talk to anybody?
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.420]   So you put it in your buds, but you're not actually listening to anything?
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:13.660]   Yes.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.060]   Yes.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:16.380]   Totally.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.940]   This is the line of introverts.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:19.900]   What are you saying?
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.740]   None of us want to talk to people.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:27.420]   But sometimes I just walk around with a scowl on my face and no one talks to me.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.540]   Oh, well, that does it.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:32.940]   So in our office, actually, I have big over ear headphones.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:36.540]   And I don't necessarily put them on because I don't want to talk to people.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.700]   But I put them on because I can concentrate.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.820]   Isolation was always out.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.300]   Isolation was always out.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.380]   Notice the dynamic here.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.860]   Jason's trying to say to his office roommate.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.060]   I'm not ignoring you.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.500]   And if you catch me with no sound on, it's not an insult.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.300]   Really, it's not.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.180]   I'm just meditating.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.060]   Let's put it this way.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.980]   I did it long before you got into the office.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.700]   Wow.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.380]   But I just feel it's almost like putting on white noise for me.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:07.580]   Like sometimes wearing earphones and especially the over ears because they kind of like block out all sound.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:12.380]   For me, it's like a vacuum that sucks out the noise from the house.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.180]   So that I can focus on what I'm reading.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.860]   And I get that.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.820]   I get that.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.060]   You know, but I enjoy being interrupted.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.980]   It'd be anytime you like that.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.580]   I have officially been here for.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.340]   I think you love me come over and tap him on the shoulder.
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:27.740]   Right?
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.940]   That's probably his favorite.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.420]   Hell, I don't.
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.420]   I've officially been here for one month.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.180]   That honeymoon is clearly over now.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:33.500]   Right?
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.260]   Oh, hey, yeah.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.260]   And don't bother me.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.300]   No headphones are on.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:45.660]   Now, the pricing of those surface buds, they're listing that 249.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.940]   You can get them in at the end of the year, holiday season.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.060]   I believe is what they said.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:50.780]   Surprised to you.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:57.180]   But that's expensive, but I wonder if it lives up to the, you know,
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:02.060]   forest audio quality and then you have all the other gesture controls and what not built into it.
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.500]   Will it work well with Android?
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.860]   I mean, it's yes.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.420]   All the OK G stuff and all that.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.860]   Oh, right.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.940]   I don't know about the voice assistants.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.460]   Voice assistants.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:14.460]   And you activate a voice assistant.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:14.700]   Yes.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:14.940]   So.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.380]   Yep.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.580]   I could not.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.580]   Yeah, it works with a court or a choice.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.540]   Or Google assistant.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.860]   You have to use Willie or whatever.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.700]   What's what's Microsoft's?
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.500]   I have Cortana.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.140]   Cortana.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:26.620]   Willie.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.060]   I wish it was Willie.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.500]   Hey, Willie.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:37.660]   Willie is a really good voice assistant.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.100]   No, they have to have three syllables, but Willie would be awesome.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.220]   Oh, I wish it was.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.660]   I wish it was.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:55.340]   It's Cortana, by comparison, a much more boring name.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:58.860]   But yes, it does support that.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.780]   It doesn't say anything about Siri.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.620]   So I wonder why.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.300]   Weird.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.180]   Weird.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:11.580]   And 250 for like true wireless earphones isn't actually really that expensive.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:12.940]   I mean, it's pricier.
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:16.620]   But again, but looking at the quality you get,
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.820]   that's what I want to know.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.380]   How will these things sound in my ears?
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.500]   Because you're paying a lot of money for those dad gum horrible beats by
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.900]   Dre headphones and all of that stuff.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.180]   This has to be a better value.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:36.780]   Sherlin Lowe from Engadget says that the sound quality is.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.980]   It says there.
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:40.540]   Let's see here.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:44.700]   I wouldn't go as far as to say their top notch quality, but I wasn't disappointed.
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.060]   So and she is in a crowded.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:48.860]   That's true.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.180]   Yes.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:49.500]   Right now.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.620]   She's in a crowd.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.380]   That's a pretty caveat of review right there.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:56.140]   Could go either way.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.060]   I think that just means way for our review.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:58.300]   Right.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.820]   We can actually listen to these in an environment that we can control and.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:06.940]   So the showroom floor with a bunch of grabby other journalists.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.220]   Yeah, totally, totally.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.620]   Okay, so that's Microsoft.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.500]   There were other things.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:18.140]   But I think we should also talk about Amazon because Amazon last week.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:23.580]   Had their big announcement with like 80,000 new products all running Alexa or sorry.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.820]   Madam a madam a madam a.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.020]   That was close.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.740]   I'm sure I fired one off anyways.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.980]   So what did you think Stacy?
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.180]   I actually already know because we talked to you on Tech News weekly,
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.100]   but what are some of your highlights?
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.860]   Okay.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.300]   Yeah, and I did a bad job on Tech News weekly because I didn't even get to like the cool
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:42.780]   gadgets.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.860]   I was so busy being excited about other stuff.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.500]   So I'm sorry.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.860]   No, that was great.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.180]   Okay.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.220]   So.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:55.100]   A week later having had time to process the biggest most exciting things for me.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.420]   Were Samuel L. Jackson because everybody wanted him.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.940]   Hands down.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.620]   In sound.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.540]   So they will replace Madam a with Samuel L. Jackson for 99 cents.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.740]   You get explicit or clean.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.260]   It's pretty cool.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.020]   I don't know.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:11.980]   Is that available now?
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:12.940]   Does anyone know?
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.060]   I don't know.
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.540]   I think I look at like two days afterwards,
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:21.900]   but I haven't looked at it wasn't there, but I haven't looked like today.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.420]   Coming soon as a.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.540]   Okay, still coming soon.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:25.340]   All right.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:25.740]   I think so.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.940]   You got some new Echo devices, new Echo Show, medium size, not great.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.140]   You got an Echo Dot with an alarm clock.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.900]   You got a tiny Echo device called a flex that plugs into an outlet
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.620]   and is like you could put Madam a anywhere in your house.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.460]   And it was the it's cheaper than an Echo Dot.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.340]   So if 30 bucks was too much, try 25.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.420]   And then and they're crazy.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.580]   Wish fulfillment.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.060]   I don't think they're crazy out there devices.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:04.780]   They introduced to one was the frames, which is an invitation only 179 99 pair of glasses
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:08.300]   that has Madam a integrated into the glasses.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.340]   There's no.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.020]   They look pretty clunky.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.900]   They're pictures.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.220]   So they're hipster glasses.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:14.860]   I pick them up.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.780]   They actually way less than my glasses.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.460]   I have.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.860]   Well, so I have some hipster glasses that are made of old press record vinyl.
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.580]   So that's.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.420]   No, do you.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:25.820]   Do you.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.580]   To him for wearing.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.180]   I do and I love them.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:29.580]   You guys.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.620]   Oh my gosh.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.380]   But so these are 31 grams.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:36.220]   So if you if you if you scratch them just the right way, it plays a tune.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:41.260]   Do you read you read you read you wait.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.220]   Okay.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:48.140]   Anyway, that is like that is like hipster at another level is some glasses made from.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.860]   You actually have your own.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.220]   I'm very happy road.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.460]   They're all bespoke.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.420]   So I'm just everyone is custom.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.660]   You don't get to choose your color on the inside.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:03.660]   You don't get to choose the artist that is printed on your glasses.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.180]   Anyway.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:05.420]   Okay.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.740]   We can all mock my glasses.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.140]   All right.
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.140]   All right.
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.180]   These glasses.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:09.340]   We are.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.220]   Which I really want.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.420]   You can publish an after we started.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.940]   I'm just rolling with it.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.740]   These I want.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:18.860]   I have applied for them.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:25.260]   I want them so badly because I really would like madam a to be accessible through a pair of
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.460]   classes that I wear all the time.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.580]   And they're not designed.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.860]   I would like it without the earbuds because I don't like wearing earbuds because then I can't
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.300]   hear the world around me.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.780]   So this feels kind of both safer and.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.100]   If you're sitting on a subway station.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.740]   Will the next person hear what you're hearing?
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.060]   No, it's very hard to hear.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.740]   I had to get up really uncomfortable close to a complete stranger to even hear that
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.940]   there was like something happening.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.500]   Ah, is it bone connection bone connection?
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.340]   No, it's not.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:53.820]   It's not.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.300]   It's not.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.180]   It's it's really well done.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.420]   Like, again, complete stranger.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.140]   I'm really sorry.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.420]   Whoever you were.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:01.820]   I'm like.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.340]   Hello, as I lead really far in.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:11.660]   So it's it's nice and they're lightweight.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.460]   And I like that they don't have the heads up display.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:22.140]   And the battery life is enough for like 90 notifications for about a day of intermittent
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.420]   madam a use.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.660]   It's only like 45 minutes of listening to music.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.180]   So this is not a replacement.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.020]   It's additive to something like earbuds.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.500]   And then the other thing they showed in the crazy device category was something called
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:38.540]   the loop, which is a fat ring that has both a microphone and a speaker.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:45.500]   And you can talk to your hand to be like, madam a add this to my list or what is the
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.660]   capital of Pennsylvania.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.420]   And then you cheat would tell you you can hold it.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.300]   You can hold it up to you.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.820]   Oh, no, you don't do that.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.140]   Really?
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.420]   Really.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:58.700]   They actually showed that and there's a video if you look for the video for the loop,
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.820]   the guy is like surreptitiously talking to it just like this.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.420]   And then he's like, I'm sorry.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:11.100]   I'll probably get I'll probably get fuzzed for this, but talk to the finger.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.500]   I was like, yeah, talk to the hand.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.060]   So that's a little cheaper.
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:17.420]   I don't see why you would want that.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:19.980]   But if you would, you can order it or you can.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.260]   So it's a little bit of a speaker.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:22.380]   It is.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.140]   Do you have a phone call?
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.660]   You could.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.740]   You can actually have a small phone call on it.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.980]   I don't. I think it's only got 20 minutes of talk.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.380]   Maybe that's the frames that only have 20 minutes of talk time.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.700]   I think the frames have 20 minutes of talk time.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.300]   I don't know what the ring has because who would talk to their ring?
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.860]   So those were the devices.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:48.060]   The other device that I was really stoked about was the new Echo Studio,
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:55.420]   which was a shaped like an ice bucket and it plays Dolby Atmos formatted stuff on
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.500]   a really high-end speaker.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.740]   It's kind of the competitor for Google's Max.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.820]   God, what is it?
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:02.300]   The Google.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:02.700]   Max.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.660]   Oh, Max.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:05.100]   Oh, Max.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:09.740]   So this one's $200, so $199.99.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:13.420]   And I kind of want it because, dang, it sounded really good.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:16.380]   And if you have a fire TV, it could almost replace a sound bar.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.940]   I mean, this was really well engineered from an audio standpoint.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.100]   So those are the devices.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.420]   So Stacey, you left out the two things I'm most curious about, given your opinions.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.940]   Okay.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.180]   One.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:38.060]   Is your dog going to be, have her privacy violated, wearing the Amazon dog collar thing?
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.540]   I can't wait to talk about sidewalk.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.060]   Okay.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:47.100]   Because y'all, it is a new wireless protocol.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.420]   And everyone who knows me knows that, like, I literally squealed in excitement.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.860]   It's doggy mesh, right?
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.620]   It's not a doggy mesh.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.340]   We'll talk about that.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:55.660]   Oh.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.420]   Okay.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.700]   The exciting thing here is what Amazon has done is create an infrastructure,
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.980]   or the potential for infrastructure that would allow it to set up its own wireless network,
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:14.620]   low data rate, low power, wireless network, wherever it sells devices.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:19.500]   And that is freaking amazing and a huge coup, because it would take out,
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.300]   it would compete with businesses like Sigfox,
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:27.500]   the cellular carriers with MBIOT, and things like Laura.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:33.820]   So what they did is they found out doing their ring security stuff.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.980]   They were like, oh, Wi-Fi really sucks outside of the house and in the neighborhood area.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.700]   So we need a good protocol that lets these lights and security things talk to each other.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:47.180]   And they realized that they didn't want to probably deal with cellular carriers,
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.220]   because who wants to do that?
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:48.780]   Of course.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.380]   So they took a 900 megahertz radio.
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:56.780]   They built a wireless protocol that is secure, or that they say secure on top of it.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.940]   So it allows these devices to talk to each other.
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.060]   It's a mesh network.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.980]   It is low power.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:05.260]   And because it's 900 megahertz, that's unlicensed spectrum,
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.980]   which means they're putting this in some of their ring devices.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.660]   They have 700 test devices in the LA basin amongst their--
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.780]   It's not like that.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:16.860]   It's all-- oh, I see.
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.820]   The way the press release read it, like there were 700 dogs.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:25.980]   No, 700 rings devices that have this radio in it.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.380]   And they have created a network that covers that.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.660]   To show that off, they launched something called Fetch, which is a dog color tracker thing.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.100]   So when your dog goes out of your yard, it'll notify you.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:41.580]   But it also will be able to track it anywhere within these other--
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:45.500]   anywhere within that coverage area.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:51.820]   So imagine now anything you buy from ring coming about in this, not the case today.
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.300]   The new stuff from ring will have this radio in it.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.900]   But eventually, anything you buy from Amazon, if they like this idea,
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.260]   could have this radio in it.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.740]   And then suddenly Amazon has this whole network infrastructure, wherever they have devices.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:08.300]   See, I don't think I understand this, because, well, maybe you just answered it,
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.820]   wherever these devices are.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:15.180]   What if you're in a rural area and you don't have another neighbor for another--
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:15.740]   Your dog's lost.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.140]   Five miles.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:16.700]   Five miles.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.260]   Yeah, your dog in that case is going to be lost.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:25.740]   It has about a half-- it's 500 meters is about the coverage for one radio.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:30.540]   So this is not going to work well in super rural areas.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:34.220]   Well, your dog runs two miles away, where they happen to have a bunch of them.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.340]   It'll pick back up again.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:35.660]   Right.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.140]   Okay.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:36.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.420]   So if you're in an area where people have these devices, then you've got a de facto network
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.060]   and de facto--
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.780]   It was going to take a while before it populates sufficiently.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.340]   All right.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:45.580]   So--
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:45.980]   I don't know.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.620]   Think about how fast they've been selling Amazon Echoes.
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.100]   That's true.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.420]   All right, Stacey, you're with the question.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:51.820]   Yes.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:52.540]   Wait, hold on.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:56.380]   In next year, they said they're going to release the SDK for the protocol,
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:59.180]   which means other people could put this in their devices.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.260]   And 900 megahertz is really popular for things like microwave ovens,
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.140]   for baby monitors, for garage doors.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.020]   It's crazy.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:07.260]   Okay.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.060]   But that doesn't mean--
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:08.540]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.500]   Now I've got two questions.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.860]   That doesn't mean--
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.900]   But the Amazon one is hooked up to an Amazon network that says,
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.260]   "Here's Fido."
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.460]   Well--
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.860]   Whereas I've used the SDK for something else.
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.980]   It's not hooked in the same network.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.340]   So yes.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:26.380]   We're talking about what is essentially two networks.
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.860]   One is a 900 megahertz network,
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.220]   which is all these devices communicating and your fetch device will talk to that.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.980]   All of those devices have to have a backhaul to the public internet.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:36.540]   Right.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.220]   Which in Amazon's case, the ring devices, it goes through Wi-Fi.
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:47.020]   So your dog's tracking is actually on a 900 megahertz thing in that signal.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:47.020]   Yes.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.220]   And two-souples Wi-Fi.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:49.100]   Yes.
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.740]   Any privacy implications to this?
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.820]   Well, that's--
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.540]   We don't know because we don't have the protocol.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.260]   There have been precedent.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.900]   So something like phone from back in--
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:02.940]   God, when was phone?
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.980]   F-O-N. That was probably 10 years ago.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:10.380]   They wanted to share people's public Wi-Fi by creating a separate Wi-Fi network.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.420]   Your cable company actually does this already.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:18.860]   Like Comcast has a public network that piggybacks on your Wi-Fi.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   So you've got your Wi-Fi that's personal,
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.420]   but then they also use your router to have other public Wi-Fi.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.180]   So--
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:31.180]   Could you--
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:31.820]   And you're still in this?
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.940]   No, I think it might still--
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.660]   Yeah, it does.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.700]   I think it still exists.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:37.500]   Phone.com.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.340]   So I mean, so from a--
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:46.380]   Like, I'm sure there are ways to hack into this.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.700]   I'm sure Amazon has considered a lot of them.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.100]   I'm sure that it will continuously update it,
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.380]   just like anybody who owns a protocol should update these things.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.060]   So the answer to your question is yes, probably,
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.900]   but I know they're thinking about that.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.900]   I should also mention that at the event,
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:05.500]   Amazon did spend the first 10 minutes talking about privacy
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.740]   and ways that they're protecting the privacy.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.060]   All right, Stacy, you still haven't answered my question.
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:10.540]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.820]   What was the other question?
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.580]   Will your little doggy be wearing one of these?
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.900]   No, because right now I don't live in an area where I have network coverage.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:18.380]   But--
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.020]   Well, if you have network coverage, yes.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:21.980]   Yes, yes.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.700]   OK.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.020]   Yes.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:23.260]   All right.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.580]   Here's my other device you haven't talked about.
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.420]   Ms. $1,500 June oven.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.300]   Are you getting the Amazon oven?
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.660]   He still--
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.260]   How could you not have led with that?
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:35.820]   Here we go.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:35.980]   Here we go.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:36.540]   You're Stacy, you can get both of them.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.500]   We talked about that on the show this morning.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.860]   So tomorrow's show's going to be very boring if you listen to my show,
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:43.900]   because we've been here a lot.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:49.180]   So big theme here.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.020]   Last year, Amazon's big theme was like,
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:53.260]   keep it simple, stupid,
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:55.980]   and help people get their devices on the network,
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.020]   and help make Madam A accessible all over the place.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:29:59.260]   Right?
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.740]   And this year they were like,
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.900]   hell yeah, we've done that and more.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:07.500]   And they had some really good talking points to prove that.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.660]   The next year, what they've signaled that they're focusing on,
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:17.740]   is making Madam A into a super platform that runs across all kinds of services and devices.
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:23.820]   And the oven is a great example of the power of that platform.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:27.660]   June, their oven is like, is it $7.99 right now?
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.820]   Because I know they had to raise prices because of tariffs.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.220]   So it's $7.99.
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.140]   You're paying for a camera.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:37.580]   You're paying for an NVIDIA Tesla chip that's doing the image recognition in there.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:41.020]   What Amazon has done is they've said, you know what?
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:45.820]   We don't need any of that because we have this digital assistant that it has.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:48.220]   So when you say, make me a baked potato,
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:52.700]   the June has to recognize that I've put a baked potato in there.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.620]   Amazon's oven, I'll just tell it that I'm putting a baked potato in there and then it cooks it.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.820]   And that's a very fundamental difference, but it makes a cheaper device
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.700]   and it shows the power of this type of Madam A platform.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.540]   And that is what I think about it.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.700]   Is there a separate Madam A device from the actual oven or is it built into the oven?
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.420]   Look like in the system.
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.180]   You need a dot.
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:15.980]   So the oven comes with a dot because it doesn't have Madam A inside of the oven,
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.620]   which is fine.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:21.980]   That's another example of the power of being able to do something like this.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:28.620]   You can just basically, you don't actually have to have the speaker or anything in there.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.900]   Right.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.980]   You could get one.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.100]   Stacey, are you getting one?
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.020]   I don't know.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.500]   I don't have the counter space, but I really want to try it.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.540]   So I'm probably going to try to get a review unit so I can send it back.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.340]   I believe Mr.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.340]   Someone else want to send me one to review.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:49.980]   You decided that wasn't Mr. Tofel excited about this about this last week when we talked about it.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.620]   I don't know why he was on it.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.500]   I wasn't on the show.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.260]   But he was.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:02.940]   He was the whole with the camera inside of it, recognizing a chicken breast or something like that.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:07.020]   And that's what's so cool about the June, but now you don't need that
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.780]   because the smarts are built into the digital assistant platform.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:14.220]   It doesn't matter if your oven recognizes the food because you just told it,
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.340]   what it's supposed to make.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.660]   I mean, it's a subtle difference, but it's a really important one.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.420]   If we think about the smart home going forward, because then you don't,
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:28.060]   you could build an internet connection into a device and have it talk to its preferred digital
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.780]   assistant.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.620]   So my lamp could have an internet connection, but it doesn't need to have a microphone and speaker.
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:36.460]   It's just controlled via my voice from the cloud.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:40.300]   So you could either have that oven or you could have a gemi twerking bear
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:45.580]   and they would operate roughly the same except one cooks things and one twerks.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.580]   One does nothing useful.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:52.460]   I am so down on this bear.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.340]   I hate this bear.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.740]   There was so much cool stuff and everyone's like the bear.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:58.460]   But it's a bear that's twerking.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.380]   It's cute, right?
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:03.820]   Sorry, you guys, there was a whole new wireless protocol.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:13.740]   Well, all I know is we don't have priorities, people, a hands-on review of the wireless protocol,
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:18.780]   but we do have a hands-on review of the twerking bear, which is with TV slash HOT.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.900]   Episode 54, look for that, Mike Asargent.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:25.900]   It's a great reviewed gemi.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.860]   It's gemi, right?
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.100]   Okay, gemi twerking bear.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.980]   Yes, it is a wonderful review.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.620]   Whether you like it or not, you should watch it, Stacy.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.020]   Just say.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.940]   Oh, and everyone, okay, I have to address this because it's happening in the chat room and I
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:43.500]   love you guys. But the issue isn't the ability to control your oven with your voice.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:49.900]   It's that you can be an idiot and not know how to cook food and it will do it at the right.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.140]   It's got the pre-programmed recipes and ability to control the cooking settings.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:59.260]   Well, see, that was my argument last week with it seems like for me,
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:05.020]   cooking is unless you're baking a cake or something, cooking is done a lot off of fuel.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:10.860]   You go to make a steak or what have you, you're seasoning it up and you're
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.220]   grilling it or whatever. It's a feel when you know when that thing is done.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.140]   It's eliminated anymore.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:18.700]   You're over.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.100]   If you don't have that knowledge.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.540]   It's going to happen without you now.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.380]   Oh, don't take that joy from me.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:28.540]   If you don't have that knowledge, this is a way to gain it without ruining.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.020]   Totally.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:34.380]   Like, you know, if you buy like a $50, what are those things called?
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.540]   I don't need a lot of meat. It's filet mignon, but big.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:37.020]   All right.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:37.580]   Ribas.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.860]   No.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.540]   It's that big hunk of meat.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.020]   Tenderloin.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:41.500]   Tenderloin.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.140]   Tenderloin.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:44.620]   Super expensive, right?
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:47.660]   And if you're cooking that thing, you were like, "Oh, my God."
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.300]   And I won't put that in my June oven.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.980]   And I don't even worry about it because it knows exactly.
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:57.900]   Like, it's like, and it's got like nine cooking cycles for these things, right?
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:01.500]   And that level of pre-programmed knowledge is the value here.
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.820]   It's not that I'm telling it to do something.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.700]   Order probes.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.620]   It's probes available with this.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:09.580]   I don't know if the Amazon oven has a program.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:09.980]   Oh, it's got no something.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:11.180]   I have to think it has to.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:11.500]   It has to.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:12.060]   It has feedback.
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:16.300]   Because it also has a feel when it comes with meat, you know,
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.340]   because one roast is going to cook a little bit faster than the other.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:24.540]   If it has a bone in it versus how much fat content it may have in it, it's feel.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:27.740]   And here's my confession here.
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:33.740]   So I was a ponderosa steakhouse kitchen manager.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.140]   I never made it up to the grill because I never got that.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:38.940]   You feel it.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:39.820]   You know it's meaty.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.380]   That's right.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.220]   It's this part of your head.
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:42.940]   Yes, exactly.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:43.980]   I could never get it.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.940]   I could never get it.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.220]   Meaty-raaar.
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.180]   That's not right.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:47.900]   Oh, my God.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.940]   What are you doing?
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.620]   This is for TV.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.860]   What I'm doing right now is just for TV.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.460]   It's not don't follow.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:55.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.740]   This part.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.340]   It does have a temperature.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.420]   It does.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.580]   That's because I don't feel scot a bone to me.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.020]   So does it have a dialogue?
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.180]   Is this like cook the meat?
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.220]   Does it say what meat?
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.740]   Yes, you say.
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.380]   How many potatoes?
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.420]   Cook salmon.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:12.780]   Is there any dialogue here?
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.380]   So it has a little more data from you.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:15.660]   So you can't.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.380]   I don't know.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.780]   My June, if I put a piece of salmon in it,
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:21.100]   it's asked me if I want it flaky or tender or something.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.260]   Also has a camera to know how big this salmon is.
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:23.740]   It's got to know.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:29.740]   Yes, but it's using the temperature probe.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.820]   I thought it was using scale and things like that,
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.500]   but it's really only using the probe.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.060]   OK.
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:34.860]   So the camera.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:39.180]   That makes it so I hate seeing an idiot proof.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.380]   You know, I get that.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.340]   And that's good though.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.100]   I mean, I know that there is a whole bunch of.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:43.820]   What was doing is Jeff proof.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:47.900]   If you like to cook, you like to cook,
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.900]   but there are tons of people who it's just.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:53.260]   Oh, my wife went on bed rest.
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:54.700]   And their search is how to boil water.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.340]   On one of their cooking sites.
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.300]   I'm terrible.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:00.780]   Well, my wife went on bed rest when she was pregnant with her
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.820]   with her first and second.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.140]   And I'm practically killed her with near raw chicken.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.260]   I have no idea what I'm doing.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.540]   No idea.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:07.980]   Oh, bless you.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.140]   I need the Jeff proof oven.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:13.500]   So maybe Jeff, you should be the guy reviewing this.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.500]   Tell your wife you're going to take a dinner and play with it.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:18.140]   See what happens.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.860]   I mean, something like this,
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:24.940]   like it doesn't have to replace the person who really enjoys cooking and can do it.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.660]   Right.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.940]   It's just another option.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.380]   Yeah, I did it.
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.780]   If you enjoy cooking, I enjoy cooking.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.420]   If you enjoy cooking, like continue to do that.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:33.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.500]   And people who have cooking Luddite,
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.900]   he's going to be slamming ovens to the ground.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:44.780]   You will not replace me while I'm out trying to find a hickory tree.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:50.540]   I was like, I like to cook, but it's so awesome.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.980]   Like I'll just pop like some chicken breasts into the June oven,
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.100]   stick that thing in there.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:58.060]   And I mean, and it's done.
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:37:59.020]   And I don't have to think.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:04.060]   I'll actually be cooking like our dinner while I do that for like to chop up on salads or whatever.
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.220]   So I mean, I don't know.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:08.380]   My daughter can cook and she's 13.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.060]   Sometimes you feel like cooking.
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:10.860]   Sometimes she don't.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.020]   It depends on the night.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.580]   If it's Thursday night football, no, I don't want to cook.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:21.340]   Throw it in your automated oven and be happy that it's cooking for you.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.740]   I want for lay now before kickoff.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.540]   Thank you.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.580]   There we go.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.380]   Sounds good to me.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:29.020]   Let's see here.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:33.340]   Before we get it, should we do the change log now or are we missing anything before the change log?
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.220]   Oh, hold on here.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:34.620]   Hold on.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:34.860]   I know.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.220]   There's so many things in here.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.980]   There's no way we're getting to it all.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.780]   No, not at all.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.300]   Hold on.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.020]   Hold on.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:43.660]   Is that really nice?
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:44.540]   It's all here.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.540]   I think you did a good job, fella.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:49.420]   I think you hit the interesting stuff.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:50.300]   Oh, I know one thing.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:50.700]   Yes.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:50.940]   Yes.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:59.020]   So Kamala Harris sends at Jack a letter urging him to suspend Trump's account.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:38:59.980]   What do we think of this?
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.340]   No, no.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:02.620]   Let's not talk about this at all.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.900]   How's it getting ready?
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:06.380]   Antic.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:06.780]   Antic.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.220]   That took a breath.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:11.260]   What?
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:11.580]   I don't know.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.700]   What do you think about it, Jeff?
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:14.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.820]   Well, I'm of two minds.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.020]   I'm arguing with myself.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:20.700]   The Stacy Me says and the Jeff Me says,
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:29.500]   I think normally I'm Mr. Free Speech, but this is not a matter of Free Speech,
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.780]   not a matter of First Amendment.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.820]   It's a private company.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:36.700]   And I think at some point the private companies have to say enough.
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.980]   The Twitter came up with a policy that's not following.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.340]   There were three policies announced in short order.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:48.860]   Twitter is for newsmakers, for important people, right, for politicians.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:51.260]   Twitter's policy was, we're going to leave it up,
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.660]   but we're going to put a sign on it that says,
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.220]   this violates our policy, but because it's a newsmaker,
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.260]   we're leaving it up so you can see.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:01.900]   Facebook and Facebook called me among 50 people,
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.860]   and I don't work for Facebook.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:04.380]   I did raise money for my school from Facebook,
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.220]   but I don't work for Facebook, but they call people.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:06.860]   They call this.
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:07.740]   What do you think we should do?
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:10.460]   And I said they should do a Twitter, as policy says,
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.820]   which is leave it up so we can see what the Dastardly deed is,
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.980]   but say it's a Dastardly deed, and this doesn't meet your standards.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:17.420]   They're not doing that.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.300]   I think it's a bad idea.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:21.340]   YouTube is following the Facebook model.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:23.020]   They're not going to do anything.
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:23.900]   They're just going to leave it up.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.780]   So I think that the Twitter model is the right model.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:28.300]   The problem is Twitter's not following it.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.540]   And but I kind of get that.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.980]   If you're Jack Dorsey sitting there,
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.220]   and are you going to be the brave person alone who's going to say,
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.500]   I'm going to start slapping around Trump in my own car.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, what a headache.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.340]   Give me some warm chocolate cake.
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.340]   Right.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:51.020]   And so I think that the Kamala Harris long-winded answer,
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:52.780]   you're sorry, you asked me, but I asked myself in a way.
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.740]   The Kamala Harris letter gives him cover to do something.
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.460]   And I think that we have to start doing that.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.740]   I think we have to start putting not just pressure on the platforms,
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:10.060]   but also cover for saying it's not good enough to go Lazy Fair and leave it all up.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.580]   You've got to take a stand at some point.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:15.340]   If you start people start calling for civil war,
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:19.100]   that's going over the edge here, folks.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.420]   And you can't just let this happen without comment from you.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:25.980]   And so maybe Twitter comes and says, no, we're not going to take it down,
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.980]   but we are going to start putting the warning up.
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.100]   And maybe that's a good thing.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.340]   And maybe it starts to have a better discussion about what kind of internet
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.020]   discussion we want to have since you asked, since I asked.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:35.820]   That's my answer.
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.980]   You guys, I'm with you.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:43.500]   The only issue I had with it is the, what do you call it?
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.100]   Letterhead.
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.540]   Why don't I blank out on that word?
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.780]   It comes off as it's campaigning when I see the letterhead.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.460]   Take that out and I'm totally fine.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.900]   Which letterhead did she use her campaign letterhead?
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.460]   Well, if she had used her Senate letterhead,
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.420]   would that have seemed to be trying to intimidate
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.500]   Twitter by using official position?
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.180]   No, because she is who she is.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.780]   She is a Senator.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.900]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.940]   Isn't she there, Senator? Isn't she?
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.620]   She's California.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:16.060]   Yeah, so that's...
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.620]   It's not an intimidation.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.340]   That way you're right.
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:22.140]   That's just a fact, you know, but this looks more like,
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:24.220]   um, campaigning, in my opinion.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.140]   That's, that's what stopped me.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.020]   But I get to...
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:29.500]   Well, to my mind, so does Elizabeth Warren saying
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.340]   she wants to break up the platforms.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:31.980]   That's campaign.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.180]   That's campaign.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:37.660]   Yeah, when anyone's running for president or hoping to,
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:42.860]   you know, make it into contention to be the next president,
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:45.500]   I just kind of assume almost anything they're doing
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.860]   has that at least in mind.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:48.860]   You know, that everything is through that optic.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:56.060]   At the same time, where it feels like in very unprecedented times right now,
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.300]   and sometimes that calls for things that, you know,
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.780]   are outside of the norm.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.140]   And I feel like, so, so if Kamala Harris,
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.420]   Kamala Harris, sorry, is moved to do this right now,
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.860]   it's kind of a little of both, right?
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.220]   Like, of course it's campaigning,
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.180]   but it also might be out of a point of necessity
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.700]   for someone in her position to do that.
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:20.860]   So Stacey, you didn't want to answer the question.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.100]   You didn't want to talk about this,
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.300]   but I'm curious to hear your response.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:24.780]   No, I...
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.580]   You know, I think Jack had...
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:28.220]   Was it him?
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:30.860]   Someone had recently come out saying
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:34.300]   that politicians are held to a different standard on Twitter,
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.140]   newsmakers being held to a different standard.
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:38.380]   And I actually think that's right.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:38.780]   I think...
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:47.100]   I mean, part of me is utterly dismayed at the lowering of presidential discourse
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:50.140]   or lowering of just any civil discourse,
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.660]   and by civil, I don't mean being nice,
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.900]   but like civil around democracy and...
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.740]   Talking about our society.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:01.660]   And in that, I mean, the president's tweets, obviously,
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.220]   I mean, they just...
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.100]   They make me sad.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:09.180]   There is a lot of hate coming out,
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.300]   and it feels sanctioned,
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:12.460]   but I don't see how you can take someone
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.140]   like the president of the United States
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:15.900]   off of a platform like Twitter.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.620]   Do you think...
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   Do you think Twitter should label things
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.940]   that otherwise would not pass their standards?
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.740]   Yes, I think it...
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:28.220]   But that's always going to be politicized.
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:28.780]   They're always...
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.540]   He's right.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.740]   The right is always going to call that as a political step.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.980]   Until actually I understand why...
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:37.740]   I don't really know.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.460]   You can't build...
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.980]   I mean, the thought of it is,
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:41.180]   "Oh, let's build an algorithm."
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.740]   But we all know that algorithms are just as biased as we are.
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:44.540]   So...
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:51.340]   This is kind of arguing morality in some ways, right?
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:53.980]   Like, we all have different versions of it,
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:55.660]   and we know what's really wrong.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:56.220]   And I could...
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.660]   I feel that most people on Twitter can look at that and say,
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.820]   "This is not how we would like to have our president discuss things."
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.620]   But there is a small segment of people
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.140]   who are really thrilled by this,
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:13.820]   and it emboldens them when you try to stop it.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.780]   The bottom line is, it makes me sad,
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.540]   and I'm very confused.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:19.340]   I mean, it makes me sad,
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.940]   but I don't think it should be shut down.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.140]   I guess it's really funny.
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:22.780]   I don't like it.
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:25.660]   It's polarizing on both sides,
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.380]   just like you said.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:30.540]   So, yeah.
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.660]   It makes me sad too.
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:32.620]   Sorry.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:35.260]   I know this is Stacy's really insightful comment.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.220]   It makes me sad.
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:36.860]   This is not...
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.980]   Let's talk about wearing the protocols.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.660]   It's not whiskey.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.780]   We'll get you some whiskey under the show.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.620]   All right.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.580]   And...
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.420]   Why don't we then...
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.500]   Sound the horns.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.380]   Yes.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:54.540]   The Google changed log.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:57.740]   That was the end one at the beginning.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:58.300]   That's okay.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:01.100]   We'll do the horns at the end.
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.740]   When Leo's out of here, we do things opposite.
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:04.860]   It's opposite day today.
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:11.500]   So, I know that you don't care about dark mode, Jeff, but...
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.260]   It's not a question of not caring.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.860]   It's a question of hating it.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:15.260]   Okay.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:15.500]   I know that.
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.460]   It's a question of...
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:16.860]   Wow.
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.180]   ...of Niagara Falls.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.060]   Step by step.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:20.940]   Wow.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:21.980]   No kidding.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:24.140]   Jeff has no mild opinions.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:27.980]   It creeps me out.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:28.940]   Oh man.
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:30.700]   Go ahead, Jason.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.580]   Go ahead.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:32.620]   I'm going to lead with it.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.660]   Reap me out, fella.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:38.300]   Google messages and Google Voice both getting their dark mode theme.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.580]   They aren't listening to you, Jeff.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:43.660]   They're going forward with the dark mode.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.980]   Because they kind of promised that they would.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:46.140]   So...
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:47.660]   That's happening.
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.100]   Not a whole lot with them.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:51.580]   You don't add your dark mode on Gmail, by the way.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:56.380]   And it turns Gmail, but the actual emails when you open them are still like.
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.420]   So, it's absolutely...
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.540]   Oh, it's still buggy.
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:00.300]   That's a little broken.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.580]   Gmail knows best.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.020]   It's protected.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:03.340]   So...
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.140]   Gmail and Jeff are in care who it's.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.580]   ...comprehension of your email.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.660]   Otherwise, you wouldn't really be able to read it.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:11.180]   You'd be reading the slower you headache.
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:12.140]   Oh, it's protecting you.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:13.500]   ...female knows best.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.700]   It's saving you.
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:20.700]   Google announced a number of privacy and security related features rolling out soon.
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.380]   Just real quick here.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.980]   Maps is finally getting its incognito mode update, which we've heard about.
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:29.420]   You would just tap profile photo, turn on incognito mode,
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.500]   and then you're searching, you're navigating.
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.660]   All that stuff would be incognito.
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.140]   So it would not be saved to your Google account or guide any personalization in the app.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:39.660]   Annerys is going to get it this month.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.820]   iOS will be getting it soon.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.180]   Also, YouTube is getting auto delete history functionality.
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:50.780]   This happened a few months ago, I think back in May for deleting location of web activity.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.900]   Now, YouTube's getting it.
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:56.380]   You'll have the option of auto deleting your YouTube activity after three months,
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:59.340]   or 18 months, or you can choose to just delete it on your own,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.620]   or keep it forever, whatever.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.180]   It's up to you.
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:06.220]   Soon coming to Assistant, you can delete Assistant activities simply by saying,
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:10.060]   "Hey, G, delete everything I said last week," or something along those lines.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:12.220]   Yeah, I wish I could do that for life.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:12.780]   That's awesome.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.500]   Yeah, right.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.500]   Oh, I was like, "Amazon said you can do that now for Battle of A," by the way.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.940]   Oh, okay, that's awesome.
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.660]   So that is apparently going to hit Assistant Devices next week.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:28.300]   And then also, one other thing here, password checkup is coming to Chrome later this year.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.980]   It's going to check to see if a user's password has been leaked or compromised
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.580]   in known data breaches.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:40.780]   You'll be able to find that within Chrome, I think at the passwords.google.com site.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:46.700]   And Chrome will warn you to change your password when it finds that your ID and your password
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:52.460]   have been found in any of those databases for previously known data breaches.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:59.340]   Google Play will now have new settings for bulk adjustments.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.660]   So if you go to Settings, General, Google Play Preferences, and I don't know if this is there yet,
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:11.260]   but it's coming, you'll have the ability to in bulk clear wish lists, leave from all of the betas,
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:15.180]   you just want to be done with all betas, you could do that one swoop instead of having to
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.660]   remember and go in and do it individually.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:22.940]   Unregister for upcoming events and unregister for App and Game Preregistrations.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:26.060]   So that's a couple of options there.
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:33.900]   YouTube Music is now going to replace Google Play Music as the default music player on Android 10.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.500]   No one's thrilled about that one.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:36.940]   I'm not thrilled about that one.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:42.540]   And this would only be for like a new device or a factory reset, that sort of thing.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:43.420]   If you--
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:45.100]   But Play Music still exists.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.620]   Play Music still exists, yes.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:47.020]   Oh, OK.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.500]   It's not going anywhere yet.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:53.260]   Google has said that it won't go anywhere until something along the lines of YouTube
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:58.060]   music has feature parity for the most part, all the main features, and we are nowhere near that.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:03.500]   Yet Google is still kind of on this trajectory of making YouTube music replace it.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.860]   I feel like it's a little premature because I'm just not a big fan, but
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.380]   there you go.
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:10.060]   Google has its reasons.
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:17.260]   Google Duo for Android is getting an update that now includes effects and filters for video
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:17.900]   messages.
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:24.940]   So you can have things like animated backgrounds, things like glasses to wear to that track along
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:25.580]   with your face.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:29.740]   At this point, this feels like old news, but Duo is getting it now.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:35.420]   It's some more traditional color filters, that sort of stuff coming to Duo for messages.
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:36.940]   This is actually really neat.
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.260]   Action Blocks, which was just announced today.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:44.860]   It's a new accessibility tool for creating multi-step tasks using Assistant.
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:48.540]   It's actually designed for people with cognitive disabilities.
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:52.220]   You can do something like add a title, assign an Assistant Task.
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:54.540]   So spell out what the Assistant Task will do.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:59.340]   You can pick an image to be associated with it, and then that's placed as a shortcut on your home screen.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:03.740]   So that when someone is using their device and they look at the home screen and they see the picture,
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:09.100]   the example that they have is of a man reading a story to a little girl,
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:14.460]   then that would fire off an Assistant command to read a story.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:16.380]   And it would jump into it.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:19.980]   It would be an easier way for them to just put one with one tap.
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:23.100]   It's a great scene of effort like this being put in there.
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:27.500]   We were just looking in the Twit community, the Twit backstage, Twit.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:28.780]   Community, Twit.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:29.660]   Twit.com community.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:35.500]   There. Someone was just bringing that up saying, "Hey, we need more recognition and
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:41.020]   acknowledgement for people with disabilities and accessibility concerns when it comes to using
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:45.580]   today's technology other than voice activation."
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:48.620]   There's a lot going on in Android when it comes to accessibility right now.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:51.020]   I feel like Android for the longest time was behind.
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:52.780]   And now especially the live captions.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:56.140]   That's such a huge, huge step forward.
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.020]   So yeah, the competition's a wonderful thing.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:51:59.980]   Absolutely.
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:02.860]   And that's just amazing that that's coming out now.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:07.740]   And then finally, yet another service to add to Google's list of killed services.
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:15.260]   Bulletin, if you remember, was a hyper local news service similar in ways to next door.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:17.900]   It launched in 2018.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:21.340]   And it's shuttering in two weeks time.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:23.260]   Shared posts if you shared it hardly there.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.300]   Yeah, really.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.740]   In fact, we forgot you.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.340]   We completely forgot you.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:27.980]   Yes.
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.940]   It wasn't really available.
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.460]   It was only available in a few places.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.340]   We didn't promote it.
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:33.820]   No way you knew it would put anything up there.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:38.460]   And it's the same problem with, in my biz of user generated news, is like, "Why should I?
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.420]   What am I getting out of this?"
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:40.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:43.500]   So quite honestly, this is the first time I've heard of Google Bulletin.
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:43.660]   Right.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.660]   Well, I vaguely-
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:46.460]   See what you missed.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.300]   Yeah, I vaguely remember hearing about it.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.700]   And then it was just kind of gone and forgotten.
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:54.780]   And obviously so, because a year later, it's being shuttered.
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:59.180]   So if you happen to share anything on there, you have until November 22nd to pull it off.
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.260]   And then it's gone forever.
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.140]   And that is the Google change log.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.860]   In reverse.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.460]   Nicely done.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:08.940]   Sorry.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.660]   Nicely done.
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:10.940]   Well done.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:11.420]   All right.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.420]   Cool.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:17.260]   We make the show our own when Leo is traveling the world.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.860]   He's going to stop leaving you in charge.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.220]   We actually talked about Google.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.900]   We did that first.
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.900]   [laughter]
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:28.620]   Although Jeff and I still have a short flight.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:32.140]   So I'm like Team Helvetica versus Team,
[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:34.300]   I don't know which Sarah you were going to go for.
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.100]   I'm assuming it's time's new Roman.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.620]   Kazlan.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:38.940]   Okay.
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:40.620]   Well, actually, there's a story about Kazlan.
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:41.100]   Oh.
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:41.100]   Oh.
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:41.580]   Oh.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:41.580]   Oh.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:41.580]   Oh.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:41.580]   Oh.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.140]   Oh.
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:42.460]   I started-
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.740]   Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:44.780]   [laughter]
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.820]   When Uncle Jeff starts-
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:46.460]   Here we go.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.580]   Oh, goody.
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:49.260]   Hit story time.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.940]   So when I started, entered him a weekly.
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:55.820]   The design was frankly, I will admit it today, ugly at first.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:59.260]   And there were other business reasons why we were getting cancellations,
[01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:00.940]   because- but it wasn't my fault.
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.380]   But they were blaming the design,
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.340]   because it was the first major magazine produced all Macintosh.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:07.020]   Entirely Macintosh entirely quirk.
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:08.940]   And they came and they said,
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:10.060]   "It's that font.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.340]   It's that unreadable font.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:12.860]   You picked this computer font.
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.380]   It's a postmodern font."
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.940]   It was Kazlan.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.020]   Kazlan has been around for centuries.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.780]   And indeed, in the lobby of Time Inc,
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:27.740]   they had a huge typographic sculpture of a whole font tray.
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:29.420]   It was like a story tall.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.220]   It was Kazlan.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.420]   It was exact same font,
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:35.500]   but it was that postmodern computer font you use, Jarvis.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:39.180]   So I have a certain soft spot in my heart.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.020]   I'm not bored.
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:45.100]   It was the font used for the US Declaration of Independence.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:45.660]   Haslan.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.580]   Wow.
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:48.860]   Kazlan.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:50.380]   All right.
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.820]   With reverence.
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:55.660]   I saw something like a month ago.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:57.260]   It's probably a meme of some sort.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:01.900]   It was like it was making fun of the fact that avatar with all the
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.380]   millions upon millions of dollars,
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:08.780]   budget and everything still opted for papyrus as its
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.060]   font set for its logo.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:15.500]   It's like, yep, they just decided we could do anything with all of our money,
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:19.900]   but papyrus is the right font to choose for the logo of this multi-million dollar movie.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.820]   That's my font story.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.580]   That's the only font story I have right now.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:23.980]   Sorry.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.500]   I had to contribute.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:29.500]   Let's do numbers and tips and tricks.
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.460]   I already did my tool.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:36.220]   So if you don't remember, it's the recorder app and find it on APK Mirror.
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:37.900]   Jeff, what is your number?
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:41.100]   What other number could it be today?
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.420]   Has to be on this show of all shows.
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:45.100]   Google can drink.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:47.820]   Google is 21 years old.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:47.820]   What year is it?
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:47.820]   Oh.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.380]   Who's going to take Google out and get Google drunk?
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.820]   Well, I think Google should take us all out and get a test.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:55.820]   Sure.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.260]   I'm going to put it on there, Don.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:59.020]   That Google can foot the bill.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:01.100]   I'll go.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.380]   Just put it on there, Don.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.620]   Google could afford to buy the world a drink.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.020]   Really?
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:07.260]   Happy birthday, Google.
[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.620]   Happy birthday, Google.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:09.660]   No, not.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:12.060]   I told you what happened to you.
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:14.780]   I told you what happened to you.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.540]   All I want to do is come to the party.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:17.740]   Come on, Jason.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:19.180]   Obviously, Google is listening.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:20.300]   It's like, I'm here for the drink.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:23.660]   Did you say drinks?
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:25.020]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:26.300]   I think we should have a little song.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:28.940]   We should, I think we should all sing it.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.500]   Ready?
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:30.300]   I wanted to sing.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.620]   One, two, three.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:36.140]   Happy birthday, dear Google.
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:40.700]   Happy birthday, dear Google.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:41.660]   Happy birthday.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:47.900]   Happy birthday, dear Google.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:55.900]   Happy birthday, dear Google.
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.460]   Okay.
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:59.260]   That was really, really awful.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:02.300]   We will not be winning any Oscars or Emmys or anything.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.500]   Look what you've done, Jeff.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.540]   Look what you've done.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.540]   Did the viewership just drop off?
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:11.260]   Pretty sure.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:13.340]   Yeah, I think the chat room is acting down.
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:15.100]   That was, it's ran out of the room.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:21.020]   If Leo wasn't convinced before, never to leave again.
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:21.660]   Yep.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:22.860]   Now he definitely does.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.460]   I have a cool tool.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:25.340]   All right, what's your tool?
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:28.940]   Okay, this is super nerdy, but I love it.
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.660]   And it's been around for a while and I had no idea.
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:33.020]   It's called PlantNet.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:35.580]   And it's this community project to identify.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.980]   You take a picture of your plant, any plant on the phone.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:41.740]   And it identifies it for you.
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:43.180]   Oh, that is cool.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:43.820]   That is cool.
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:45.260]   And it's free.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.860]   And when you log in, you don't have to log in.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:53.100]   So you could do all this and be totally selfish and not contribute back to the community.
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:55.900]   But it'll identify plants even if you don't log in.
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:59.260]   I've done that with Google Assistant.
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:00.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:05.020]   So this is a little bit, it's better than Google Assistant.
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:06.220]   Oh, yeah, it says you.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.660]   I've tried to identify plants with Google Assistant.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:15.260]   But yeah, so it's using image recognition.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:20.940]   It takes your images and you can add your location and you say, hey, this is it.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:26.300]   Anyway, so far I have tried all kinds of crazy plants and it works really well.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:28.060]   I love it.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:33.500]   As a person who's kind of nerdy and stupid, I'm really excited about this.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.500]   So that's my week of the week.
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:39.340]   Let's see here.
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:42.220]   So what's a plant I can do a search for here?
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:47.100]   Oh, do the chocolate vine because I have one near my house and it's growing.
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.700]   Chocolate vine.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.660]   Chocolate vine.
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:53.740]   Okay, let's see if I can get this to work here.
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:56.860]   Hold on.
[01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:59.580]   I'm just trying to get the image and a new tab.
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.900]   See if this will work.
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:02.700]   It might not work.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:04.060]   I don't know if you've got the overhead.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:04.700]   Oh, nice.
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:05.980]   I see what you're doing here.
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.020]   Certainly try this.
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:08.620]   I see your job.
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:10.220]   Okay, so there's chocolate vine.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.220]   There's the app.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:14.860]   I'll go camera.
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:16.380]   Yes, allow.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.060]   Allow.
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:20.540]   You and all your security.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.340]   Okay, so then I take the shot.
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.940]   It might not be framed perfectly for the...
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.700]   Let's see.
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:29.020]   I'll be surprised that this works.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.620]   It's all pixelated and everything.
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.180]   Choose related organ.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:34.780]   So that's a flower.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:35.420]   Take a flower.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:39.260]   Like what part of the tree or what part of the plant are you looking at?
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.220]   That sounded very bad.
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:43.740]   Chocolate vine.
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:44.540]   We got it.
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:45.420]   Got it.
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:46.380]   Outstanding.
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:47.420]   Boom.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:49.580]   That vine is chocolate.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:53.980]   I have one of those and they make these weird crazy looking fruits.
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:56.220]   And I was like, what the heck are these giant
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:58.300]   weird fruit things?
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.860]   And now I know.
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.260]   Nice.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.180]   That is really cool.
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:03.660]   I know you guys.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.140]   That is really cool.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:05.180]   I'm super nerdy about this.
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:07.980]   I love it and I'm happy that it worked.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:10.460]   It's always nice when a demonstration works.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:13.020]   Yeah, especially that particular demonstrate.
[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:13.900]   I was like, wow.
[02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:14.860]   It could, yeah.
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:16.060]   Who knows?
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:19.500]   Who knows where to pick up the level of difficulty there and it worked.
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.220]   But it worked.
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.380]   That's what I like.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:22.700]   All right.
[02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:23.340]   Ant what you got.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.820]   Mine is a little bit different.
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:31.100]   As I said previously in the show, I like airplanes.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.140]   I'm an AV nerd and just love watching airplanes.
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:40.700]   And there's a website I go to that's called airlinepilotguy.com.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:43.500]   But they also happen to do a podcast.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:48.140]   Now, when you go and look up news from airlines and so forth,
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.900]   nine times out of 10, it's sad.
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:56.860]   These guys, they give you what they say, a view from the pilot's perspective.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:00.380]   Yes, they share news that is some sad news, but there's also some other things
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.220]   out there that's really nerdy and technical.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:07.740]   And they are actually big fans of the Twit Network too, I found out.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:09.900]   Oh, you know, the main guy.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:10.620]   The main guy.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:12.860]   I'm Captain Jeff.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:14.780]   He's the main airline pilot.
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:16.540]   He taught me himself.
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:21.580]   He was inspired by our Mr. Leo Laport to start his podcast and start to work.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:21.980]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:24.700]   Even down to using these particular microphones.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.380]   And very nice.
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:30.860]   But I love the podcast, like I said, because it's real nerdy.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:31.820]   What kind of things do you learn?
[02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:32.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:38.380]   And it's not always just the bad news because Boeing is screwing up and having all of their
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:41.100]   issues with the 737 MAX and so forth.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:42.060]   But there's other things out there.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.100]   There's a new thing today.
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:43.580]   Good story.
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:44.060]   Did you see it today?
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.020]   Oh, no.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.220]   I didn't see it today.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:46.700]   No.
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:48.300]   New 737 there.
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:54.780]   And within a week, they've got to inspect all kinds of 737s for fatigue and the wings.
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:55.500]   Oh, man.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.300]   See?
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:57.660]   Hmm.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:02.700]   I like getting more uplifting stuff on my podcast.
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:06.700]   I don't like all the sad news.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.900]   But these guys are funny.
[02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:12.940]   Now, I know we have long podcasts on here, but their shows are usually about three hours long.
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:13.580]   What is?
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:15.100]   Yeah, about three hours long.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:16.220]   What is funny?
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:18.380]   And I really do enjoy listening to those guys.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:19.740]   Captain Jeff.
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:20.620]   It makes us seem
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:23.900]   positively brief.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:24.140]   Yeah.
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:25.980]   I know.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.860]   I think we've had three hour shows on this network.
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:29.180]   Oh, really?
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:32.220]   It's happened for sure.
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:34.220]   And folks in the chat room are saying that some of them
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:35.820]   some of them actually do call in.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:39.740]   They've actually been relatively frequent guests on the tech guy.
[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:40.780]   That's awesome.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:41.580]   That's awesome.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:41.900]   Yeah.
[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.260]   But yeah, it's Captain Jeff.
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.700]   There's Captain Dana.
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:48.460]   There's also retired Captain Nick and Dr. Steph.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:56.060]   They're all just varying ranges of aviation certification and so forth.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.420]   So you get different point of view and a lot of different fun stories.
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:02.540]   And they have a good time with bourbon and beer.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:02.780]   Nice.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:04.220]   Not while flying.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:05.420]   Not while flying, though.
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:05.980]   Yes.
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:06.460]   Yes.
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:07.260]   Not while flying.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.260]   But that's what is all to be.
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:10.700]   Captain, so I like that.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:11.020]   Yeah.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:11.500]   Yes.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:12.300]   But that's my pick.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.420]   It's just something that's a little more happy and uplifting.
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:15.740]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:16.220]   Right on.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:16.940]   Nice.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:18.140]   Good pick.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.500]   Good pick, Captain Ant.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:21.980]   Thank you, Captain Howell.
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:22.780]   Thank you.
[02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:26.940]   We are all captains here, including you, Captain Stacy and Captain Jeff.
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:28.940]   And Captain listeners.
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:33.740]   We might be an insult to captains everywhere.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:34.140]   It's true.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:37.900]   I might be really insulting captains in our world.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:38.940]   And our whole pile of this Carston.
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:41.980]   Carston the first mate.
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:43.340]   Carston.
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.540]   Today it's actually John.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:45.020]   It's John.
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:45.900]   Oh, it is John.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:46.140]   Yes.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:46.940]   Carston.
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:47.980]   What do I have a gun to do?
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:49.260]   Insulted or attacked today?
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:54.220]   Carston is with the team getting ready for the last past.
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:54.780]   Oh, bust.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:55.420]   Oh, OK.
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:56.860]   That happens tomorrow.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:58.860]   But that's it.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:03:59.980]   We've reached the end.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.740]   Captain Jeff, what do you want to leave people with?
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:02.460]   Where should people--
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:03.980]   Or just plain old--
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:05.500]   Buzz machine.com?
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.380]   We could be up to medium.
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:07.340]   Yeah, it's fun.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.260]   Medium at Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.860]   Don't do a search for Captain Jeff.
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:11.820]   You probably won't find him.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.260]   You might find a Captain Jeff.
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:14.380]   You might find Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:20.060]   Also Captain Stacey Higginbotham, StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:22.060]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:23.580]   Always fun doing a show with you.
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:25.420]   At Gigas Stacey on Twitter.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.980]   And then Captain Ann Pruitt.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:30.780]   I am sitting at the table.
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.180]   Yes.
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:34.140]   Anything you want to promote or--
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:34.540]   Absolutely.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.460]   You do have a hands-on tech episode.
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:38.620]   I want to promote first and foremost,
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:40.220]   hands-on tech with--
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:43.740]   With what Micah did with that bear.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.460]   OK, Amy.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:45.660]   That was pretty--
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.180]   It was pretty dag, I'm funny.
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.620]   Pretty, pretty well done.
[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:50.940]   I also have my OpSpot Tail review out there
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.020]   where you get to meet my dog, Kylo Finn.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:55.580]   But actually go back and check out
[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:56.940]   Trangulation from last week.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.740]   Ah, yes.
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:02.940]   That is a twit.tv/tri episode 416,
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:05.340]   where I sat down with my friend, Todd Moore,
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:10.380]   who is the developer for the popular app, White Noise.
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:14.540]   Watch how that app just changed his life.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.300]   It was pretty fascinating.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.380]   Now, did you know him before the app?
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.420]   I knew him right as he was getting into it
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.700]   met him several years ago.
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:24.860]   Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:26.220]   I mean, that's a huge app.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.660]   It's a huge app.
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:30.540]   I mean, I use that app every time I travel.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:31.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:32.860]   When I travel, that's the app that I use.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:35.260]   It was a fun conversation.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:37.180]   I don't want to share too much here.
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:38.300]   Go over there and check it out.
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:39.420]   It's worth a listen.
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:42.140]   Right on, that's that TV/tri.
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:45.020]   Yes, episode 416 with Todd Moore.
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.460]   And that was your first Trangulation.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:47.260]   That was my first.
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:47.820]   Fantastic.
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:48.700]   And I survived.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:50.300]   You did, see?
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:51.900]   See?
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:52.540]   Need to.
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:53.260]   Need to do great.
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:55.100]   All right.
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:56.460]   And then, yeah, as for me,
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.460]   I'm just here doing shows on the Twit Network.
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:00.460]   Tomorrow, actually, Tech News Weekly.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:02.620]   Ant is going to be sitting with me.
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:02.940]   Wait, what?
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:04.060]   Like, is off?
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:05.100]   Do I not tell you?
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:05.660]   I'm doing it.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:06.300]   We'll talk about it.
[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.060]   Michael will not be here tomorrow.
[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:14.140]   So Ant will be on set with me.
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:14.620]   Oh, boy.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:15.420]   Oh, oh, oh.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:17.260]   Visiting hitter.
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:17.580]   Yes.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:21.980]   Yeah, apparently I didn't do a good job prepping for this show.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:23.900]   You're going to be great.
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:24.380]   We'll talk.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:26.860]   But that's Twit.tv/tnw.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:30.700]   If you want to go there, you can find all sorts of interviews
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:32.380]   and episodes last week.
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:35.100]   We had Stacey on to talk about the Amazon stuff.
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:36.780]   So, yeah, it's a fun show.
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.220]   Definitely check it out this week.
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:41.180]   And I will be talking to a few interesting people
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:42.460]   as we do each and every week.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:44.060]   That is it though.
[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:45.580]   For this episode of This Week in Google,

[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:12.940]   Is it community?
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:14.380]   Yes, Twit.
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:16.380]   Twit.community.

[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.580]   It's on Discord.
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:25.100]   It's just a really cool kind of community forum, essentially.
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:28.460]   And we're all contributing and pitching in.
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:31.500]   And there's a lot of active discussions happening right now.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.260]   It's been a lot of fun in the page.
[02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:34.460]   It's been a lot of fun in there.
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:38.300]   It's cool seeing people, you know, they have questions start threads.
[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:44.460]   I mean, it's a true forum based around everything that we do our shows here on.
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:47.900]   You know, you could talk directly to us.
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:49.260]   You could talk to each other.
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:53.660]   It's just another option for you to kind of keep communicating with other people,
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:56.780]   like-minded people who are interested in technology the way that you are.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:59.100]   So that is in this dark mode.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:00.460]   Twit.community.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:01.420]   Yeah, there is a dark mode.
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:02.700]   You can turn on dark mode.
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:03.740]   So there you go, Jack.
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:04.380]   Cool.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:05.340]   You just taught me.
[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:08.140]   But that is it.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:09.660]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:11.420]   Thank you, John, for your help.
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:13.740]   And thanks to Burke, who's helping out here too.
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:16.540]   Everyone who helps us do these shows each and every week.
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:17.900]   We can't do it without you guys.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.020]   So we really appreciate your help.
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:20.700]   And thanks to you for watching and listening.
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:23.820]   We'll see you next week on another episode of This Week in Google.
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:24.460]   Bye, everybody.
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.500]   Seriously.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:31.020]   Right at the end.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:32.940]   You got me, Captain.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.340]   Of course you did that.
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:38.220]   Dad, how are you in the show?
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:41.420]   Yeah, it should be every time.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.620]   Every time what you're doing.
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:50.060]   Yes.
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:09:13.060]   [ Silence ]
