[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.840]   Ooh-hoo!
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.240]   But hey, there's good news Matt Cutz fills in.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.040]   Jeff Jarvis, Matt Cutz, and I'll talk about the latest Google algorithms, including Penguin Panda.

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   This is Twig.

[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   This is Twig, this week in Google, episode 227, recorded December 4, 2013.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   Turn up drones.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   This week in Google is brought to you by Jira, an Atlassian product.

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers, Google, the cloud, the Googleverse, the Facebookverse,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   the Twitterverse, and anyverse that we should like to cover. We begin our sad months wandering in the wilderness without Gina Trapani.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Jeff Jarvis, how are we going to do it? It's just so difficult.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Gina!
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Somebody said she was in the run-down.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   It looked like it, but then she was gone.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   Maybe she misses us.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   I hope she's not taking a look at the show when she's not on it.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   That would be sad.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   You won't catch me in the run-down, even on the weeks I'm here.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   But we do have a very fitting replacement from Google itself, one of its earliest employees,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   and one of the most forthright and greatest guys ever from Google Mac cuts.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   He's in charge of Google spam fighting.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Also does this great Google Webmaster videos.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Hi, Matt. Nice to see you.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Good to see you, too.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   I like your Hello Kitty.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   How can you get a dinosaur?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Are you in your home, the conference room?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   I'm at home right now.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   So you must have small children, or else you have a weird fetish.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   Well, you know, you want to have a little bit of variety to break up.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Okay, I'm not going to press you on it.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   They now have $80 dinosaur head, so I was thinking about replacing Hello Kitty with a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Yeah, they've been doing ads for those giant wall stickers.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   Yeah, you can get, you know, football players, giant dinosaurs, whatever.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Would you have one of those inner columns, Matt?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Yeah, you?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   I do.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   Yeah, I've never used it.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Did you actually use it?
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   No, it's horrible.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   No, whatever uses it.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Yes, it needs to be a bit.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   Jeff, are you inhaling helium?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Oh, well, I almost did.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   I'm back from the dentist.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   But you sound like you sound like this.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   I do?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   I do.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Yes, would you lower your voice, please?
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Oh, no.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I think it's an artifact of whatever.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Are you using Skype?
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   No, I have volunteer to try to switch or what?
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   Try.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Let's switch you to Skype.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   Matt, is there any way to bring hang?
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   Is there a button in Hangouts that gives you a high pitched voice?
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   That would be a pretty...
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Okay, I'm going to file that as a...
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   I really like that idea.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   Helium voice.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   Helium voice.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   I'm all numbed up.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   I have two crowns.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   All right, that's enough of that.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Oh, God!
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Public parts.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   That's where's the jaws?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Shark Week on this week in Google.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   So, gosh, there's so many things to talk about.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   I'm so excited.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   I'll do that.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Yeah, I'll do that.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   We're going to call him back.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   Okay.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   So, I'm going to call him back.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   He's going to be a little bit more excited about him.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   He really does sound like that.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   And that's not, despite all appearances, his normal voice.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   So, how's things going, Matt?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   They're going pretty well.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   You know, I actually took...
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   I tried the 30 day challenge of no work November.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   What?
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   You can't do that?
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Yeah, I took a vacation for the month of November.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   And it turns out I suck at not working.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   I couldn't do it.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   I'm so excited to see.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   Yeah, you need something.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   I still serve all the tech news.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   So, it's like, well, I might as well get paid to do that.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   So, 30 days of no work usually means 30 days of no paycheck.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   But you probably knowing you and what a workaholic you are,
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   you probably accumulated a lot of vacation time.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   Yeah, I was actually bumping up against the cap at Google.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yep.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   And so, I said, you know what, relatives are coming,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   Thanksgiving's coming.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Let's just take a little bit of time off.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   Now, do you have a good team that you can...
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   Or do you have to get everything done before you leave?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   How does that work for you?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   It's really fantastic.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   Things ran like clockwork while I was gone.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   You know, everybody's like, oh, Matt's away.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Everybody starts spamming.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   But, you know, it's not the case.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   They catch all the spam regardless.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   I do have a joke with my team that every time I go on vacation,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   Google's stock price goes up.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   And it held true.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Oh, really?
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   Wow.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   I should just, you know, take a longer vacation.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Everybody's like, no, no, it's fine, really.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Pretty much any time the sun comes up, Google's stock goes up.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   So, that's not... that's a safe bet on that one.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   I guess it's been a... yeah.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   It's been a pretty strong, pretty high flier.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   Yep.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Now, at $1,058.18 a share.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   Wow.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   And that is pretty impressive.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   Kind of crazy.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   60 to that.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   Yeah, did it hit 1060?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   1060.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   1068 was the high 52-week high.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   So, you're bumping up against the 52-week high.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   Not that I follow stocks in any way or know anything about it.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   But you're not as...
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   You're actually challenging Bitcoin at this point.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   Let's put it that way.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Better track soon.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   It's not clear what's worth more.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   It looks like right now Bitcoin is worth more than a share of Google.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   It's at $11.93.50.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   How many Bitcoins are there in the universe?
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   How many shares of Google are there in the universe?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   Ah, that's a good question.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   I know the total number of Bitcoin, I think, is capped at $21 million.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   But that's kind of irrelevant because Bitcoins are infinitely sliceable unlike a Google stock.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   Okay, Google.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   How many Bitcoins are there?
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   Are you using the Chrome version of that?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   Yes, of course I have.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   Of course you are.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   It didn't give me an answer.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Let me try it.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   Oh, I'm not using Chrome.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   I'm using Safari.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   I don't get to do it.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   And my Moto X is in the other room.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   Hey, good deal if you wanted a Moto X, the unsubsidized price of a Moto G, which is pretty similar to a Moto X.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   Just a little bit slower is now, I think, $179.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   That's a good price, boy.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   Just shows you.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   Just shows you.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   There was, well, the Moto X was also unsubsidized on sale, but they had a major problem on the day of sale.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   What was that?
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   It was a Cyber Monday offer.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   People were supposed to come in and get any other offers.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   And it just, it was like, my joke on Twitter was that this is what they get for having the White House build.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   It was $150 discount, but nobody could get it.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   So they're rerunning the promotion, by the way.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   If you wanted it, you'll have two more chances to get an unlocked, unsubsidized Moto X for $350, very much like the Nexus 5.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   So it started at 9 o'clock this morning.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Yeah, they've already sold out for today.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Oh!
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   So if you want a Moto X, and that's what my primary phone is, a Moto X.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   I love the Moto X.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   9am Pacific, noon, I think.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Monday.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Yep.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   That's the next chance to get it.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   How long did it take to sell out, you know?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   I checked just before the show, and it was already sold out.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   So it only took at most a few hours.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Wow.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Did they say how many?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   What is the number that they have?
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   They increased the number, whatever it was.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   Yeah, they said they doubled the number or something.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   I've read a lot of stories that say the Moto X sales are disappointing, but then there was another good story that said, no, that was like the last three weeks of the quarter, and that was on one carrier where they had Moto Maker, and so now it's a lot more available.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   So it seems like a lot of people are getting them.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   I thought, I love it, and I try them all.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   I had all the phones, all the hot phones.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   I like the Nexus 5 a lot, but I stick with the Moto X.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   It's got KitKat now, and I just because of the additional little features, and I have Jeff sent his back.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   But I think I consider the Nexus 5 I'm pleased with at an equal price.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Maybe the features might have pushed me to the Moto X.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   I'm not, it's not negative on the Moto X.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   I just wanted to hold out for the Nexus 5.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   Yeah, and the Nexus 5 has a bigger screen, arguably a better screen because it's much higher resolution.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   And there's no question it has a much better camera.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   The Moto X camera is still disappoints, unfortunately.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   However, all in all, just because of the size and the features, I try as I might.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   And you know me, I change phones a lot.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   This phone is the key on me.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   I can't get rid of it.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   So I'm pretty happy with it.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   Certainly, I think I thought at the time, and I still think this, it's a phone that's going to be a sleeper.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   I also think that we're due for an upgrade.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   I would not be surprised to see a 1080p Moto X in the next few months.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   Oh, that would be...
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   I just feel like that's, that we got to be getting close to that.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   I actually broke my Moto X on Halloween.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   My costume didn't have any pockets on the bathroom floor.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   Wait, wait, wait, what were you about?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   I was the dread pirate Robert.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   I was the silk road version.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   You were loaded with Bitcoin.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   Yeah, I was going to trade Bitcoins.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   And I had Iocaine powder in one pocket.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   So I dropped my Moto X.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   I actually bought a new one at full price, the developer version, because I was like, yeah, the Moto X is...
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   And I am on Verizon. The Nexus 5 is not on Verizon.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   So that's one tricky part.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   But it's a really great...
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   Verizon!
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   You even grew a mustache for this.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   I did, yes.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   Look at that.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   A little bit of the pencil mustache.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   I was...
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   My wife had tights or tegings, or I don't know what you call them, but they didn't have pockets.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   And so I tried to put the phone in the gloves and then they just fell right out.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   Looks good.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Looks good.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   And the Iocaine in the pocket, very handy.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   I had a sword left over from being an Eagle Montoya a few years ago.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   My name is an Eagle Montoya.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   This is not so very different, frankly, from the Eagle Montoya costume.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   No, it's a pretty similar costume.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Some black stuff.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   The lines are different.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   That's about it.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   That's about it.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   So I was...
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   Now, I just want to...
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   I'll just put my own horn here.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   Because when Andy Rubin left the Android group and they said, well, he's going to go to a moon shot,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   I immediately said, I bet he's going to robotics.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   Remember that, Jeff?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   Yep, you did.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   You did boss.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   You knew that he had job experience in the field, but more importantly, he had a love of robotics
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   that apparently you see at his house where robots did everything from answer the door to make the coffee.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   Well, now according to John Markoff of the New York Times, Google and Andy Rubin are working on robots.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   They've acquired kind of...
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Seven companies.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Quietly.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Seven companies.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   To do robots, including by the way, robot drones that can deliver stuff.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   So take that, Jeff.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   Jeff Bezos.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   I think this is really cool.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   Now, apparently, the focus will be on robots to do manufacture, not consumer robots.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   You need to be.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Yeah, but that's a little disappointing.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   Well, what it is to me about the stories is the idea of Google getting into warehousing.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Amazon style warehousing.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   Yeah, that was fascinating as an angle here.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   What would Google keep in those warehouses?
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   Hard drives.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   Who knows?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   Lots of glasses.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   Well, it would become a facilitator of commerce.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Google's not going to change their business model so much that they're going to become an Amazon competitor, however.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   Well, but in the long run, what is advertising but selling stuff?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   And the closer you get to the transaction, the more you know.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   The more you facilitate the transaction, the more you know.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   I find it all because it's such a specialized business, it's so expensive.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   Which it's weird you have Amazon and Google meet in the middle, right?
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   Because Google just announced new discounts and a lot more for its cloud service.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   And a more heavy competition with Amazon Web Services.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   And so who knows?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   And I guess if you're going to sell autonomous vehicles, you need somewhere to keep them.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   All those car-driven cars or something.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   This is the point where we say that while Matt cuts works for Google, he's not representing Google at this point and anything he says cannot be used against him in a court of law.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   Right.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   So, Andy on the campus once in a while, he's even...
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   I saw him in downtown Los Altos one day.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   There was some story that was claiming that he had a secret office in downtown Los Altos or something.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   And you could sort of look up the stairway and see some humanoid robot figure.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   And so I actually did walk down and I was like, you could kind of peer up into the window and see something.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   It's a pretty neat little Easter egg.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   But it seems like a pretty intriguing idea.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   You know, Larry and Sergey and all those guys have always been interested in energy and transportation and hard science stuff landing on the moon.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   So things like robots, you can definitely see where that would appeal to them.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   As far as warehousing, one thing that I've been really impressed with lately is Google Shopping Express.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   And that's working with retailers and trying to find ways to let the retailers get the existing products that they've already been able to get.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   And so I've had a conversation with eBay about the stuff, eBay PayPal, and for local advertising and such.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   And the challenge to right extent is to get local merchants to put their inventory on in a form that is readable so that you can sell it.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   And so Google, I would think, could be a master.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   And so Google is a master.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   And so Google is a master.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   You know, Google, I would think, could be a master at helping companies create databases of their stuff.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   What do you have in stock? What is available for sale right now?
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   Then, you know, delivery or sale is kind of a short hop.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   But knowing what you have to sell is a data challenge.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   So if you're in the Northern California, which is the only place Google Shopping Express works,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   a bunch of merchants involved with this.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   Mostly, I mean, they're all brick and mortar, all of them, most of them, as you'd expect with almost anybody these days, do sell online as well.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   So what is Google, is this like a group on kind of thing for Google?
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   No, it's more like, so for example, this weekend I was putting up my Christmas lights.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   And so I was using some Scotch masking tape and I finished out the roll.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And there's an app or a webpage where you basically say, "Okay, I want, you know, Scotch masking tape."
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   And there's a local Walgreens nearby and they're like, "Okay, it's $1.99."
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   And it's either, you know, free delivery or it depends on when you joined and what sort of a member you are.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   But you can basically say, "Yes, I want this masking tape delivered to me, you know, three hours later or 6 p.m. tonight."
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   And it saves me the errand, you know. So anytime you would be ready to do that.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Wait, wait, wait. So did you have masking tape delivered to your house?
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   How imperial can you get that time?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   Bring me the masking tape!
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   So I went ahead and ordered three of them so that it wouldn't be just like, "Hey, here's a piece of gum."
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   But it's surprisingly convenient.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   And once you start doing it, you're like, "Wow, this is, you know, instead of the 20 minutes to run to the store, I can go and tackle something else."
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   You're kind of like, "Hey, this is really nice."
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Or like, you want to get big 24 packs of water delivered instead of hoping it yourself and hurting your back.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Someone will just drop that right here.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   Can't be cost effective though. I mean, really.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   So here's a Sriracha, normally 250, a Buck 99.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   I'm going to add that to my card. It's from Knob Hill.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   Now, is there a big gold delivery fee? Let's just see if I can get a little Sriracha delivered.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   Delivery is free, nominally 499.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   There's also a $10 first order credit.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   It's going to go out of manufacture, Leo, because it's causing stink in the neighborhood where it's made.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   So order some more, Leo.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   And you get a free trial membership.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   You need a Google wallet.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   Right, but you've got that. Leo, if Petaluma is in the delivery area.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   It's not a lass.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   Oh, sadly. Okay.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   But it's pretty interesting to sign up because during this sort of trial area, our trial period,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   it's pretty fascinating how quickly you get used to it if you don't have to worry as much about the delivery fees.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Now, there will be a delivery fee eventually.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   So they're working with retailers, right?
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   Yes.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   That's it exactly.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   And who does the delivery? Does Google or does Walmart or whatever?
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   Google does the delivery.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   Google does the work with existing retailers to go through the back or even pull something off of the shelf and then just bring it right to your door.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   You know, I had this fantasy.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   I saw a picture of one of these guys doing it and I thought, you know, he calls home and says, "Mom, Dad, I'm working for Google."
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Yay, son, you finally made good. What are you doing?
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   I'm delivering masking tape to some Imperial guy who wants to...
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   (laughter)
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   Not exactly the internship you were hoping for.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   (laughter)
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   I just don't understand why Google's getting in this business.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   This is historically a very tough business.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   Amazon has never made no money ever because they invest everything they make back into building, what is it?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   More than 90 distribution centers.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Truly. But here's a big difference.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   Amazon competes with local retailers.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   Watch out Jeff Bezos. Watch it in post.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   eBay serves local retailers and trying to get them on more.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   Google does.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   There's going to be a big one.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   eBay does.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   eBay.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   So Google comes into this and Google's going to go on the eBay side of that and say, "Well, we're also going to, I think, so far, they're saying we're going to serve the retailers."
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   So what is Google's end of the business here?
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   They have to run a fleet of trucks.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   There's useful data.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   And you think about the routing algorithms, you know, in order to deliver packages effectively.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   That's kind of like when you say, "I want to go from one address to another address and you want to do that efficiently."
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   Except it's multiple points, multiple deliveries, you know, it quickly becomes an actual computer science problem.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   But you don't.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   Well, maybe you do.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   You tell me.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   Does Google do stuff just because it's an interesting problem?
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   A lot of engineers.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   [laughter]
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   But I don't think Larry and Sergey would pursue it if they didn't see an end goal that they thought was worth it.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   You don't turn it into a business just because it's an...
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   Well, and I watched the 60 Minutes interview with Jeff Bezos, and I thought it was fascinating.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   And one of the things they pointed out is that the bins in the fulfillment centers are contained, but apparently random items.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   The algorithm is to pack it.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   So they fit as many things as they can into those bins, and it's purely based on the size and dimensions of the item.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   And then they trust their automated systems to get the item, the proper item from the...
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   It's basically how I do my wine cellar.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   [laughter]
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   I actually spent some time thinking about this.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.200]   What would be the best way to map out a wine cellar so that you would know exactly where the wine you want was?
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   So I created a fleet of robots.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   [laughter]
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   It's an interesting problem.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   It just seems like a strange business for Google to get into, because they're not selling the product.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   They're not stocking the product.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   They're in the delivery.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   They're a fulfillment center.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   The next step is self-driving vehicles.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   Or drones.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   I don't believe that to you.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   Google is also doing drones according to the L.A. Times.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   Amazon, of course, and I think Jeff Bezos just was playing Charlie Rose in 60 Minutes when he showed the Amazon drones.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Oh my God!
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   They're glods, and Charlie.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   But yeah, he was so impressed without, of course, thinking of the issue of, for instance, these unprotected eight rotor blades flying through the air at eye level at your house.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   But apparently, UPS and Google, according to unnamed sources, are testing and evaluating different ways they could out drones to delivery vehicles.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   UPS has not confirmed the report, but says it's an interesting technology and will continue to evaluate it.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   Reports from as far back as February by nine to five Google say Google has been testing mini drone delivery systems that I would like to use with Google Shopping Express.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   You know, fast forward 10 or 15 years.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   I hope not.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   I don't want to live in a world where there's competing copters flying around.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   Well, maybe it's not drones. Maybe it is self-driving cars and Andy Rubens robots, you know? Who knows?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   It does, you know, I mean drones save you money over trucks.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   You know, despite all the complications of this.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   But again, it seems like there are other businesses that would be quicker and easier to enter than this very challenging kind of hybrid brick and mortar business.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   But so do you think that Andy's working on stuff like the shopping?
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   I really don't know.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   But you know, it does seem like he's been interested in robots for a long time.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   You know, even some of the earliest stories about him mentioned how well his house is wired up.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   No, it was it seemed to me that if Andy Rubens is going to leave Android, why the name of the Android is Android.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   And I'm sure Andy had something to do with that. If the name of if the energy is going to leave Android to do a moonshot,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   seems like the first thing I'd put him at that do, you know, is.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   Well, philosophically, I think Matt did touch on it.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   Is the time that Matt saved not going to the Walgreens to get the mask contained.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   It's freed up his time. And that's what we constantly hear from from Larry and Sergey is, is freeing up the human capital of time and attention.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   Well, I understand, you know, if you're Amazon and you're trying to compete against a brick and mortar,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   the only thing a brick and mortar offers that you don't is the ability to go get it and have it today.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Right.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   And so it makes perfect sense for Amazon to be exploring whatever means it can for same day delivery.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   That's just same.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   Amazon is challenged. Amazon is challenged. How many data warehouse, I mean, how many physical warehouses can they build in close proximity to how much population versus
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   if Google and or eBay contain the inventory that already exists in the field and then can turn around and say, I have an order from asking tape.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   Mr. Cots doesn't care where it comes from. Who wants this order? Who's going to give me the best price for this?
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   We'll come pick it up. We'll take it to Mr. Cots and we'll take our cut of Mr. Cots order along the way.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   But it starts a marketplace of physical sales. And if you can enable that, that's powerful.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   I mean, you pay to have pizza delivered to you.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   If something sufficiently interesting or useful to you compared to pizza or saves you the time of making dinner or saves you time.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   Pizza you have to have delivered to you because if you shipped it by a truck, it wouldn't take too long.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   But actually there is a food service at Petaluma, Petaluma Food Taxi that supports many of the restaurants in town and I use it at least weekly.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   We showed the video from Pizza Hut beating Amazon to the punch delivering a pizza by drone.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Right.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   But, yeah, it just seems like this is a business Google's not in. It's kind of like the healthcare website because the challenge is if you don't control the products is in coordinating all these disparate databases, having them somehow interface with you.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   And I'm saying Leo, if it's a data problem, I understand.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   It's like Open Table has become the point of sale reservation service for every restaurant.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   They intended to do it as a consumer service. They found that their real business was handling the back end for every restaurant.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   And then the front end consumer business became an add-on, a gravy.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   Right.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   And I would argue at some point that if Google as a data service says to every retailer, use, I mean, they don't have this yet.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   I would say that they and eBay were going to be in a fight to say we become your inventory management system.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   And if we have your inventory, look what they can do with that.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   And then they don't need warehouses. They don't need inventory risks. They don't need all of that.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   They'll just say, we'll sell whoever has the damn masking tape.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   As long as we can interface with their systems and that we can, you know,
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   well, we are their system. No, no, no, I'm saying we are their system.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   We provide the system.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   And I want to emphasize like Amazon, they have their own warehouses and Google Shop and Express explicitly says let's work with retailers.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Right.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   But what I've been impressed about is number one, if they say they have a product, they don't come back later and say,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   oh, it turns out we don't have that product. Someone took it off the shelf. That's been pretty good.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   And just the fact that you can actually schedule a delivery window, I mean, I don't know about you, but I often spend a lot of my weekend doing errands.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   And if I can knock those out and, you know, pay us very small fee or maybe even no fee.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Oh, I agree.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   Then that time is worth, you know, something.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   That's why as Harry Lyman, our chat room says a lot of science fiction featured pneumatic tubes.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   Because it would just your sriracha sauce.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   Oh, I love some things on newspapers.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   Oh, we came back drunk from the bar of the things we would put in it.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Oh, God.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   I really wanted to get a new man. I actually researched a pneumatic tube system for here.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   Oh, it would have been great. Oh, it would have been beautiful.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   I really wanted that. I still do.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   When they arrive, it's that whoop.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   Right.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   Which is great.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   And what, so what you see in that, what I just said is what really is happening at Google.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   Because I have fantasies about things I would like to do, but of course, don't have the resources to do it.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   What if you took people and you gave them infinite resources and said, now what do you want to do?
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   Pneumatic tubes to every home in the United States is not so far fetched.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   With a little fiber attached to it.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   Yeah, a little fiber tube.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   You know, it might be more sensible for both Jeff Bezos and Larry Page to start working on,
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   what do they call them, a Star Trek where they make the food for you?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   Oh, the synthesizer.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   Yes, I'm sort of synthesizing.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   Food 3D food printers.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   3D food printers.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   Well, Sergey kind of is, right, his hamburger.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   Of course, that's right.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   Of course.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   Replicators, that's it.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   Yep.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   I want to just put a replicator in every home you don't need to deliver anything.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   How hard could that be?
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   Well, we also have a story in here that Google's going to grow plants on the moon.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   And it just lets you think this is pie in the sky.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Well, it is in the sky.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Or Brussels sprouts in the sky.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   It is with the help of NASA.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   NASA.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   Or NASA with the help of Google and really more to the case, part of the SpaceX project.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   They're going to put up a pod up there that's going to plant some seeds and see how they
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   do.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   Once the lander arrives on the moon, water will be added to basil, turnip, and a rabbit
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   dulpsis, a small flowering plant, seeds kept in the habitat, then monitored for five to
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   ten days and compared to controls back on the earth.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   NASA will also monitor the actual habitat itself.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   Wow.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   Currently...
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   In all of the...
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   No, wait a minute.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   I think it qualifies as evil to spread turnips in the universe.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   Currently, the chamber can support ten basil seeds, ten turnip seeds, but one hundred arabidopsis
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.200]   seeds.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   It also holds a little bit of water.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   So it's a small project, a pilot project.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   Just a little tiny matter of putting something on the moon.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:33.640]   I think, Jeff, contrary to what you've just asserted, the turnip is a perfect food.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.120]   It may not be palatable.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.560]   It's only slightly better than what I consider a product of radioactivity, which is the Brussels
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   sprout.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.560]   I love the Brussels sprout.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   You would.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   To each his own.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.480]   Oh, God, they're awful.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:56.800]   I think I could do a Google search on the nutritional value of a turnip.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   It might be just a pure starch, but it just seems to me that a turnip might also be a
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640]   perfect protein.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   You never know.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   Okay, Google.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   What is the nutritional value of a turnip?
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.920]   Thirty-four calories per medium turnip.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.400]   Seize low cal.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.360]   No very little fat, cholesterol, or sodium.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.000]   Nice potassium load.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.480]   Eight grams of carbohydrates.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:26.120]   No vitamin A, little vitamin, so a lot of vitamin C. It's a high in vitamin C.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.600]   They'll make soy that's it.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.520]   Turnips, where they make it taste better.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   Soylent turnips.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:36.600]   Well, I figured turnip is like the basic root that you could pump into a replicator,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:44.360]   turnip puree, and anything could be made of it from steak to hot wheels.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.960]   It's like the ultimate raw material is a turnip.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   There.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.080]   Oh, now let's do a Wolfram Alpha comparing a turnip to a Brussels sprout.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.440]   This is Google that you can do versus and it'll show you.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.640]   So turnips are much lower calorie, much lower fat.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   What's the quotient of evil?
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   A little more sodium, a little less potassium, lower carb, high in fiber, not as much as
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   a turnip.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.160]   I mean a Brussels sprout is.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.880]   I don't know if we've learned anything here.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.000]   How about versus French fry?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   A turnip that verches versus...
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.800]   What about a turnip fry?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:35.240]   I bet if we grew up in an alternate university, we would have turnip fries.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.840]   It's a root vegetable, you slice it up.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   Yep.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   Oh, recipes.com.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   Crispy turnip fries recipe.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.800]   That kind of weird result.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.640]   Roodabaga versus French fry.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.600]   Obviously it's a turnip.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   That's a turnip.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   Is that a Roodabaga?
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   I don't know.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.360]   That's maybe a bug report.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.600]   I could choose between boil.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   I don't know.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.320]   Roasted turnips with Parmesan.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.760]   No, that's quite good actually because of the Parmesan.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.360]   That turnip is just a substrate.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.640]   It's like a... it's really a Parmesan holder.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:13.080]   All right, Andy Rubin, get to work.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.720]   Make something with turnips.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   Roodabaga is a type of turnip.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   And to be honest, I frankly don't care.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   Gina, Gina, come back.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   Look how far we're going off.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   Gina, you must be here.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.280]   So what did you think of the...
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   Jeff...
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   What did you think of the Jeff Bezos drone reveal?
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.600]   Was that pure theater?
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.080]   Was he serious about it?
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.960]   Is Amazon really going to ever deliver stuff with drones or Google?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.480]   I was a vision that he was telling...
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.120]   It was making a joke on Charlie and then it felt bad and couldn't say, "I'm joshing
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   to hear fella."
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   Is he kidding, Charlie?
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   No, I think the...
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.040]   I mean, I think Jeff was sincere.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.080]   I think he saw it in his mind.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:06.280]   It'll be apparent to anyone that this is purely blue sky research and that we are not
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.760]   anywhere close to actually getting these off the ground.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   But they do.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.480]   I mean, they have a video that shows it working.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   And imagine taking stuff to a remote village.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   Imagine using drones to take...
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.080]   It's been used according to the MIT technology review.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.320]   It has been used in Haiti.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.480]   So, it is in fact...
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.320]   Drone delivery is a reality.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.240]   It's not imaginary.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.920]   It's got its problems.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.320]   There's some issues involved.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.560]   They talk to a professor of aneronics at MIT.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.000]   Technically, it's totally feasible.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.480]   Of course, the question is, will the FAA allow it?
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.480]   And they should, says John Hansman, professor of aeronautics.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:59.800]   And if the business case makes sense, the he thinks it would cost a lot.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.240]   You'd have to pay a lot for that.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:12.040]   But MatterNet, which is a singularity university funded project and Aria logistics, which is
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.160]   building an autonomous logistics infrastructure is working on this kind of thing.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   But instead of putting them on the front sidewalk, they would put them on predetermined pads.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.040]   Which seems like that would solve the haircut problem.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.640]   They can go like 30 miles at a pop and go and just go pad to pad to pad.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:36.520]   MatterNet delivered tested drones as a way to deliver supplies to refugee camps in Haiti.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.360]   They found it cost only 20 to 70 cents to deliver a 2 kilogram package 10 kilometers,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.320]   which is five times less expensive, one-fifth the cost of a truck.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   So they...
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.440]   I mean, this is not completely pie in the sky.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:55.160]   Don't imagine things like organ transplant.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.720]   Get that liver out here.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.440]   After you have the turnips and you need it.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   Here is a...
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.640]   Boy, I just think we like the idea of these quadcopters, these autonomous drones.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   Here's a drone delivering to a refugee camp in Porto Prince.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.080]   God, stand back.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.360]   I was talking to Tim Poole.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.480]   He's a wonderful guy who...
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.600]   He's the guy who livestreamed Akama Wall Street for 21 hours.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:36.000]   And he said that he would never use a titanium-wirly drone because it could kill somebody.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Right.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   But if you use the smaller drones with a little plastic...
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.600]   Yeah, the rubber drone.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.360]   What he really wants, and he's right, is you want to blimp on top of that.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   Oh.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.280]   Like, why so it doesn't just drop?
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   Right.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   A balloon drop.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.320]   Yeah, so it's a tiny dirgable.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.080]   Or make him out of Nerf.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.360]   Nobody was ever hurt by a Nerf drone.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.760]   It's heard of drones.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.920]   We've got it.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.040]   Some of the, you know, the parrot quadcopter has that sort of foam to protect it.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.160]   And then, you know, Chris Anderson and 3D Robotics, they're really big into drones.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.240]   And there's been some interesting stuff with drones where you can buy them as a service.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.680]   And they'll basically take a picture of your farm or your vineyard or whatever with very
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.760]   high resolution, a horse and meter resolution and stitch that together.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.600]   And then you can do that as an overlay on a Google map or something like that.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:33.160]   And so, and you can just basically define, this is the path or this is the, you know,
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.080]   the outline of what I want you to take a picture of.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.320]   And so, you know, it's one of these things where we're all laughing about drones right
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.800]   up until they kind of materialize and turn out to be pretty realistic.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.880]   We will live in the future any minute now.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.080]   My cuts is here from Google.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   We're talking about Google.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.360]   Jeanette Trappani has the month off.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.120]   I'm sad to say as she moves to relocate to Brooklyn, but she'll be back with us.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   I'm happy about that.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.040]   I'm very happy because he's, she's going to be happier in Williamsburg or wherever she's
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.600]   going.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   Happier in the Brooklyn.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.520]   Actually, I don't know where in Brooklyn.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.640]   Are show today brought to you by Atlassian?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   Oh, I should.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   Oh, I should.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   Oh, I guess there's no.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.240]   I was going to do a little contest.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:23.480]   What is used by over 20,000 companies, including 70% of the Fortune 500, 70% of the Fortune
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:33.440]   100 and NASA, what can be used to follow code development from through delivery in one
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:40.160]   system using Git, what can be used with REST APIs to track your project, to track your
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.680]   code, to keep track of what you're doing.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   It's Atlassian's JIRA project management software.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   JIRA is one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.760]   systems, capturing and organizing your workflow so you can prioritize and take action on what's
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.280]   important while staying up to date with the activity going on around you.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.960]   As you know, these projects are hard to manage, but a tool like JIRA can make such a difference.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   You can easily capture, organize and prioritize your team's issues, tasks, features, bugs.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.800]   It works with Git, as I mentioned.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.600]   You're not giving up your source code repository.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.640]   It's just a simple intuitive interface for collaborating with other team levels in real
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   time.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.920]   And, of course, seamlessly integrating your planning documents, your backlog, your issues,
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.800]   and your code repository, wherever it might be, all in one platform.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.680]   Set up any business process you're going to manage.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.080]   So your team works the way you want.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.720]   I'm fascinated by this stuff.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.040]   The same way we're using technology to solve these problems and things like logistics and
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.360]   package delivery, technology makes such a big difference when you're working together
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.000]   on a big project.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.400]   Use email chat to stay in the loop.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.120]   You can even use Twitter mentions or RSS, monitor streams of activity, or self-updating
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.280]   reports and dashboards.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.640]   You're always in the know.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:04.000]   And, of course, as your project grows, you can grow infinitely in any direction with hundreds
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.800]   of JIRA add-ons, including test management, time tracking, project management, many, many,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.640]   many more.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.400]   If you've got code, JIRA ties everything together from an initial planning document to the files
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.720]   and change sets in your code repository right through to the disk deployment.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.520]   JIRA, flexible enough for a five-person startup, powerful enough for a hundred thousand-person
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   enterprise.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.360]   That's why so many use JIRA.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:39.720]   But we want you to try it by going, you get it free for 30 days, going to Atlassian.com/twig,
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.880]   A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com/twig.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.840]   For more information on JIRA, monthly plans started $10 a month for up to 10 users, so
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.640]   it's very affordable, but free for the first 30 days.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.840]   Atlassian.com/twig, try JIRA today.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.440]   Comes from Gojira, the Japanese name for Godzilla.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440]   Gojira.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:13.400]   Speaking of the cloud, Google, as you mentioned, you kind of touched on this Jeff Jarvis is
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.200]   slashing prices on its compute cloud.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.120]   Going again against Amazon, this is another thing Amazon does.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.760]   Google's got the compute engine, a year and a half old.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.680]   Now I guess that was a preview.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.080]   It's now generally, I didn't realize this because I know so many people use it.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:39.040]   It's now generally available, including an SLA that guarantees 99.95% uptime.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:44.320]   16 core instances, faster persistent disks.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:50.080]   This is so cool that you can have a 16 core compute cloud.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.360]   Just think of all the things.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:58.040]   Now, compute engine is a commercial product.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.560]   Do you have any information on this, Matt?
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.880]   Well, just the standard, I know for a long time people have wanted to be able to use
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.480]   Google infrastructure to do their sort of tasks, whether it's storage or computing or
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   whatever.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.320]   Now, we're sort of filling that out.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.440]   You can sort of see that picture of whether it's data storage or querying over that storage
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.160]   or doing large scale computation, whatever it is we want to be able to do.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   This makes sense to me.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.520]   I mean, you've had App Engine since 2008.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.000]   This just makes sense.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.360]   I mean, Google's got the-- they've solved the infrastructure problem.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   Snapchat uses compute engine, E-Vite, Wix.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:44.000]   So this seems like a business that makes sense for Google to be in compared to shopping.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.200]   I mean, because you've got the infrastructure.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:54.400]   Is it like CompuServe was, which H&R block had a bunch of computers they weren't using?
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   They said, well, we'll rent these out.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.840]   I mean, if you think about it, we have a lot more computers than almost anyone else.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.760]   And so we use those computers a lot.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.880]   But we also know an awful lot about utilization, how to get the most out of the CPU and the
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   RAM.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.000]   You want to have enough so that you can have some spikes, but you don't want to waste
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.600]   that CPU and that RAM.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.680]   And so there's a lot of wiggle room there where you can bring in people who want to
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   do computing jobs.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.120]   And it's relatively minor compared to Google's overall fleet of computers.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.400]   And so we can fold that in and have it run and be available in a very highly persistent
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   way.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   Right.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.840]   But will it be sentient like Stephen Rufram's compute cluster?
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   That's the question.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   Yeah, we need to make sure all our code names are cute and cuddly, not like Skynet or the
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   perrier.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.120]   You've got to be careful.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.760]   You've got to be careful.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.520]   No, I think this really is very powerful, empowering technology that makes it possible.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.480]   Well, for like these two guys at Stanford to create Snapchat, they didn't have to have
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   they didn't have to.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.560]   You know, I remember when Kevin Rose set up dig and what a big deal it was to find a
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.040]   colo and to get the servers and to provision the servers, you had to do almost all the
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.240]   heavy lifting yourself and you had to raise money because it was very expensive.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.680]   And so it kept people from just trying ideas.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   The reliability of blogger at the beginning, we nearly died by people were ready to scream
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.160]   for him and he poor guys just trying to throw in some more chewing gum into his servers.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.400]   Yeah, it was a big it's a big deal.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   And now you can be Snapchat.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.360]   You can just be a couple of frat brothers in Stanford and you go, hey, we don't have
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.400]   to do any of that.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.880]   Just use a compute engine.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.600]   Well, I think there's a feature server more than it's going to go on to two weeks ago.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:52.200]   We didn't talk about it on the show, but but Amazon AWS announced new high reliability
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:58.040]   fast delivery of things like games and high data applications so that you could put more
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.560]   on the cloud less on the on the end, share things in new ways.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.800]   I think we're going to find more services adding on to the cloud world that will enable
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.920]   tons on untold numbers of companies to use those that functionality to build new things.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.760]   You know, Eric Schmidt talks about how some of the limits of the early technology companies
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.440]   were based on the regulatory nature of what you could get over T1.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.200]   That's right.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.680]   So when you open things up and you create this new functionality as true platforms,
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   it's huge.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.880]   What innovators can do will be amazing.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   Huge.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   And when we're already seeing it, I mean, that's, that's why, you know, what is Snapchat
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.200]   is worth $3 billion in just a couple of years or Instagrams worth a billion dollars, a couple
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.640]   of engineers and Instagrams worth a billion dollars.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:45.280]   Think Instagram uses S3 and I remember talking to a Brett Taylor way back when he was a product
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.840]   manager before, you know, Facebook and, you know, he would sort of, I think he had a
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.800]   pool of friends that he, they got together and had a shared server.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.640]   And you know, you think back to 2007.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.440]   So hard to do.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.160]   You know, you're doing all that stuff by hand.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.720]   You shouldn't have to deal with that sort of minutia if you're just trying to set up a
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   service.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   So.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.120]   Well, it's the difference between pumping your own water and bringing it to the kitchen
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.360]   and turning on the faucet.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.040]   It's just, it's a huge difference in the capabilities and that's exciting.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:20.480]   I'm, I'm thrilled to hear that there's competition because that keeps prices down.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.440]   And so far, and they're, and it's not just Google and Amazon.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   There's rack space.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.480]   There's a lot of companies doing this now.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:34.840]   I guess I should bring this up since we have the, the king himself, smartphone crawling
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.440]   errors in the webmaster tools.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   Right.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   What is that?
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.520]   This is something we just did a blog post earlier today about this.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.760]   So if you go back and you look at Black Friday and Cyber Monday's stats, you'll see a lot
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.160]   of people saying, you know, mobile was an unexpectedly large amount of traffic.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.560]   It was like a 187% growth.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   You're over here.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.480]   Over and over again at search conferences, I say mobile is coming faster than you expect
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   to get ready for it.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.000]   And yet people really haven't.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.600]   And so you look at these stats and they're like, Oh, IBM says, you know, this much more
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.680]   came from mobile.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.920]   And if you try to buy things on a mobile phone, it's really frustrating.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.280]   So we're trying to help webmasters and site owners and publishers figure out how to get
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.160]   ready for a mobile world.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.960]   And one of the most common mistakes that people make is things work fine on the desktop.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.880]   But whenever you go to a smartphone, you get redirected to an error page or you always
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.640]   go to the same page.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:35.160]   And so we're basically just surfacing whenever we crawl as a regular desktop user as Google
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.400]   bot versus as a mobile phone, what sort of strange behaviors do we see that you might
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   want to fix?
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.920]   So it's not like this is web spam or anything like that, but it is like, you know, if you
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.440]   have an unusually large number of errors, then you want to think about, OK, what am I doing
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   wrong?
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.640]   I need to go and fix things so that it works fine for smartphones.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   How common it is?
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.240]   I get the faulty redirect a lot on mobile.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   It's really common.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.120]   Like, so far, mobile is still the unloved stepchild.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.280]   And it's like, this is the stepchild who's like the overachiever genius and yet no one
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.160]   is really paying attention to it.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.000]   And so with time, you know, things will get allocated correctly and appropriately.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.240]   But right now people don't realize how much mobile matters.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.360]   And so for example, there's a request auto complete and there's a new service from Google
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   to let you buy with Google Wallet.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:27.000]   Like something like 1% of transactions that are mobile end up succeeding because people
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.960]   are like, oh, I'm not going to type in my form, you know, while I'm on a mobile phone.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.320]   And so there's a lot of stuff coming down the pipe that like request auto complete that
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.720]   turns it into like two clicks to fill out a form.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.520]   And if your website enables that, it just lowers the friction for buying things on the
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.720]   tablet or on a phone.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.760]   Well, that's the plug to use Google services.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.600]   But also you probably should fix these errors in general.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.840]   Or, you know, responsive design, just, you know, employ a tablet or a phone and make
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.240]   sure that your website doesn't look completely sucky.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.800]   Like that's level one.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   Just do that.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.440]   And I still, I mean, I'm still guilty of this.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.000]   I have a mobile site on my blog, my personal blog, as well as a desktop site.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.600]   And that's so 2006.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.840]   I mean, it really should have a single design, right?
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.760]   It can still work, you know, but if you don't think about mobile at all, then it's probably
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   going to come back to you.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   Right.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.240]   So this is one thing I've been wondering about is a lot of people still include tablets and
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   mobile.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.160]   And I don't, tablets to me are the new laptops.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.440]   How does Google look at the terms of traffic?
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.680]   How do you categorize what mobile means?
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.640]   That is really tricky because is it by resolution or is it by screen size and different people,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.960]   whether it's Google Analytics or Webmaster Tools, might have slightly different opinions
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   about that.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.200]   That's something that we'll still have to figure out exactly because, you know, it even goes
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.920]   down to Android versus Chrome.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.960]   You know, for a long time, it was like, well, Chrome is the thing that has a keyboard, you
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   know?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   Right.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.400]   But, you know, that distinction doesn't make as much sense as the devices start to converge.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:05.760]   So even if you handle smartphones, normally tablets will still work okay.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.640]   So it's worth doing some thinking about, but, you know, it depends on how much resources
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   you have.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:18.840]   I'm sorry, I was busy uploading the verification file to my Leo Vilsoi could check for crawling
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.480]   errors in your Webmaster Tools.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   That's great.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   That's a nice feature.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   I have to say.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.200]   And we do use it on the Twit site, but I think this is a...
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.480]   Is this a new verification system?
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   It seems a lot easier than it used to be.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.200]   You know, it turns out one of the main ways that people failed to register with Webmaster
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.920]   Tools is, you know, they didn't know how to upload a file to their site or they didn't
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.120]   know how to change their DNS.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   And so we're just trying to make it easier and easier, even working with some, you know,
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.320]   web hosts so that, like, if you use GoDaddy, it could be like automatically...
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   It's just there.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   All right.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.920]   Well, I shouldn't probably be doing this right now.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.840]   It's still...
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.040]   It's not one click yet.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   We're still...
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.960]   I'll save this for another time, but I'm not doing a show.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.840]   It's great to have you.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.440]   Matt Cutz is here from the Goog as well as, of course, Jeff Jarvis from the City University
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   of New York.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.880]   Jeff's latest book is Public Parts, as you mentioned.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.560]   We didn't want to see his teeth, but there you go.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   Public is public.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.360]   Oh, get back, get back.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.440]   Jeff is also...
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.800]   Two crowns, two crowns.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   Two crowns.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   Was that painful?
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   To the wall, up 3,000 bucks.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Whoa!
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.680]   I've bright cracked one, and then six days later, the one next to it cracked.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   It's...
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.480]   When they go, they start to go go at once.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.400]   Oh, thanks a lot.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   She's...
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Oh.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   That delivers a lot of...
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.640]   Jeff and I are the same agent.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.880]   We're both falling apart, basically.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.040]   We're falling.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.800]   Don't ever get old, Matt.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   Just stay young.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Stay forever young.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   What is your 30-day challenge this month?
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.160]   Well, I'm getting a little older, and so I kind of threw my back out a couple months
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.840]   ago, so my 30-day challenge is to do stretches like cat and animal and try to limber up a
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.840]   little bit.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   Have you found...
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.720]   I mean, the premise of this 30-day challenge for those who don't know is that if you do
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.680]   something, anything, for 30 days, it becomes a habit, and then you can continue to do it.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.280]   I know I'm fiddling with my mic because it's wobbly.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.920]   So that's my 30-day challenge to stop fiddling with myself.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   What?
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.720]   A master of your microphones.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.000]   Master of my domain.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.920]   So what, Matt, have you found in that regard?
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   Are all...
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.400]   I mean, you've done a lot of 30-day challenges now.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.560]   Have they all become part of your life?
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.200]   Well, it lets me take it out for a test drive.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.600]   Like it turns out I don't really want to be vegan, but I really appreciate knowing what
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   it's like to be vegan.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.280]   It's a long time to be vegan.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.400]   So, but I find that the exercise ones tend to stick.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.880]   I've started to actually run more and walk more and bike more.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.040]   And started to take us women class recently.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:07.520]   So that stuff surprisingly sticks, which is a good habit to add to your life.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.520]   So I'm sorry.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.240]   You said you're doing, you're going to do stretches.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   I think that's good.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   I don't stretch enough.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   No one stretches enough.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.720]   Well, and it's, you know, if they're a puta for your back, like cat and camel to try to...
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.840]   We call it cat cow.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   Exactly, yes.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.080]   So you're not slouching forward all day long.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   That kind of stuff.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   Ah, that's good.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.920]   So Matt, was there a challenge that you hated more than any other and couldn't wait until
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.480]   it was over and said, "I'm never doing that again?"
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   No sugar.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Yeah, that's a tough one.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.040]   But do you mean when you say no sugar, you mean no sugar added or just no sugar?
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.240]   Well, no artificial sugar, like grapes were okay.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   Okay.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   But that was sweet stuff.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.880]   But you can't put a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   That's right.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880]   That was pretty hard.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   And I talked to my wife into it.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.680]   So she was very grumpy by the end of the month.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.680]   So...
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.720]   What is the effect of your challenges on your family?
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.040]   Oh, Dad.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.280]   So far it's actually been okay.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.680]   My wife has joined me for...
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.200]   She's sort of been Shanghai'd into doing a couple like the vegan one because it's...
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.600]   If I'm vegan, she has to be vegan.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.880]   But a couple of them like not watching TV for 30 days.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.240]   She's like, "Yeah, you can do whatever you want, but I'm gonna watch TV."
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.400]   Well, I gotta do about 100 different things.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   So I'll pick one and we'll do it.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.520]   Something for 30 days.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   Something.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.720]   Maybe it's managing your finances.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.680]   Maybe it's keeping track of your assets.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.840]   Maybe it's planning your future.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.280]   I've got a tool that will help personalcapital.com.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.880]   The more progress you make in your...
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   It's kind of catch-22.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.560]   The more progress you make in your financial life, the more complicated it is to manage
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.200]   the more overwhelming it can be.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.560]   It's easy when you're a student and you have no money, nothing to worry about.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.160]   But then you get a job, you get a career, you've got accounts everywhere checking savings,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.920]   you've got a retirement account, I hope.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:02.280]   Credit cards, perhaps you've got investments, mortgages, of course, loans.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:09.320]   I got a plan for you that's free, that's easy, that lets you see the puzzle all at once,
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.080]   a complete overview.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.120]   Don't have incomplete intel.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.720]   This is about knowing what's going on in your financial life.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:23.360]   Charts, graphs, reports that tell the whole story, like having a financial GPS.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.760]   You can use it for personalcapital.com/twig is the address.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.160]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.000]   Signing up takes minutes, you're going to give it some account information.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.400]   It's completely secure and safe.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.520]   They store that account information in the same place that the banks do.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.120]   In fact, in most cases, the banks...
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.600]   This company already has your information.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.000]   It's really a really great way to find out what's going on.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.760]   You can get some great financial advice.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.480]   And today, personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.840]   We interviewed Bill Harris, I think that's his name, who started personal capital.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.840]   Do you know him?
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.000]   It seems like you would know him, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.160]   No, I don't.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:08.840]   He was CEO of eBay for a while, I think, or was it PayPal?
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.440]   Really interesting, fella.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:16.760]   We interviewed him on our triangulation show.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.200]   He's really up on the future of finance and so forth.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   Fascinating stuff.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   He was former CEO of PayPal and into it.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   That's it.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.000]   There you go.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.400]   One of the things we talked about, which is fascinating, is virtual currencies and the
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.960]   issues of authentication and stuff.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   Really smart guy.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:40.320]   It was a fun triangulation.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.400]   I'm pleased to say I started using personal capital when we interviewed him, which was
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   more than a year ago.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   I love it.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   It's a great product.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   All right, let's see.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:56.480]   I'm not going to download that HTML verification file till after the show.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.680]   Hangouts now have telethons.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.160]   There's a couple of just a bit of hangout news.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.960]   Yeah, let's do some hangout news.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:12.440]   There's that and then I just added to the bottom of the Google section there, Toyota
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.200]   just introduced a collaborative tool for making cars and stuff using hangouts.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.800]   It's an interesting commercial use of hangouts from Google.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.840]   Victor Dortridge announced this afternoon.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.160]   Let's start with the first one.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.440]   We'll do both.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:33.480]   The hangoutathon has to do with Giving Tuesday.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:41.640]   Hangouts on Giving Tuesday, organizations like UNICEF, Charity, Water, Save the Children,
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:49.560]   the Malala Fund, the Trevor Project, and others will be involved asking donors to help starting.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.960]   Well, I guess it's over.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   This was yesterday.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.960]   Oh, we missed it.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.280]   There's Wednesday, yes.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   Oh, damn it.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.720]   Well, it's not too late to give some money.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.280]   Do you think there'll be more of these?
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   This is kind of a neat idea.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.800]   I don't know how much they raised, but what a great idea.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.560]   And thank you, Google, for doing it.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.120]   So I didn't see it.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.800]   Do they rotate through the different groups, or how do they do it?
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.760]   I think they have different celebrities come in and each other.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.960]   Yeah, Jennifer Garner.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Oh.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   Kind of fun.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.120]   I wish they got in Jerry Lewis.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.600]   The nice thing about these, of course, you can always watch after the fact, because it's
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   on YouTube.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.240]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   You know what?
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.400]   This is the modern.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.760]   This is the modern Jerry Lewis.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.240]   If Jerry were here...
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.040]   Oh, there's the wonderful Sarah Hill.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.080]   Now, for this giving to...
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   You know her, Leo?
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   I don't.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   She is wonderful.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   She was a news anchor in some of Southern City.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   She now works for a veterans organization.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.280]   But she was the most amazing person using Hangouts on the air and Google Glass, and
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   she's just great.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.760]   Well, that's neat.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   And look at all.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:03.080]   They have a lot of people using Hangouts and talking about their stories and stuff.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   This is really neat.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.520]   And we were really moved, not just by the story, but...
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.240]   So I hope they raised the applause.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   What was the take?
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.320]   Yeah, I don't know why you look so pink, Jeff.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.840]   We got to work on you.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   I mean, for if they were so...
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.920]   This is really neat.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   She seems so strong.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.920]   It's so tall.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.920]   Nice job, Google.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.280]   Now, okay, so that's the...
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.000]   And I presume there'll be more of these.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.160]   That was yesterday's giving Tuesday with a Hangoutathon.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.440]   Now, tell me about the story that you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.440]   Well, I saw something that Google just added cars to the Knowledge Graph, and then I saw
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.360]   it kind of why they did that because they...
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.680]   Toyota has introduced the collaborator.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.160]   If you go to the last piece there, there's cars in the Knowledge Graph, which makes sense
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.680]   and there's going to be a way to help sell cars.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.120]   But now, Vic just announced this.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   And commercial.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.480]   Buying a car is a big decision.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.920]   Now with Toyota Collaborated.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.400]   So let's get started.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.960]   So this is some like salesman.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.560]   I think so.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.680]   So this reminds me of the Amazon May Day feature on the Kindle.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.200]   Except that you're not trying to fix the Kindle, you're actually trying to sell a car.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   Right.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.560]   Oh, and he's got like tools to let you pick a color.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.200]   I think there are a couple.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.760]   I don't think he's a salesman.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.760]   I think so.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   I think I think I'll see.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.160]   Oh, oh, he's... they're doing it together.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   Right.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   Mmm.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   It's smoother and it looks around.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   That's so cool.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.160]   So they're in the picker.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.160]   The test drive.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.160]   Well, I want to do that.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.160]   How?
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:35.960]   Oh, now you can do the May Day with a guy at your local store.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   Huh.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.160]   I want to do that.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.040]   I hope that it eliminates car dealers.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   It won't.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.360]   It just gives them a camera in your house.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.840]   You can hang up on them.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.120]   You can hang up on them, which is nice.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.280]   That's really nice.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.200]   Just call back when I get someone more friendly.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   Never mind.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   Thank you.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Goodbye.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.720]   So apparently they demo this at Google I/O.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   I must have missed that demo.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   They did?
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   Toyota collaborator.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.360]   Oh, I don't know what was new.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360]   Well, never mind.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   Well, it is.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.360]   I mean, I guess it's rolling out.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   Oh, I see.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.600]   Well, they've been using this platform of hangouts and, you know, helpouts and all this...
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   I love helpouts.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   I think that's a...
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.000]   How's that going, by the way?
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Is that...
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.240]   I think it's going pretty well.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.640]   And once you get that base there, you can build on top of it, have good APIs and then
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.920]   like you saw those overlays, you know, you could add all sorts of functionality on top
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.440]   of the videos, whether it's test driving a car or it's like, you know, point to where
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.280]   you hurt on the guy who...
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.200]   The muscle's on the man or something like that.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.480]   So, you know, I think there's a lot of potential there.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.760]   We'll see how that works.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.680]   But having open source video codecs and all those sorts of things, you know, are good
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.280]   for the web long term as well.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.000]   So Toyota.com/collaborator.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.840]   Too bad I'm not in the market for a Toyota, but...
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.440]   You can hang out with somebody, which would be a spouse or a friend.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.520]   And this I think is a lot of times the case when you're buying a car, at least for me,
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.640]   I don't know anything about cars.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.200]   So I would want somebody to help me.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.040]   Well, as my wife says, I'm a rotten negotiator, so she insists on doing that.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.640]   And as you can see, I launched it and immediately launches Hangouts.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.400]   So Chad, do you want to help me buy a car?
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400]   Okay.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   Let's do it.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]   Let's do it.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.560]   I think Chad's doing such good work, you should buy him a car.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   Okay, this is good.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560]   Chad, you need a car, right?
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   I'll ask for...
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.560]   I should...
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.080]   Bought Robin in numerous 80s.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.480]   I think, Leo, it's a nice thing for you to do for your staff for Christmas each.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   Everybody gets a new car, okay?
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.680]   We've been trying to figure out what to get our staff, and I think that's...
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   There you go.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   That's quite brilliant.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.240]   Make sure it's Twit Blue.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.520]   You're the first thing...
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.200]   So it's asking for...
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.400]   Here it is now.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.520]   Now I'm in the Hangout chat.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520]   Are you getting an invitation?
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.760]   Yeah, I'm signing in right now.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   And it'll say...
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.800]   I'm in three Hangouts at them.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   Oh no, no, just two.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.120]   It's just very popular.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.720]   This is cool.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   So do we...
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.280]   Apparently we have to buy a Corolla chat.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.080]   Oh, is that the only car we can customize?
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.320]   I think so.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   Okay.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.320]   I think so.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   Let's see.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   We can...
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.320]   Well, no, you can choose a trim.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.320]   The good news is it's only $60,000.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   Only.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.280]   Well, I'm not going to buy you a $40,000 car.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   Okay.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.920]   So we can rotate it.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   There you are.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   You're both in.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   So there you go.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   Chads, okay.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.840]   Let's customize it here.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.920]   And this is using Hangout.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.840]   So what they've done is they've attached...
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.240]   How hard is this...
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   What are they doing here?
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.040]   So do you know?
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.520]   I mean, is this a plug-in?
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.440]   Well, I think they've got the basic API.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   And if you think about...
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440]   Oh, look.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440]   It's looking at my eyes.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440]   When I look rough to right...
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440]   So crazy.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.480]   Oh, this is neat.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   No, Burke, you can't have a new car.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.080]   Burke's coming over.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.080]   Wow, that's kind of cool.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   That's phenomenal.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.320]   Well, I mean, okay, let's not go crazy.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   I mean, it's just...
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.720]   That was really my Charlie Rose imitation.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720]   Oh my God.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.920]   Now, how do I see the car that you...
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.360]   What do you see?
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.040]   See, over on my end...
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.120]   Well, right now I see you, but that's because I...
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120]   Well, that's no fun.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120]   I viewed you.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.840]   And if I go in here, it looks like I have a different car.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.920]   Oh, you don't have the same view.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.240]   How can I share this with you?
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   Do I have to...
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   Do you...
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   Do you...
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   Do you...
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   Do you...
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240]   Do you...
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   Do you...
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   Do you...
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   Do you...
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   Do you...
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   Do you...
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   Do you...
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.240]   Do you...
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   Why don't you see the same thing I do?
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.880]   It seems like I would.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.080]   Maybe I drag you into the car.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   That's a little...
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.640]   No, that's too intuitive.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   Huh, okay.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.880]   Might still be some UI work.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:59.080]   So this is using stuff that's already part of...
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.080]   Maybe...
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   Oh, are you in Chrome, Chad?
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080]   I'm...
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   I'm in Safari.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   No, no, you got it.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080]   No, there's your problem right there.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   What?
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080]   It's just Hangouts.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.400]   No, my friend.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.240]   It's sound nation.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   You are...
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.600]   Create music with your friends in Google Hangouts.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   Completely different.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   We could load up the...
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.960]   Let's make some music, friend.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.600]   We could roll up what I use for dating.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.040]   I didn't even know about this.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.040]   This is cool.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   Yeah, no, these...
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.760]   So, Google has a built-in sort of plugin system for Hangouts.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760]   That's what's going on.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   Right.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.480]   And so like what I do normally is there's an app called Roll20 and so I could play D&D
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   games.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480]   Oh, you're such a geek.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   With my friends.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   And so we use...
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.200]   So in the Hangout, we can roll dice, we can see a big board, we can do different things
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.160]   and we could even like rotate our characters and stuff.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.760]   And so this is using that platform of where you can...
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   Well, look what I...
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   We can do...
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   This is like a Raj band.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   You and I can make music together.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.600]   It's got samples.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   And I can...
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   And then we're...
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   I just...
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   I think this is incredible.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   I didn't realize this.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.760]   I'm not really up on what's going on.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.560]   It changes Hangouts from just a multiple video call to a place where you can actually collaborate
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   with people.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   So here's Roll20.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.160]   So we'd need to be playing a D&D game.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160]   Right.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   And so, you know...
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   Well met.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.160]   Well met.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160]   Well met, friend.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.720]   So take me to the game.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.320]   Choose a campaign to launch.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.080]   I'm going to create a new campaign.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.080]   There you go.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080]   I don't even know what the hell I'm doing here.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   And so...
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.080]   Oh look.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.920]   Once you've created a campaign, you can upload images and it'll give you a little to put it
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   in there.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   So this is in the...
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   In the chat.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   Online gaming.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   Yeah, over there in that...
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.320]   So there's now there's two chats which is a little bit confusing.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.680]   But like over in that other chat, you could write a slash Roll D20 and it would roll and
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.760]   keep a log of what you could play.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   So does it play Dungeon Master?
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   It can't...
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   Yeah, it's...
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   You haven't automated Dungeon Master?
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   No, no.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   I mean you still need a DM.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.160]   I have to draw some stuff.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.840]   Yeah, you still need a DM.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   But you...
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.320]   Here is my island.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.920]   There are no income taxes here.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.120]   No government regulation.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.620]   No island.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.600]   It's called Google Island.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.440]   There is king.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   Yes.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.120]   Now, let's roll a dice.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.960]   Here be dragons.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.600]   And so, and so, and this is, you know, your GM would use this tool to create maps.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   Right.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600]   And you can see the grid.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.000]   So now, you know that such and such item only goes 20 meters.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.640]   So you can fire that long.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   Enter the dungeon.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   Right.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.000]   But like click on over there on this...
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.040]   One of the tools is a dice roller.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.280]   Yeah, well, no, I rolled the dice.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   Okay, good.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   And so you get all sorts of stuff over there.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.680]   So that's Roll 20.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.200]   And then there's Toyota Collaborator.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   So there's only really right now three things I can do.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   I can make music.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.880]   I can play Dungeons and Dragons, or I can buy a Corolla.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   Right.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   That's...
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   Well, no, I mean, there's actually a lot.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.280]   There's a full plug-in system that people...
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.880]   Yeah, but we need other people to...
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   Right.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.560]   You could read books to your children with, you know, open things like that.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.640]   That's nice, because you don't have to see the brass.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.120]   Yeah, you can do a...
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.720]   Right.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.920]   You can do a remote desktop, you know, help-out service where you can call...
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   Well, you know, I just...
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920]   I feel like I'm out of it.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   I did not realize they were doing all this cool stuff.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   I have no idea either.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.400]   One of my favorite things is Google Effects.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.840]   Yeah, I mean, I can go in there.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.280]   You can add, you know, so if I'm looking at myself, I can add a hat to it, or devils...
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   Devil horns.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   Yeah, we've seen that.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.600]   And that was kind of like the basic thing from way back...
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.960]   Right, I remember that.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.120]   So this is more of that plug-in architecture.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   Right.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   Where do you find this?
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   This is a hangout.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.840]   I mean, once you've joined a hangout...
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.040]   Look at me, Chad.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040]   Oh, wait.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.160]   I got it.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   Very good.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   Very good.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   Leo, it's...
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.360]   You have my hair, thanks.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   You obviously approach.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.320]   I am looking like Chad.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.920]   And a dog.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.520]   Over here on the side, you have...
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.840]   This is where you find them.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.480]   So once you're in the hangout, you can click this little dot dot dot.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   Oh, they're all there.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.240]   Yeah, and you can add more apps.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   It gives you a whole bunch of...
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.440]   Oh, there's a whole lot more.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.800]   Yeah, see, the story before bedtime is fun.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.880]   You get a whole bunch of open source stories.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   Wow.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   What does YouTube do?
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   Is that to record?
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880]   Is that to...
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   No, just to...
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880]   You can view YouTube videos together.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.680]   Oh, well, that's neat.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   Talk about that.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.680]   And it syncs up.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.640]   See, look, now, see Matt, it's on Hangouts at the moment.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   Pirate Matt.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.640]   Right.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   Hipster Pirate Matt.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.720]   Tiny T. Wow, that's cool.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.720]   That is...
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   I like this.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   This is a nice feature.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.120]   I'd never seen that before.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   Just showed...
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120]   I gotta pay more...
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   I should watch that this week in Google show.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.280]   I hear they cover this stuff pretty well.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.360]   Wow.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.720]   Can you say the word pirate?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.960]   Oh, what are you doing?
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.680]   I'm sorry, I'm playing with the background.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.120]   That's okay, just keep it that way.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   It's just beautiful.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.600]   It's a little weird.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.640]   But once you have this in an open standard, then you can use WebRTC or anything else to
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   sort of...
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.720]   Doesn't have to be Hangouts, in other words, you could...
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.240]   Matt, you've lost a lot of credibility with me right now for some of this time.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.440]   And now we have Google's spam fight at Matt Cuts.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.080]   So I don't know if pirate is one of the words you can say in the Google keyboard on Android.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   But there are a lot of words you can't say.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.880]   Wired Magazine discovered...
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.960]   There's a 185,000 word dictionary.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.680]   Now, this is not banned words.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.480]   It's not that you can't use these words.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.880]   It's that it will never offer these words as a suggestion for autocomplete.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.280]   From preggers to Pizzle, Android's bizarre list of banned words, Google hasn't said
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.240]   where they get their list.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   But as you're swiping...
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.040]   And this is only for the Google keyboard on Android.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.760]   As you're swiping, you can't...
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.840]   You can't, for instance, accidentally.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.320]   And this is the main point.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.280]   You can type in lovemaking.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.520]   But if you do this lovemaking...
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.960]   I mean, close to it, it will never suggest lovemaking.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.840]   And I don't think this is unreasonable, frankly.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.600]   But is prevented geek.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.880]   I don't know why it would prevent you from coming out with geek, except that maybe it's
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.760]   an insult to some people.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:33.560]   When added trophia and rumination are a banned thud, for some reason LSAT is banned.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:42.480]   Pizzle, bralous, panty, tampax, lactation, uterus, and preggers are all banned.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   Condom is banned.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.200]   That's in other words, those will never show up unless you turn off...
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   I don't...
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   Actually, can you turn off...
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:57.320]   Those will not show up as auto-complete suggestions or correction suggestions.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:05.080]   If you turn off safe typing, I don't know if that's the way to disable this.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.880]   Nobody knows where this dictionary comes from.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.600]   Google declined according to the Wired article to comment on how it compiles a list of offensive
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:19.080]   words and how often the list is updated.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.400]   Maybe somebody will take a fresh look at that after this article.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.360]   I suspect that every time we see something like this, that's what happens.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.840]   Google goes, "Oh, we didn't know that.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   Let's fix that."
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.320]   It's easy to do.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   Easy to do.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.120]   I think though it makes some sense.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120]   You don't...
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.320]   This is the damn you auto-correct problem.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.880]   You don't want the auto-correct to fill in words that some people might find offensive.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.800]   It doesn't mean you can't type those words in.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:54.960]   You just don't want them to suddenly appear by accident.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.960]   What else should we do here?
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.120]   I'm just looking through our stories.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.160]   Demand media has fallen.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.960]   Oh, I read that.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.480]   And guess who helped trip them?
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.480]   Probably you.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   I got over there.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.480]   And that cuts.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.920]   So demand media always bugged me and I think it's bugged you to Jeff Jarvis, anybody who
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.800]   likes the idea of real handmade journalism.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:26.240]   The idea of demand media was that if you look at all the search terms that are popular
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.640]   and create articles based on those search terms, you can do quite well with...
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.360]   They're not that they're not generated by humans, but they're synthetic articles.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.840]   That's not an evil strategy off the back because about.com made its business around
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   that.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840]   I'm saying people are asking questions.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   Let's have answers for those questions.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.000]   So that part was okay.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.200]   Demand media turned that into the first of the major content farms where indentured servants
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.600]   of writers doing things for $2 or $10 would turn out these articles over and over and
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.400]   over again with nothing new, no quality.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.080]   And so I think the matter was you who talked about how as a result, Google had to look
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.320]   for more signals of what, authority, originality.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:14.360]   What were those signals that you had to add in to try to decrease the content farms from
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   rising up?
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.680]   Yeah, there were a lot of them.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.680]   We had to do a lot of research, but the litmus test was always what is the value add for
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   users?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.720]   If something is the sort of site that somebody really wants to tell people about or bookmark
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.960]   or those kinds of things, then that tends to be a really high quality site.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.960]   Whereas if you land on at once and you're like, "Oh, this is awful.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.960]   What am I doing here?"
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.880]   Then it's clearly not the sort of site that we want to return to the search engine.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.160]   And so the challenge is trying to find the signals that are able to ascertain the quality
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.640]   of a site and the added value to a site for users.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.720]   And I feel like we've done a pretty good job with Bandit.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.720]   We always keep iterating.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.600]   We typically have updates every month or so.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.280]   But yeah, that was an interesting article to read because I don't think these days if
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:06.200]   you say, "I'm going to just create a lot of very low price content on the web."
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.440]   People would automatically be like, "Okay, that sounds like a great business model."
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440]   Right.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.520]   Well, I mean, and this is demand media with a capital DNN.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.520]   This is a business called demand media doing something we label demand media.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.960]   Their biggest website, eHow, actually has some good stuff on it.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.800]   I've used eHow to find out how to do stuff.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.360]   No, I mean, demand media is not completely terrible.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.560]   But this is why Matt's job is tough.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.560]   It's because it's not obvious, right?
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   There's definitely some content that you do when we turn and some that you don't.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.480]   And typically on a per domain basis, you can say, "Oh, your times, probably higher quality
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.200]   content, whereas some other domain might not be."
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.280]   But you can find high quality content on a domain that might not have the best stuff
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.320]   otherwise and vice versa.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.840]   And the idea would be that you would create link baity articles that would then have ads
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.560]   on those pages and that because these articles are generated based on popular search terms,
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560]   they'd be very successful.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.680]   There'd be a lot of money to be made.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.040]   But you kind of, with your spam fighting and attempting to find better signals and
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.880]   better more authoritative articles kind of, I think, hurt the company, went public in
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:26.880]   2011, market cap went to as much as $2 billion, making it more valuable, at least for the
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.520]   time being than the New York Times.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.960]   Demand media is now about a quarter of that value and the co-founder is no longer CEO
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.960]   as of October.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.520]   They're looking for a replacement.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.200]   In fact, it looks like the only thing left of their business is their domain registration
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   business.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   Which was where it all started.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   Oh, interesting.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.200]   Right.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.760]   They had a whole bunch of domains, typo domains.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760]   That kind of stuff.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.880]   They throw some content on there and get ads on that, right, Matt?
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   That's where this...
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.160]   Yeah, Enom was always sort of a source of strength for demand media.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:05.720]   The interesting thing is that there was another domain registrar or registry which had mentioned
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720]   that...
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.320]   Well, people don't necessarily like seeing what we call parked domains showing up in search
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   results.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320]   So, you know, if you just type in...
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.480]   A lot of people actually type in the address bar.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:23.240]   So, we actually deployed an algorithm that tries to not show parked domains with all those
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.080]   ads in search results.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.440]   And so, we saw at least one company say, as a result, domain parking is...
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.200]   You know, it started to grow more slowly or even decline a little bit because, you know,
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.920]   that algorithm did have an impact on that.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:44.240]   So, as an example, and this is a variety article, they created 3D-bluerayplayers.com.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.960]   And of course, the idea would be that if I did a Google search for 3D-bluerayplayers,
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.720]   well, what would be more canonical than a site called 3Dbluerayplayers.com?
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.240]   But of course, you go there and it's just a parked page with a lot of ads on it.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.400]   And I remember there was a period where I would get a lot of those in Google searches.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.200]   And it's gone and it's gone and it's not because the pages are gone.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.600]   It's because you fixed it.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.520]   We worked really hard to try to make sure that just if you just come up with a clever
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:15.480]   name, you know, something something.net, you know, that doesn't automatically mean you
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.680]   should rank for that particular search.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   So...
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   This is in the variety article.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.480]   Early on, demand used Enom.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.320]   That was their registrar service, ENOM.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.200]   Used Enom's 1 million generic domain names to serve up relevant ads to people searching
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   for specific topics.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:35.560]   These domain parking pages were immensely profitable, generating north of $100,000 a
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.680]   day according to a former demand exec who requested anonymity.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:46.240]   That's $35 to $40 million a year without doing any work, the exec said.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.040]   But as Variety pointed out, the tactic was fundamentally a bait and switch.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.320]   You thought you'd get some information and said you just got some ads.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320]   And we've all seen that.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.320]   I mean, I don't think that...
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:02.880]   Matt, I've been arguing for some time that search becomes more and more and more personalized.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.000]   That SEO, especially as a dark art, starts to decline in importance because you can't
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.040]   demonstrate ARR-Y.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.440]   You can't say, "Well, we raised you four spots for everybody's search results because you
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   don't know."
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440]   Would you agree with that?
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.320]   Well, there's two parts to that.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.880]   I'd say there's the kind of SEO that is just making your site a better site, better architecture,
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.400]   cleaner URLs, not duplicate content, that sort of stuff.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.560]   And that's always a good idea.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.640]   That's just like making sure your resume doesn't have any typos on it.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.960]   That's just clever stuff.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.320]   And then there's the kind of SEO that is sort of cheating, trying to get a lot of bad backlinks
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.800]   or scamming.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.880]   And that's more like lying on your resume.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.600]   When you sometimes get caught, then there's repercussions.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.560]   And it definitely helps to personalize because instead of just trying to rank number one
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.280]   for plumbers, now anywhere you search for plumbers, there's local results and there's
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.280]   results that are not just the same across the entire country or the entire world.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:03.520]   But it's also the case that we've done a very diligent job of trying to crack down
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.160]   on the black hat type of spam.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.800]   So we had an algorithm called Pinkwyn that launched that really kind of had a pretty
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.000]   big impact.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.640]   We had a more recent launch just a few months ago.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   And if you go and you patrol the black hat SEO forums where the guys talk about the techniques
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.720]   that work, there, you know, now it's more people trying to sell other people scams rather
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.360]   than just trading tips.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.800]   There's a lot of the life has gone out of those forums and even the smaller networks
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.680]   that they're trying to promote, "Oh, you know, buy my Anglo rank," or whatever, we're
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.680]   in the process of tackling a lot of those link networks as well.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.480]   So the good part is if you want to do a real site, you don't have to worry as much about
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.080]   these bad guys jumping ahead of you.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.680]   The playing ground is a lot more level now.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.200]   So that happened with Panda, right?
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:57.160]   Panda was for content farms and low quality and Pinkwyn was for spam, actual cheating.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160]   And now you've got Hummingbird.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   We do, yeah.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.400]   Hummingbird is a rewrite of the core surge algorithm.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.240]   Just to do a better job of matching the user's query with documents, especially for natural
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.040]   language queries, you know, the queries get longer.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.480]   They have more words in them.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.880]   And sometimes those words matter and sometimes they don't.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:20.040]   And so Hummingbird affects 90% of all searches, but usually just to a small degree because
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:25.160]   we're saying, "Okay, this particular document isn't really about what the user searched
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.720]   for because maybe they said, "Okay, Google now, how do I put a rootabaga up into space?"
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.360]   And what really matters is rootabaga in space and not how do I or something.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.560]   Right.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.640]   So these can be, it's not that Panda was replaced by rootabaga, whatever the new one is.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   Pinkwyn, no.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.440]   Pinkwyn, they are in parallel.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.400]   Yeah, they all complement each other.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.400]   Okay.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.200]   What is the current one, the latest?
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.760]   Is that?
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.440]   We've been working on a lot of different stuff.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.280]   You know, we've actually now been trying to work on how to promote good guys.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.720]   So if you're an authority in a space, you know, if you search for podcasts, you know, you
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.680]   want to return something like Twit TV.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.000]   So we're trying to figure out who are the authorities in the individual little topic
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.320]   areas and then how do we make sure that those sites show up for medical or shopping or travel
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.880]   or anyone of thousands of other kinds.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.640]   And that's done algorithmically?
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   Not by humans.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   No, definitely not.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.640]   And scale.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   We don't like humans.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.640]   We don't need humans.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.800]   We can do it with a Python script.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   Why do it with a human?
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.280]   Humans are great, but you know, if you can find a way to tackle it with a computer program,
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.640]   that's also really nice.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.920]   And of course, your secret sauce is the signals you use to find out who has authority.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.440]   That's traditionally very difficult.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.240]   As somebody, somebody once said, I might have authority when it comes to my kids, I might
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.040]   have an authority, but it is going to have authority with you.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.040]   Right.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.040]   Right.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.760]   So authority is a very, is it kind of?
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:58.000]   Well, what's even harder is, what's right me, is authority by domain and understanding
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   the domain.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   Right.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.120]   And defining domains, defining what is medicine and what is sports.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.760]   But you can do that all algorithmically.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.080]   Yeah, actually.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.560]   So PageRank is sort of this global importance of like, the Nert Times is important.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.200]   And so if they link to you, you must also be important.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.840]   But you can start to drill down into individual topic areas and say, okay, if Jeff Jarvis
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.360]   links to me, he's an expert in journalism.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.280]   And so therefore, I might be a little bit more relevant in the journalist.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280]   Ah, that makes sense.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.840]   Trying to measure those kinds of topics.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.920]   Because you really want to listen to the experts in each area, if you can.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:37.200]   So it's really fascinating what you do.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.360]   What was your training to do this, Matt?
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   I was a computer graphics guy.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   No.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.360]   None, in other words.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   None.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.560]   And did you learn on the job or?
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:52.560]   Well, I learned because I wrote Safe Search and Safe Search was this porn filter.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.720]   And I saw all these bad, horrible things happening.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.480]   And so I sort of like pulled up the rock and saw the dark things crawling underneath.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.200]   And so as a result, I've kind of ended up working in that area.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.280]   It wasn't like I was trying to learn all the different 19 different ways to say sex or
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.280]   anything like that.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:16.120]   Do you think at this point you really understand the secret sauce and PageRank and all of that?
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.560]   You know, Google does a good job of breaking things down into different areas.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.160]   So Amit Singal is the head of all of search ranking.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.680]   And he's really got everything in his mind.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.360]   And he's got a whole core of lieutenants who understand individual parts like synonyms
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.520]   and spelling.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.160]   And our team's job is really the quality of individual sites and whether people are
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.520]   spamming or cheating.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.720]   So that part of it is really my core.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.520]   And that's what I hopefully know back.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.560]   But it seems that to make that work, things like authority and all that stuff, you have
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.000]   to understand all of those, how all those signals apply, where they come from, what to do with
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.640]   them, how to wait them.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.160]   So it seems like to be effective at what you do.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.720]   You have to really do have to fundamentally understand what's going on.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.720]   It really helps.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.960]   And one of the secrets that we do is people don't have individual offices as much at
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   Google.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:10.160]   So I'm in the same office with Amit Singal and a lot of the ranking leads and the web's
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.720]   family leads are often in the same office.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.880]   So when somebody's talking about, oh, we don't return banana republic for this search,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.320]   you know, somebody else can be in the same room and perk up their ears and sort of figure
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.680]   out what's going on.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.920]   So co-locating all the leads has been very helpful.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.920]   It's really interesting.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.880]   You've heard me joke often, or not joke.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.280]   What I'm not saying is very serious is that I would think that you'd be the meanest,
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.520]   nastiest, most cynical, horrible person at Google and you're the nicest person I know
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.120]   there.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.320]   But the serious question from that, that's a very sincere compliment and very true.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.560]   So it's your question from that is, in your job, have you gotten a better sense of psychology,
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.600]   either that of the worlds or of your own?
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.560]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.120]   Because if you want to stop spam, the most straightforward way to do it is to deny people
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.520]   money because they care about the money and that should be their end goal.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.400]   But if you really want to stop spam and it's a little bit mean, but what you want to do
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.080]   is you want to break their spirit.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   You want to make them.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Yes.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.080]   Wow.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   Break their spirit.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   Wow.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.320]   So there are parts of Google's algorithms specifically designed to frustrate spammers
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   and make them frustrated.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   Oh, man.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.680]   And some of the stuff we do gives people a hint that their site is going to drop and then
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.280]   a week or two later, their site actually does drop so they get a little bit more frustrated.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.800]   And so hopefully, and we've actually seen this happen, people step away from the dark
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.480]   side and they're like, you know what, that was so much pain and anguish and frustration.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.680]   Let's just stay on the high road from now on.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.320]   And they don't know it was Matt Cuts that did it.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.880]   Well, it's the team, right?
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.840]   I can't, I can't, I have a fan.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840]   I love this.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.120]   I see you petting a white cat.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.680]   We should frustrate you then.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.720]   We should frustrate you.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.080]   And then they shall bring me masking tape.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.480]   Well, one of some of the stuff that I like the best is when people say, you know what,
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.400]   this SEO stuff is too unpredictable.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.720]   I'm just going to write some apps.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.000]   I'm going to go off and do something productive for society.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   And that's great.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   All that energy is channeled.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.800]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.480]   You say stitching content is bad quality content.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.600]   Yeah, that was just a webmaster video that we made that, you know, it's kind of funny
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.920]   we get these requests that come in from all over the world and somebody says, can I do
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.880]   guest blog posting, you know, and on one end of the spectrum, you know, if Jeff Jarvis
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.080]   wants to do a guest blog website, you should do it.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:42.040]   But typically what we see is, you know, people who are really like the right in article one
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:48.600]   time and then email a thousand people and say, hey, how can we get some free links from
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600]   you?
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.600]   Right.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.040]   And so we, you know, you have to answer those kinds of questions bearing in mind both ends
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.040]   of those spectrum.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.640]   So I'm going to mark them as spam.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.040]   Is that the right thing to do?
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.240]   Yeah, that definitely is the right thing to do.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.640]   If you want to ford them onto me, Jeff, because we love to get those.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.440]   Yeah, we love to get those spam reports.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.840]   There was a, there was a fun Gawker story that just came out last night that was about,
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840]   um, sorry.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:18.240]   Do you want to get that?
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.760]   No, no, no, I got it.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.320]   Hello, Mr. Cuts.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.840]   I'm a spammer and I have a message for you.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.760]   They're doing a denial of services.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.160]   Your phone will not work again.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.640]   That's, uh, no, but it is sort of interesting.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:41.480]   There was a guy who sort of pulled back the veil of secrecy on buying and selling links,
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.800]   which is not only against Google's guidelines, but against FTC guidelines as well.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.480]   And then two years later, somebody reached out and said, Hey, can I buy some links from
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   you?
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.600]   So this guy led him on for a while and he was like, can you send me some examples of
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.200]   the work that you've done in the past?
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.960]   And then he, you know, bundles it all up and writes it in a golf article, but a lot of
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.560]   SEOs will actually lead people on and say, well, send me examples of your portfolio.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.160]   And then they'll just forward that on as a spam report to Google.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160]   So, wow.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.360]   So, so Matt, what, what, what was it?
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.600]   We turn a triangulation all of a sudden, um, you and native advertising, a whole, there
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.160]   was a big FTC event today about native advertising.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.160]   I'm going to do some survey.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.440]   I'm going to do some work on trying to find how confused readers really are.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.720]   Tony Hill at Chartbeat has been telling you that the click through on this stuff isn't
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.720]   that good.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.640]   Of course, it's taking over the world.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.640]   Most people for all.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.360]   Um, how do you deal with, with an advertisement data advertising is when you're trying to
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.160]   make what is basically an advertiser's content, like content so that they're, uh, friendly
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160]   with that.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.400]   How, how do you view it advertising?
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.800]   It's, uh, it's really tricky because my scope of expertise is the search engines.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.560]   And so if you're not spamming the search engines, I, or Google specifically, I might not like
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.560]   it.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560]   I think that you're a horrible person, but we, we wouldn't take action on you on within
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.440]   Google necessarily.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.600]   And so, um, with native advertising, our litmus test is, you know, do you have links that
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600]   are not adequately disclosed?
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.200]   Users, readers can't realize that they're paid for and more importantly, search engines,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.800]   you know, they affect search engines.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.920]   So if, if your paid links don't affect search engines, then you're not violating Google's
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920]   quality guidelines.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:26.840]   But I think you need to, in my opinion, my personal opinion, you need to have clear and
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.800]   conspicuous, you know, disclosure because if someone doesn't realize that it's an ad,
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.840]   then you know, you're, you're down a really bad, slippery slope.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.080]   Jeff, you're not asking him the important questions.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.360]   What the hell is the barge all about?
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.200]   This is what we want to know.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.480]   This is what we want to know.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   Your guess is as good as mine.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   You don't know.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   They haven't told you.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:51.120]   Well, you know, that we've, we've read a little bit internally, but I'll, I'll stick
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   with them.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:57.280]   I got an invitation to the Google Christmas party that actually had a link to the, to the
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.000]   barge article.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.160]   So should I go to that?
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.800]   This is the San Francisco Christmas party.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:08.720]   Should I go to that party and expect to be taken over to the barge and floated away?
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.760]   Maybe they'll have little tiny barges that they hand out to people or something like
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   that.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.480]   You know, I've never been invited to the New York Christmas party.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   No, they think about it.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.640]   Hey, that's not nice.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   Geez.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.640]   It's the hacks.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.960]   This is the one I was invited to.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.440]   The hacks and flax holiday party.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.440]   The air is brisk.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.240]   The days are short and Google's getting ready to help Santa deliver presents with a very
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.160]   large floating nautical sled.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.920]   This isn't the invitation.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920]   So I don't know.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.560]   I should probably go.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.360]   But it's a, it's a good.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.280]   It's at the glass base camp on Spear Street.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:53.320]   So I'm thinking there's no way to get me from Spear Street to the waterfront in any prompt
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.280]   amount of time.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:01.800]   If they said the party would be on the barge, I'd be there in a second in a heartbeat.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.160]   We don't we don't know what the barge is, but the San Francisco Chronicle on Monday
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.800]   ran a story from their investigative reporters.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:16.800]   So material Ross that says, according to the budget report from the builder, it's one
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.320]   of the first of three floating wonders.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.680]   The company plans to launch at a total cost of $35 million.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.600]   Turner construction company says the idea is to construct the vessels at Treasure Island
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.720]   then dock them in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.840]   It's the projects called Hanger three.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.640]   Each barges to be stacked with 80 shipping containers and flanked by rows of sales.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.000]   It's a floating retail store.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.160]   You might, you guys at Google must laugh when you see these stories.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.720]   It's it's fun to see how people try to reverse engineer what's going on.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.680]   The guy who had a floating car and happened to just be located near Google and he's like,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.200]   I am not affiliated.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.760]   This is not this is not my floating car.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.160]   That's not my floating car.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   All right.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:08.120]   I think anything else you guys want to talk about before we move on to our picks and number
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   of the week here.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.080]   Got it, boss.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:18.760]   We move glass used by surgeons comedian wears glass to the mall.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.960]   Last I didn't watch the but the but the stick was that he wanted to convince people that
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.560]   when he was talking to his class that he was actually talking to them and confusing them.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:34.800]   Like talking over their shoulder, but he thinks he's talking to them.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.200]   Ed Bassmaster, not his real name.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.400]   I'm thinking I would doubt it.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.080]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.920]   I don't know.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   All right.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.920]   Let's let's take a break and we'll come back and we will have your Leo's tool, Jeff's number
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.360]   and Matt's thing coming up just to my our show today.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:59.120]   Oh, I didn't bring my iPad out here to show you Hulu plus.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.480]   I am using Hulu everywhere now.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.960]   Hulu plus is fabulous.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:09.800]   It's a way you can really binge on TV shows and movies and clips and stuff anywhere.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.640]   You can do TV, your PC, your smartphone, your tablet.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.960]   Hulu, here comes my tablet.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.320]   Would you mind getting me my my smartphone as well?
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.160]   My Android as long as we're as long as we're talking here.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.720]   I am just a big fan of Hulu plus.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.640]   Let me fire it up here on my iPad air.
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.920]   You know, I was watching.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:34.360]   There's a lot of kids stuff on here and I was watching Sesame Street's parody of Mad Men.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.640]   What's quite fun?
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.080]   Hulu plus is for $7.99 a month, a great deal.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.240]   You can watch your favorite TV shows.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.920]   I watch late night, late night shows on here because I just never can stay up late enough
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.800]   to watch Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.440]   Shark tanks on your family guy.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.720]   Love that whenever I'm down, I watch family guy and I perk up Saturday Night Live.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:00.680]   Every episode of shows like Lost or Doctor Who, Community, Star Trek.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.000]   Yeah, even the original Star Trek.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.440]   They've also got Hulu originals now.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.880]   They're the wrong man's and I this is one I really enjoyed behind the mask, which is
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:16.000]   Hulu's new docu series that takes you inside the world of sports mascots.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.320]   What?
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.040]   The Mindy Project.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.360]   Love it.

[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.720]   Speaking of the holidays, they'll support you have one giant Christmas tree.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.040]   You saw the pictures on Google plus.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.520]   Twelve and a half footer.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.520]   Wow.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.600]   Well, I've always wanted a giant Christmas tree and I never really had enough room.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.840]   In fact, for years, my kids remember this.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.880]   I would buy trees that were too big for the house and have to cut off the top.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.680]   Sometimes a lot of the top.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.240]   So this year, I have it on my screen chat.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.600]   This year, there it is.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.400]   It's a big, you know, the strange thing is there's Lisa in front of the tree.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.000]   That actually doesn't make it look as big as it really is.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.360]   It's 12 and a half feet.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.320]   Did you see that Uber is delivering Christmas trees?
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.320]   What?
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320]   That's awesome.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.520]   Like 135 bucks, you press a couple buttons and they will deliver the tree to you.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.760]   Oh, that is great.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.760]   It's kind of funny.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.240]   I have this vision now of Matt never leaving home his next 30 days.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.240]   I got it.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240]   I got it.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   His next 30 day challenge is not to leave home.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240]   I want the tree drone.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.600]   When do we get the tree drone?
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.800]   Just dropping on the house.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.640]   There is was a little bit of an issue because two guys came to deliver the tree and only
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.000]   one guy left.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.120]   And I'm thinking that there is a guy somewhere stuck in the tree.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.800]   I don't know.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:36.080]   I guess I'll just keep listening for a rise of help.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.960]   Some things, some traditions, you know.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.840]   My tool is something that's been out for iPhone for a while.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:48.840]   And you know, we were talking before the show about how much I love the Moto X, but the thing
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.800]   that's almost a deal breaker is the camera is not great on the Moto X.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.920]   And I've used VSCO cam on iPhone.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.000]   It is now out for from visual supply company, VSCO.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.880]   It's now out and free for Android.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.840]   And it's quite a nice camera.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:12.120]   Now it's not going to overcome any hardware defects, but I think the features on it are
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.920]   just fabulous.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.480]   You get free presets, but you can buy, you can buy more presets.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:24.200]   I think right now you can buy, let me just take a picture and show you, you can buy presets
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.520]   the entire set, I think for six bucks.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.680]   And the things you could do with these, this is a, now admittedly Google offers snap seed
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.280]   for free.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.040]   Then one negative on the presets is they don't have names.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.160]   They just have numbers.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   So you kind of have to learn what the presets do, but they're quite, quite sophisticated.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.880]   And you can also say how strong you want any preset to be, which I really like the ability
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.720]   to have a slider that determines how strong that preset is.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:03.600]   You also have a variety of useful tools, including color temperature, contrast, brightness,
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.120]   rotation, cropping, all the things you'd expect.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.080]   And one, the other reason I kind of like it, and it's kind of not really a good reason
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:18.640]   to like something, but the pictures get saved into a local gallery.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.880]   And then if you want to upload it to, you know, because I don't like it, I mean, I love
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.520]   the Google+ auto upload.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:28.680]   But what I'd like to sometimes do is have it in a local gallery, work with it a little
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.960]   bit, and then save it, and you can do that and have it uploaded to Google+.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.600]   So it adds, this could be a negative or a positive adds another step.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.000]   But I think this is, I seem to be getting really nice pictures with this.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.240]   I also get a lot of information, including the F-stop, the ISO, and the location of the
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.120]   photo, which I think is pretty cool as well in a nice display.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.080]   This is free to try, and then if you want to get additional filters, it comes with quite
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.360]   a few 599s, VSCO Camels for Android.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:09.240]   And while it didn't turn my Moto X camera into the best camera ever, it does seem to
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.560]   improve the quality a little bit.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.380]   I'm kind of a fan recommended, and I've used it on the iPhone.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:17.720]   It's really quite nice on the iPhone.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.040]   So also the great UI, I think.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.280]   If you don't like your camera, try it.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.920]   Jeff Jarvis has, right here, four numbers of the...
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920]   Well, I always get prepared for theft.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.440]   I had a number of theft.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.440]   There was no number theft.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.400]   If you want to deliver all four, please do.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.400]   There was.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.400]   There wasn't.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:40.960]   No, no, no, no, I'll just do one, I think, which is that Google, when it... in 2003, the
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.960]   entire year was awarded four patents.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:47.240]   When the iPhone came out, it had a total of 38 patents.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:52.840]   Now it is being awarded a patents at a rate of 10 every day the patent office is open.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840]   The war is on.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.840]   That cuts.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:56.840]   That cuts.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.840]   Do you have any patents?
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.840]   I do have a few patents, actually.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.840]   And spam fighting?
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.840]   Yep.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.840]   Yep.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.840]   That's like cool.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.760]   The age of domains and time as a factor in ranking, that sort of thing.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.760]   You got to go around and sue us afterwards.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.440]   That actually brings me to my thing, in fact.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:23.520]   That's a great segue, which is a cool website called trollingaffx.org.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.120]   And this is not just your standard, "Hey, please call your congressperson."
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.520]   But if you click on the "Take Action" button, it's actually kind of neat.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.320]   It uses Twilio.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.320]   There's an API, so you call just one phone number.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.120]   You don't have to even know who your congressperson is.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.760]   So let me step back for a second.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:45.000]   The Innovation Act is an act that tries to make it harder for patent trolls to sue companies
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.280]   that are actually trying to do business.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.400]   So little tiny startups all the way up to Google.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.600]   I've certainly had to take time out of my day to deal with frivolous lawsuits from patent
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.760]   trolls and that sort of thing.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.880]   So if you dislike patent trolls, I timed it.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.200]   It only takes two minutes.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.960]   What you do is you call this phone number and it asks you, "What is your zip code?"
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:08.920]   And you just type in your zip code and it will automatically connect you to your congressperson's
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.920]   office.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.040]   So in my case, I called, I entered my zip code and it took me to Anna Eshoo.
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.240]   And there's a person right there and she says, "How can I help?"
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.080]   And I said, "I just want to say that I support the Innovation Act and it would be great if
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.120]   we could take down patent trolls and make it harder for them to take money off of hard
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.760]   working real companies."
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   And that's it.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.200]   Two minutes and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.480]   You just dial this phone number.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.320]   You'll ask you for your zip code and boom, you're done in a minute and a half.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.840]   That is awesome.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.480]   It's a good use of the Twilio API.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.320]   HR 3309, the Innovation Act of 2013.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.880]   They're going to vote on it this week.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:51.200]   It is one of several anti-patent troll initiatives, some from the executives, some from congress
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.920]   and I think we really need to do this.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:01.200]   It is a huge cost in innovation and it affects some of your favorite people.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.200]   So, I didn't say that.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.480]   So please do what you can to fight patent trolls.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:15.680]   Among other things, the Innovation Act makes it easier to fight against trolls in court
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.200]   to defend yourself.
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:26.920]   It also has a feature that requires trolls to make their cases public with specifics,
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.320]   which at least exposes them to the light of day.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.000]   And when you see what some of these people claim, it's kind of stunning and it gives
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.720]   you some protection against a particularly evil kind of patent trolling where they go
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   to end users.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.840]   Here was a company that claimed to have a patent for photocopying and they were actually going
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:53.120]   to people who have photocopiers and saying you owe us money because you use a photocopier.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.040]   And this would prohibit that.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.520]   So yeah, I think this is a good one.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.280]   Please, trollingaffects.org.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.360]   And I presume they're going to do other stuff.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.600]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.520]   They've got a good system here.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.520]   That's a great platform.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:09.840]   It's EFF, an engine, and Berkeley Law, and a bunch of great folks.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:10.840]   Public knowledge.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:11.840]   Yeah, this is good.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.520]   You feel strongly about patent trolls and you probably should.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.080]   It's literally two minutes to give them a call.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.320]   You don't even have to do any work.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.880]   It's a tough one.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.040]   It's a tough one, but I hope we can prevail.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.920]   It was not as yourography.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.320]   It was scanning documents.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.880]   If you had a scanner, they would go after small businesses who used--
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:39.560]   I'd sit them down and say, oh, if you're so smart about a scanner, do you fix mine?
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560]   They don't really--
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.480]   They're really important.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.920]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   Pretty amazing.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.200]   Matt Cutts, always a pleasure.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.960]   Thank you so much for joining us from the horse's mouth.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.400]   It was a ton of fun.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.400]   Thank you.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400]   Always a pleasure.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.400]   Great to have you here, Matt.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.400]   Good luck with stretching.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.600]   It's a wonderful thing.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.920]   Yeah, I'm stretching right now.
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.760]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.600]   Of course, the webmaster videos you do are fabulous and everybody who has a website should
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:08.600]   watch them.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.880]   Yeah, that's the only other thing I'd say is if you do a search for webmaster videos,
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.880]   we have a channel on YouTube and we're just about to hit 15 million views.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.240]   That's pretty nice.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.480]   Any questions you have if you enjoyed the Panda or the Penguin or the Hummingbird discussion,
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:29.400]   we talk about all kinds of things from mobile phones to how to make your site faster.
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:37.280]   You have 1,138,148 views according to YouTube, the Google Webmasters channel.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.160]   Why are you giving my Google Wallet card to me?
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.160]   Did I leave it lying around?
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.160]   This is--
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.160]   Never mind.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.160]   I had this Google Wallet card.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.160]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.160]   You're welcome.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   I really appreciate that.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160]   Those are very nice of you.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160]   This is my holiday gift.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.800]   I'll use it for the card.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.440]   Jeff Jarvis is Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:05.120]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com and you can catch his publications including Public Parts on
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.120]   Amazon, Gutenberg the Geek.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.960]   "The word of the geek is out on audible read by me and in German and in German and in
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.260]   Italian."
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.760]   And you read it in all those languages.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.760]   You are a--
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:16.760]   No languages.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.520]   You're a very talented guy.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.160]   Gutenberg the Geek now on audible read.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.360]   Let's listen to a little bit of Jeff Jarvis reading.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.880]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.440]   He says, "Oh, no, no."
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.840]   It's whisper sync for voice reading.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.520]   And there was this cash flow and equity structure that did him in.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:39.040]   After pivoting from one business to another, solving myriad technology problems with keen
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:44.520]   insight, recruiting a team, raising capital, perfecting his product through secret alphas
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.520]   and public betas.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520]   This is good.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.160]   I can't wait to hear this.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   39 minutes, 99 cents.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   That's a good deal.
