[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.080]   and your contributions.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.240]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.920]   Thanks so much.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.840]   This is Twig, this week in Google
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.440]   and on the line with us right now, of course.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   The wonderful Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.960]   Hi, Gina.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.600]   Afternoon.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.200]   Hello.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.320]   Founder of Life Hacker and a great person
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   to talk about Google with, I got to say.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.400]   Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, journalist extraordinaire
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.840]   and observer of all things Web 2.0 at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.640]   And our guest today, this is becoming a habit now.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.760]   What we do is we talk about somebody's blog
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   and then we bring them on the next day.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   Last week, we were talking about Kevin Marks
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.720]   and his blog post about why Twitter works.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.600]   He's joined us today.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.040]   It's great to have him.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.520]   Hi there.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640]   One of the guys behind QuickTime at Apple.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.400]   He was a chief engineer at Technorati.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   Most recently at Google, working on OpenSocial
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.960]   and the Google Profiles, currently vice president
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.720]   of web services at British Telecom, his latest brand
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   new position.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.960]   How's that going, Kevin?
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.840]   What are you doing over there?
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.320]   I'm still getting settling into it.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   But what I'm working on is connecting the world of Telefanica,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.400]   the world of the web, in all the ways that fits together.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.120]   But also, you should be aware that BT isn't--
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.200]   even despite the name, isn't really just a phone company.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.480]   It's an internet company and has been for years.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.680]   It runs the internet infrastructure for the UK
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.600]   and does lots of internet services for business in the US.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.840]   So it's been quite amusing for me because over here,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   how are they going once heard of it?
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.360]   Whereas everyone in England, it's
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.560]   been the phone company forever.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.960]   So I've got this sort of interesting cultural clash,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.520]   as I talk to people depending on whether they're British or not.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.480]   The interesting thing for me is working out
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.680]   how these things fit together.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.880]   And that was the stuff I was talking about before about the flow
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   past web, the web of flow and the web of history.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   I think that's particularly interesting
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.520]   when you come to Telefany, because we were talking about latency
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.000]   just now in your audio chain.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.960]   Latency is really, really important when
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.600]   you've got a two-way conversation going on.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.440]   You really care about being able to talk back and forth
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.960]   and interrupt each other and nod and things.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.760]   And that's something you really need for a phone.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   So that is the true real time.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.400]   Whereas the stuff we're doing with text,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.800]   there's much more slack on that.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.880]   And I was joking about you being a musician.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.320]   Musicians really, really care about this,
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.040]   because they can hear edges people can't.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.520]   There are people who really, really care about their gamers
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   because they are operating close to the edge.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.960]   And they've got very fast reflexes.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.680]   The people who noticed the web and really care about real time,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.040]   musicians trying to play with each other and gamers.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.200]   They're on the tight end.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.120]   And then the stuff that we're calling real time now,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.760]   which takes a few seconds to propagate and is textual,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.520]   that's from hardcore engineering point of view,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   that's not real time at all.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's highly late.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.880]   But the interesting thing is the latency
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   of all these things is changing.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   So the stuff that used to have to be real time,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   television had to be real time because we didn't have enough
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000]   space to buffer any of it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.400]   And so every television in the country in the UK, at least,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.640]   was synchronized to one clock at the BBC
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.280]   that was driving the flyback scan of every television.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.120]   And audio, you couldn't buffer at all.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.720]   I asked you about latency in your mixer.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.040]   That isn't a question you could have asked in the analog era.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   The latency was how long was your cable?
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.280]   So the stuff that used to have low latency
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.800]   because there wasn't any alternative
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   is now really easy to slow down.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   And we have Tivo's, we have iPods of all these things
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.000]   that means we don't have to all watch the same program
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.520]   at the same time.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.160]   Whereas the other stuff that we were assumed
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.880]   would take a little while to propagate, sending emails
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.800]   back and forth sending messages, that stuff
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.960]   is coming closer and closer and closer to the real time
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.000]   two-way interaction that we expect.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.600]   So I think there's a lot of interesting stuff
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.720]   as we move things back and forth across the boundary of stuff
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.080]   that you really need to be real time because you have a two-way
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.920]   interaction, you have this flow going,
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.040]   and stuff that you can watch later and catch up with later
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.960]   and move back and forth.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.440]   So that was my flow pass thing I said before,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.560]   and that plays into the Twitter stuff as well.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   One of the things I've seen with Twitter is that you've got
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.640]   this stuff bouncing back and forth and things put up and flow.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.920]   And you can throw something into that,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   and it'll spread and lots of people will come to that.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.960]   So you mentioned my piece last week
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.160]   that Mab is very pleased with the nice things you said about it.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.880]   And I wrote that on Friday afternoon,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.720]   and it lasted until the middle of the week
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.000]   where people were still talking about it.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.960]   But I've made us some throwaway remark on Wednesday
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.720]   about an old post of mine about identity theft,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.760]   and linked to a post of mine.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   And that had more traffic than the Twitter post,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.760]   even though I wrote that 18 months ago,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   because I'd happened to throw it into a live conversation
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   on Twitter.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720]   So having a history of things,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.280]   look, be able to look back and point at things
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.480]   is really important.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.000]   And it's something we need to be aware of
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.360]   as we're building these new services
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.560]   that we don't suddenly lose all our history
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.160]   because a service goes away.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.840]   - You think this is something that's well understood?
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.320]   I mean, we were talking last week
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.800]   about the word that you used "fatic"
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.120]   in your description of why Twitter succeeds,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.800]   which I kind of inelegantly said means
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.400]   social lubrication or social grease.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.840]   The stuff that doesn't carry information
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.240]   but carries social relationship.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.080]   And you said that's a social scientist term.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.160]   How good are social scientists?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.960]   How well have they predicted this?
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.200]   How well do they understand this?
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.040]   Or is this stuff completely terra incognita for them?
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.160]   - Lots of them are working on it.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.080]   There's lots of really interesting work going on there,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.800]   but there is a cultural divide, is it?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.440]   It was something that was very obvious to me at Google
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.760]   was that they had no idea that this work was going on
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.240]   in social sciences and that it was even relevant to writing.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.920]   'Cause they've got a very hard science,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.440]   reductionist, analytic worldview over there.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.360]   But if you look at, I'm sure you know,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.560]   the work of Dana Boyd, she's a very prominent
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.520]   social scientist who talks about this stuff,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.560]   but there's a large research community
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.800]   who look at social interaction.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.880]   And we've got a generation of researchers coming through now
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.720]   who have grown up with computers
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.360]   and use them as their tools rather than.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.640]   And so we have anthropologists who understand computation.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.280]   We have computer scientists who understand, not say it.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.080]   And I don't claim to be a social scientist
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.800]   by any stretch of the imagination,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.040]   but I find it fascinating to listen to them and read them
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.880]   and think about what they're saying
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.160]   and then try and connect the pieces back together.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   - Well, they've been thinking about this longer
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.240]   than any of us have.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   - Right.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   - That's a new context for them,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.240]   completely new context for them.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.080]   - Yes.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   Well, it's not a completely new context
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.960]   because people are still people.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.360]   So a lot of the things that they talk about map into this,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.440]   but as we're more able to talk to more people,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.200]   some of the possibilities change
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.520]   and some of the models that,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.280]   some of the assumptions that have been built
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.880]   based on how many people you can interact with
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.560]   start becoming more fluid.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   And I think that's an interesting point.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.560]   That's the sort of the change between,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   what, there's the idea of the Dunbar number
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   that you can't really know more than 150 people,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.720]   which is, you know, obviously that's an arbitrary number
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.920]   that's been made out of a series of curves.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.840]   But I think one of the things that we find is that as
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.320]   we move from the classic broadcast model
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.560]   to the overlapping public's idea that we have in Twitter
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.360]   and how we have on the web,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.120]   it is much more possible for you to interact with more people
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.840]   and have some sense of what they're doing
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.640]   and how they're there.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.800]   And so it becomes much more of a continuum
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.760]   rather than you have a small set of people
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.600]   who actually know, then you have some people
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.080]   that are sectioned off as professional broadcasters,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.000]   as sort of professional communicators.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.200]   There's actually much more of a continuum between the two.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.040]   - That I've seen.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   - Kevin, when I visited you at Google
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.840]   when you were still there,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.920]   you showed me a lot of stuff about not just communicating
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.240]   directly, but about your turkey tracks in the ground,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   what you do and what you see,
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.920]   like "Coffee and Post's Facebook" thing this week,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.160]   that that is your ambient intimacy
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.520]   and your presence online.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.320]   And so it's not just about communicating,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.720]   it's also about what sharing letting people in.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.760]   - Yes, so I mean, I think the activity stream stuff
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.120]   is a strong piece of this
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.560]   and that is keeping track of what you do
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.960]   on the web and being able to share that,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.200]   that's very useful because you're sending out
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   these sort of social signals to people
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   so that they can see what you're talking about
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.640]   and what you're thinking about.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   And it's also, the filtering piece is significant.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.480]   If we all look at several things
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.160]   and pass some of them through,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.560]   then we're providing a perspective on the web
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.640]   and saying this stuff is interesting,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.760]   this stuff is important.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.600]   And we've been doing that,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.920]   we've been doing that with blogs for a long time,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.040]   but the amount of effort to actually make a blog post
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.360]   that links to something is fairly high.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.440]   And so it becomes quite a strong filter,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.800]   but the amount of that you can do per day
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.360]   is unless you're sitting there all day
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.240]   writing 10 posts a day, you can't be doing that.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.840]   You would do one post every day or so.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   Whereas if you make it part of the experience
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.840]   of reading the web, of browsing the web and sharing it
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.760]   as we do now, where we click share buttons,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.400]   we retweet buttons, we do that kind of stuff,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.080]   in each case we're taking a large sort of incoming flow
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.600]   and saying this bit is the bit that I find interesting.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   So we start using each other as filters,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.120]   we become each other's media.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.000]   So rather than having an anointed committee of editors
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.320]   decide what the stories are and what the media is,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.920]   we have this massively parallel set of people choosing
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.840]   what the media is, then each of us choose each other.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.120]   And that is a much more resilient structure
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.760]   for finding information.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.200]   - What does that do for Jeff for mainstream media?
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.720]   Does there a role for mainstream media
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.080]   in something like that?
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.720]   I mean, people keep saying maybe the aggregator
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.520]   is the future, but that's not even aggregation.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.560]   - I was at the Aspen Institute this last week,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.520]   presenting our new business models for news
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.280]   at the City University of New York where I teach.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.320]   And it was frankly a room filled with the establishment.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   And they have a great deal of trouble, I think,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.240]   drinking out of the idea that there are anything more
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.760]   than one way communicators of information that they gather.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.320]   - And the last thing they want to be is just a one among equals,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.240]   which it sounds like they've become in some ways.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.080]   - That's what they have to be.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.240]   If you're a member of a network, you're a member of a network.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.960]   And you have to contribute to the network
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.640]   and they cannot think like networks
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.480]   and they cannot think like platforms.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.560]   And they cannot think about trying to enable the community
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.960]   to organize itself and its information.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.400]   So that's what's screwing them up.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.080]   I think that if you look at the social world,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.000]   you can debate whether Google or Facebook
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.960]   or open social will win,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.680]   but you can be sure one thing media lost social long ago.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.520]   - Wow.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.280]   - But amongst all these self organizing communities though,
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.760]   people sharing information,
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.840]   I mean certain leaders do sort of emerge, right?
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.560]   Because they're really good, because they're really vocal,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.720]   because they're compelling about the way that,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   they share the things that they do.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.200]   So I mean, that's one way the media could go
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   is try to be compelling while being one of the individuals.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.800]   - True, I mean, or is that an interim feature of it?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.040]   I mean, what we're doing here, for instance,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.320]   we're talking heads, we're not so very different
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.480]   than the original mainstream media,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.080]   although it's kind of new media.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.240]   Is that an interim thing?
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.160]   Is this just a temporary adjustment
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.800]   that will go away as well?
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.920]   Say it's not so?
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.080]   - When I was out at Aspen, Marissa Meyer was there
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.640]   and there's a lot of talk of hyper local journalism
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.760]   and that's what I was pushing was a network of hyper local
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.960]   plus a new news organization,
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.840]   plus a framework to optimize it,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.800]   which was just a short step.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.280]   She went beyond and basically said to the mockers
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.200]   who were there, you ain't seen nothing yet folks
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.040]   and started talking about hyper personal news streams.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.680]   And that's not unfamiliar to us with Twitter and Facebook,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.800]   but if you look at the media people,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.640]   they still think that the reader has to come to them
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.680]   to get the news.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.240]   And the whole idea that they have to insinuate themselves
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.960]   into your stream through probably your peers
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.880]   and use data to do that better and more efficiently
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.520]   for you and filter themselves.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   Basically, they've had 15 years since the web,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   what commercial and they didn't figure it out.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.840]   Now it's going through another huge step change
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.280]   and they're behind again.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.040]   - When you say mockers, you mean mockers?
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   - Yes, our emferets.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.880]   - Or mockers.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.200]   - Or mockers.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.280]   - Should hear me say cha-cha.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.120]   - I wasn't sure if it was, well it could be either,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.960]   it could be MOCK mockers or it could be MACHER mockers.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.400]   - No, there's little humor there.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.320]   - No, it was a good pun.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.600]   For an Episcopalian, a Yiddish pun, that's very good.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.000]   How, where does Kevin, where do you think a wave
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.160]   and the new Google reader fit into this?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.120]   Are these attempts from Google to try to find ways
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.520]   into this new kind of aggregate?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.720]   - Well, there's about different kinds of things.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.160]   Reader is very much this, yes.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.760]   Reader is a good feed reader, I use it all the time.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   It's had a share button for a long time.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.360]   Making that social was quite hard,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.560]   I remember the first attempt really threw people
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.240]   because we were using at the time,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.760]   the just the G talk buddy,
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.560]   'cause that was the only friend graph we had.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.240]   And that was so disjoint, people didn't get it.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.720]   If you look at what they've done now,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.240]   they're actually drawing in a different set of friends
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.720]   and there's a better friend model in there.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   - We talked about this last week,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   I think we're still pretty confused by the whole thing.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.640]   - It is, yeah.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.880]   Well, they've added six different buttons
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   that do slightly different variations on a theme.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.680]   So yeah, I can see this in confusion there.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.400]   What we're trying to do with the activity stream stuff
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.640]   is look at lots of these different models
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.960]   and come up with the common verbs
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.360]   and then map them through.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.160]   And I think, yeah, I think Google Reader
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.720]   has more buttons, maybe than it needs.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.920]   - But not more buttons than a Chevy Impala, so you're okay.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.440]   - But it's, you know,
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.200]   but they're different kinds of gestures.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.720]   And there is a difference between star,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.520]   starring this saying, I want to read this later
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   and clicking it saying, I want to share this with other people.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.760]   And I suspect we'll see more coalescing of the sharing parts
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.920]   because there are three or four ways of sharing it.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.000]   - Can you tell me what the difference is?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.640]   'Cause I'm not clear at all.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.120]   - Well, no, they, on Reader?
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.920]   - Yeah.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.400]   - What is the difference between starring, liking and sharing?
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   - Okay.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.960]   - She's not a going-glady more.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.800]   We should go ahead.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.240]   - I'm not blaming you for this, I understand Kevin.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.720]   You don't have to defend it,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.800]   but it sounds like you know.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.680]   So the historic thing was you started
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.960]   and you got to feed for yourself
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.360]   and you shared it and you got to feed that went out to others.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.080]   And that still works.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.880]   So you've got to, if you look at the star stuff,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.560]   you can see my starred items
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.760]   and that that people tend to use that for,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.880]   I should read this later.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.720]   - Right.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.560]   - Just as you do in New York.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.400]   - Yeah, a bookmark.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.240]   Okay, so that's a bookmark kind of.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.640]   - It's like a personal bookmark.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.480]   - Okay.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.920]   - The share is more like,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.840]   I want to send this out to the,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   but this was the thing I was talking about,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.880]   about reading the news and saying,
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.760]   that bit's good, other people should read this
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.400]   and you're feeding that out again.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.080]   And so other people can see that.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.760]   Now, they built that a long time ago
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.280]   and the problem was the feeds were, you know,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   some hideous URL that you could never type or remember
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.760]   and they could barely copy and paste.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.280]   And so making that discover was a good idea.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.640]   So now you can see the shared items at a URL
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.680]   and you can actually discover those
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.880]   'cause you can find your friends through the friend graph
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.240]   and also you can pump that out to friend feed and so on
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   and you can get them from Google profile.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.840]   So they've decided to plug the pieces together there.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.400]   Now, like, I think was,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.040]   basically the same idea or share.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.200]   It's just saying I like this thing.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   It's a one click button,
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.400]   but it's not shared individually.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.560]   It's only shared in aggregate as far as I can tell.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.960]   So the point of it is it's supposed to be,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.400]   if you click like, you're not saying,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.800]   "This is good enough for me to feed it out to everyone."
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.120]   You're just saying, "This is good,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.720]   "you know, general thumbs up."
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.440]   And then they can add up all the liked ones
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.840]   and show you the most liked things.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   So yeah, I think--
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.160]   - I'll have friend feeder, I guess, now Facebook.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.280]   - So it's adding a little meta.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.120]   - It's adding a little meta.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.960]   - It's a little overloaded.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.880]   It's a little overloaded.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   - Yeah.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.840]   - And, you know, I'm not sure we need that many.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.320]   And then they've also got a send to as well,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.880]   which is even, because that's a send out or something else.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.640]   So they're trying out lots of things in there,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   you know, which is nice.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.360]   You know, there's a choice of different ways
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.400]   you can play with it.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.480]   I suspect we'll get better at this over time
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.560]   and come up and convert some of these verbs,
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.080]   especially as you bridge stuff between sites.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.120]   And that was something that friend feed did do very well.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.960]   - Yeah.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.800]   - Or still does very well, actually.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.640]   So I shouldn't talk about it in the past then.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   - I don't need to do that though.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.480]   (laughs)
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.600]   I don't know what's gonna, we asked Paul to be on the show
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.680]   and he will once he's settled in a little bit
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.880]   and his breath is...
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.960]   - I'm sure there's lots to do there, yeah.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.600]   - Yeah, there's a lot going on there.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.440]   How about wave?
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.280]   So, okay, so I think...
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.120]   - So wave, okay.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.480]   So wave is something different.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   The point about wave is that it's actually
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.600]   a document editing system.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.480]   It's a way of doing collaborative editing.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.760]   And the other stuff that they've shown
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.680]   for doing conversations in it
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.280]   is built on that model of collaborative editing.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.560]   And so that's why it's actually quite hard
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.000]   to integrate it with all these other things
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.560]   because it's really edits to a shared document.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   A wave is a shared document that you edit collaboratively
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.480]   just as you would with a Google document
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.720]   or with sub ether edit if you remember that.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   - Yeah, from still user.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.040]   - For the Mac, yeah.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.880]   So the basic model of wave is very like sub ether edit.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.840]   It's there is a document, you're editing it together.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.960]   The OP transform has been that you can do that in...
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.480]   Well, without much delay.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.520]   I'm not gonna say in real time
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   because the interesting thing is it isn't actually real time.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   What the protocol does is let you consolidate edits that happen.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.760]   If I do an edit and you do an edit
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.280]   and then we send the edits to each other,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.600]   we end up with the same result
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.080]   with the operational transform.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.000]   We don't have to wait for each other to do it.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.480]   So that even though we're not,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.360]   it means that we can get away with more latency
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.760]   between our connection because we end up with the same result.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.880]   And so it actually means that it feels more real time
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.480]   than the system that is actually doing
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.800]   a only one person edit a time model.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.280]   - It feels like there's no latency at all,
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.840]   which I think is one of the things that scares people
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.120]   a little bit about wave.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   It's all happening real fast.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   - Well, that's the thing is it's the...
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.600]   If you've got it down to the point
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   where you're doing character by character edits,
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   then yes, you're not sending out a chunk of stuff,
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.120]   as you are even in Twitter.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.040]   In Twitter, you write a little thing
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.080]   and send out a chunk of stuff
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.560]   and you have that thing that makes sense.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.240]   If you're doing character by character,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.280]   then you have to pay attention to it.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.840]   But it does consolidate up into a document.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.080]   You end up with a document at the end of it,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.720]   and that's the point.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.760]   And the history of the edits is in the document.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.520]   You can play it back. - I love that.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.000]   - But the basic model is you're editing a document together.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.240]   But that means that part of
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.400]   an eel's objection to it was they're trying
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   to reinvent the entire web.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.560]   He wrote a new talk about someone this week.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.640]   - We were talking about it, yeah.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.120]   And he's, yeah, you can argue they've made up
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.400]   too many protocols, but in that particular case,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.560]   it's kind of fun 'cause there wasn't
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.240]   a good shared document protocol.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.200]   So making up one for that is a good thing.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.840]   But that also means that it is quite hard
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.320]   to sort of plug it into other systems
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.240]   because the other systems have a sense of,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.480]   primarily a sense of individual messages
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.160]   in a flow with timestamps,
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.320]   and waves, primary thing is his document
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.160]   has edits to it.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.280]   And so transforming between those two models
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.080]   is quite tricky.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.000]   You wouldn't want every edit to a document
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.200]   to be sent out to you over Twitter.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.800]   That would be really annoying.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.960]   So again, it's this, what is the right
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.200]   latency of interaction thing,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.680]   and how do you match the latency's problem?
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.320]   So my second wave is that it's interesting
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.720]   and that we're working on stuff to connect to it
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.360]   as are lots of other people.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.680]   But to assume that it will overnight replace
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.960]   IME mail and Twitter is to miss the point a little bit
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.680]   because what it does is a very, very powerful
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.640]   document collaboration tool.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.280]   But that means that it ends up being a lot more coupled
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   than these systems are.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.920]   - All right.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   (laughs)
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.960]   I'm gonna absorb that all.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.280]   Yes, it does.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.800]   And really what it sounds like is I have to almost
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.400]   recontextualize what I thought wave was.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.200]   I think maybe the RASMUSMS led us a little bit
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.000]   by saying the future of email.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   - Yeah, I was gonna say that they didn't come out the gate
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.400]   and say this is a document collaboration system
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.360]   because that wouldn't generate as much excitement
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.320]   as we're gonna reinvent email,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.280]   which is a really pretty kind of exciting and ambitious.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.440]   But if you think about an email that's responded
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.880]   that many people reply to and quote,
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.200]   it is essentially a document that's just getting edited
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.280]   asynchronously, but yeah, I think that it's,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.840]   the more realistic thing is to explain wave
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.800]   just the way you did, which is that it's a document
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.520]   collaboration system like sub-ethad it,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.480]   but that wouldn't mean anything to a lot of people.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.320]   That wouldn't be as exciting.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.400]   - Right, that's why I also think
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.920]   it's important for news and the creation of content then
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.960]   is when I saw wave, that's what I saw,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.120]   is that it's a new way for a bunch of people to collaborate
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.880]   on something and to publish it live to the world
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.640]   and then to collaborate in turn.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.680]   True?
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.480]   - That second part is the part that I'm not sure about,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   to be honest with you.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.560]   - Well, a closed group.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.360]   - Yeah, it seems to work well with a closed group.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.520]   - It feels, yeah, so in terms of replacing email,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.240]   if you think about how, I don't know if your Gmail users,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.400]   with ordinary email, you end up with all this sort of
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.240]   massively nested quoting, and Gmail hides out a way
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.880]   to show you just the bit that's new.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.000]   And so you're seeing the updates, which they've done
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.440]   quite a good job of extracting that stuff out,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.760]   to the point is where people complain about Gmail users
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.960]   never actually deleting anything,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.280]   they just keep sending more and more stuff in each thing.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.800]   And so I think it was that reaction to that model
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.120]   of having a very email intensive collaboration
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.840]   where you are adding more and more stuff to the stream,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.360]   but the document's becoming unwieldy.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.960]   I think that was their reinvention of email.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.080]   They said, okay, well actually we're trying to collaborate
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.160]   on something here, wouldn't be better
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.360]   if we were collaborating on the thing.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.800]   So they have, what they've tried to reinvent
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.360]   is the process of collaborating over email
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.760]   with the process of collaborating on a document,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.760]   and they've done an interesting job of that.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.200]   And there are other things that do things like that.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800]   Wikis do something like that,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.680]   but they're interactions of a creek here often.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.120]   And Google Docs does that as well.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.440]   Google Docs tacitly has a document that's shared,
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.200]   and it does a pretty good job of letting
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.520]   a lot of people edit it at the same time.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.160]   It's not quite as close to the wire as wave is,
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.640]   but it's got a deploy system that's working
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.240]   with millions of people.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.440]   So there's definitely some value there.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   So I think it's not that,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.280]   I think what is, is they said, okay,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.760]   if we started from this idea, what could we do with it?
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.600]   And they've done that.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.520]   And then they've worked as far along as,
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   and we can do these other modalities
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.760]   that you're used to inside it.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.040]   But it's gonna take a while for people
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.600]   to work out what it is that they want to be using it for.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.200]   But it is, I think, to Jeff's point,
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.440]   I think it works very well for a sort of set of collaborators,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.680]   of known collaborators.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.840]   I think it'll be trickier if you open up
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.440]   to a broader set of collaborators,
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   because you'll run into all the sort of
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.680]   wiki governance problems you already run into.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.000]   So you'll end up having to have people
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.440]   who are sitting there doing wave gardening
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.320]   and so on, like you're doing wiki gardening
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   and making sure that people don't sort of,
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.920]   wallpaper it with nonsense and things.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.160]   Yeah, that struck me as well,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.920]   that that might be, come a quickly, become an issue.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.360]   - I think I was just there at the invention
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.680]   of new jargon, wave gardening,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.000]   is that the first time it's been said?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.120]   - Like wiki gardening, I think it is the first time, yes.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.160]   Wiki gardening's been around though, yeah?
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.000]   - Oh yeah.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.320]   - We'll call it wave gardening.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.920]   (laughing)
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.040]   Well, I think that's, yeah, in a way,
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.760]   I think that that helps me recontextualize what wave is
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.040]   and understand it a lot better to think of it that way.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.840]   Somebody said it's not reinventing email.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.960]   Peasier said this in our chat room,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   it's reinventing inter-office email.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.000]   Inter-office email, that makes sense.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.320]   Well, I'm glad you could explain this.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   We don't wanna put you on the spot
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.360]   'cause I know you had, you know,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.200]   this isn't your gig, man, anymore.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.480]   Fascinating, it's fascinating stuff.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.760]   Couple of stories in our,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.440]   we have a friend feed room and we will have it
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.400]   as long as friend feeds around.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.480]   It is friendfeed.com/twit-twig
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.880]   and Jeff and Gina and I put stories in there
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.960]   and it's a good place if you wanna go
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.000]   to see what we're up to.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.960]   And I actually add stories or to add comments to a story
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.240]   so that we can comment about them.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.200]   You guys have been much harder workers than I have this week.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.480]   Wanna pick one, Gina, from your list in here?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.960]   Did you like to talk about it a little bit?
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.760]   - Yeah, sure, let's pick one.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.520]   - I put you on the spot there, I'll give you a bunch of rap.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.840]   - I bought your app, Gina.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.800]   - Yeah, let's talk about your app.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.640]   This is interesting.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.480]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.600]   - You created a Twitter app,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.440]   but it's a self-served Twitter app.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.480]   Tell us about that.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.840]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.600]   I was kind of a personal programming project.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.440]   I'm calling it right now, it's Twitter-lytic.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.880]   It's a PHP application that you install on your own server
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.360]   much like WordPress.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.240]   And what it does is it archives your tweets
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.560]   so it crawls your Twitter stream constantly.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.000]   You schedule the crawler to run pretty often.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.240]   This is pretty nerdy stuff so just wanna--
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.320]   - Sorry, we're all nerds here.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.520]   - Just claim marry, we're all nerds here.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.680]   So I can say these things.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.520]   I can say things like you crawl in the crawler
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.880]   to run once an hour.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   It grabs your tweets, it grabs responses to your tweets.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.400]   And it does basically analytics.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.560]   My vision is it is gonna be doing analytics
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.920]   on your Twitter presence, right?
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.360]   So it tells you things like,
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.320]   who are the least likely people who are following you?
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.560]   Least likely being like,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.320]   who are the people who have the most followers
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.280]   and the fewest friends who are following you?
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.320]   Which ones of your tweets have the most responses?
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.640]   And it actually creates a view,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.280]   which is each one of your tweets.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.840]   And then you can drill down and see the responses
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.320]   to those tweets.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.080]   You can curate responses to your tweets,
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.160]   meaning like most Twitter clients,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.280]   if you click on the reply to button,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.760]   it associates the response to your tweet,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.160]   but not all users do that.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.560]   So you can assign replies,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.040]   oh, this reply belongs to this tweet.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.240]   This reply belongs to this tweet.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.600]   So then you can link to your tweet and say,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.360]   hey, I sent out this lazy web Twitter
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.520]   about what's your favorite Twitter client.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.040]   And here's what everybody said.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.320]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.840]   - Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm really using it for,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.000]   because I'll be honest,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.680]   I crowdsource a lot of the stuff that I write
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.200]   on Life Hacker and a Smart Aware.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.840]   And it's really easy for me to say,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   like, think like, hey, I've got these 10 great things,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.520]   but I want to ask my followers first.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   So I've been using it for that.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.560]   And yeah, that's it.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.920]   It's just kind of the first iteration.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.440]   I've been working on it for a few months.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.600]   I just put it out this past Thursday.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.200]   And interestingly, I think it was Thursday, yeah.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.880]   - Interestingly, that same day,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.840]   Biz Stone said that Twitter was going to start offering
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.960]   commercial, premium commercial accounts for businesses
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.400]   who have Twitter accounts that will offer
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.840]   detailed analytics.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.160]   So I felt like kind of a jerk,
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.520]   like releasing an app that's like,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.960]   just totally navel-gazy.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.480]   None of us wants to admit how often we look
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   at like Google Analytics or site meter,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.840]   but I felt kind of justified, like, oh, okay,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.800]   well, Twitter's offering this
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.960]   as a little bit of a business model.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.360]   So maybe I wasn't totally off the rest.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.960]   - That all sounds really useful.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   Did you hit API limits?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.720]   Do you have problems with getting all the information?
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.000]   - Yeah, so the Twitter API limit currently
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.160]   is 150 calls per hour.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.480]   So I built into the crawler.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.000]   The crawler backs off given a certain number, right?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.960]   So if the crawler runs 20 minutes after the hour
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.640]   and there are 40 minutes left in the hour,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.720]   it says, okay, you've got 150 calls.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   I'm only going to use like 20 of them, right?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.840]   Because we don't want to lock anybody out
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.680]   of their Twitter client.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.880]   So the crawler does that pretty quickly.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.200]   And you can set it to be very aggressive
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.680]   or not very aggressive at all.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.600]   - Without access to the fire hose, though,
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   you think you might miss some content?
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.280]   You'll see all your content, I guess.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.200]   - Yeah, you get all of your content.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.320]   And then, so it only grabs content
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.480]   from people that you care about.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.200]   So your own stuff replies to your own stuff,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.440]   your friends stuff.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.560]   So it's kind of like in levels of importance, right?
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.640]   And then your followers stuff last.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.480]   - Right.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.320]   And I tell you, if you run it for as long
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   as I've been running it for about a month,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.200]   you get a lot of data.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   I mean, I've got a table with eight million rows in it
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.640]   just from like 12 users.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.320]   You know, just grabbing like your friend's stuff
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.120]   and their friends, because it figures out things
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.400]   like mutual friends, so I can look at Jeff, say,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.320]   for example, and say, who are both me and Jeff following?
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.800]   So yeah, it sucks in a lot of data,
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.440]   but it does stop at a point.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.280]   (laughs)
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.120]   - Yeah.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.560]   This is what to me is the success of Twitter
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.960]   is that they did so little themselves
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.320]   and they gave you an API to do so much more.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.640]   And what's great is that as usual,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.840]   the founders don't know what the best uses of anything are.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.240]   So they've let people like you figure out better
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.800]   and more interesting ways to use it.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.160]   Sounds like you've got something really cool.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.000]   - It's cool.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.840]   You really have to be super engaged with Twitter
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   to see value in it.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   I mean, a lot of people looked at it and was like,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.200]   this looks cool, but I don't know what I would do it
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.400]   with any of these numbers.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   I've got, you know, 100 followers
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.000]   and I don't really Twitter that much.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.600]   I mean, on the opposite of the spectrum,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.320]   I've been Twittering for two years straight.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   I'm approaching the 3,200 mark after which
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.160]   my tweets won't be accessible via the API.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.880]   So I had a vested interest in backing up my tweets
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   because literally Twitter's been my kind of personal blog
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.760]   the last couple of years
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.320]   'cause I was just busy blogging at Life Hacker
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.040]   and I wasn't doing my own personal stuff.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.120]   So, you know, it's interesting.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.400]   Kevin was saying earlier,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.560]   he pointed out that the great thing about Twitter
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.600]   is this flow, right?
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   That things kind of go by and if you miss them,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.520]   it's no big deal.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.280]   And Neil talked about this last week too.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.520]   I love the Neil's analogy.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.960]   He said, if you arrive at a party late,
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.440]   there's no expectations that you have to go back
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.160]   and hear all the conversations that you miss.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.680]   - Right, say me.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.520]   - Which is true, but at the same time,
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.360]   like I do want the record of my own tweets,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.560]   you know, for the past two years.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.600]   I actually sometimes refer to my Twitter stream
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.640]   like, what was that party?
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.720]   Or what was that thing that I did?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.000]   I know I twitted about that.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.680]   Or someone will reply to me, you know,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.040]   something interesting and then, you know,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.640]   it gets lost or I need it later
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.240]   and so it totally kind of backs up in archives
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.960]   and also offers those different views.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.920]   - I'm just gonna rate you that
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.760]   'cause I came to think of my blog
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.720]   as blogs were originally intended as a place to store stuff
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.960]   and not just share stuff.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.840]   So when I put it in Twitter, I think I've stored it
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.320]   and I really haven't.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.160]   - No, no.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.000]   - Yeah.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.720]   - I have a plugin that for WordPress
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.280]   that automatically digests my tweets
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   and once a week puts them in the blog
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.400]   so I can search them and stuff.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.760]   So I have been saving that stuff for some time.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.160]   But I like the addition, I like the, you know,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.840]   I think you're right, the idea of collating responses
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.160]   to a lazy tweet, lazy web tweet is really valuable.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.360]   I had to like cut and paste it,
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.560]   put it in a notebook and stuff like that
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.960]   and you don't get everything.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.880]   It's really nice to have all that stuff.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.680]   - So this is kind of what we're getting out
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.440]   with the activity stream stuff.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.040]   The point of this is you wanna keep track
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.840]   of all the actions you're taking in different places
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.240]   and draw them back together again.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.200]   So activity streams is trying to standardize this
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.360]   so you can do it across different sites
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.000]   and not just pick the one site that you're focused on
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.760]   whether it's Twitter or Facebook or whatever and do it for that.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.680]   But have a standard you can move stuff between sites.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.080]   The other thing this reminds me of is there's a project
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   that Adrian and Lukas has been proposing for a while
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.000]   called the mine project.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.920]   With the idea is that you have a bunch of information
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.480]   that is yours, that is mine, if you like.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.800]   And you store that yourself and then you give out fees
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.880]   to other people that fees that information out.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.680]   So I mean, treat that you're doing it on your own server
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.200]   and not doing it on a machine somewhere
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.920]   and then trying to scale out to lots of users.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.080]   You're saying, no, this is actually mine.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.400]   I wanna keep this for myself.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.880]   And I will let some of this information out
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.600]   but I'm most interested in profiling myself
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.200]   as I move through the net.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.960]   And there's a strong fit there with Adriano's thoughts
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.680]   on this 'cause she's very focused on,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.200]   I want to draw back the information
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.800]   that I've spread out to these different websites
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.840]   and put it back together and analyze it for my own reasons
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.600]   and understand what I've been doing
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.400]   so that I can correlate my restaurant visits
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.240]   and my travel and the people I've been talking to
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.600]   and the tweets I've been making
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.320]   and then draw those back together to make sense of that.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.880]   But also have a store of your own information
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.800]   that you selectively let pieces of it out.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.200]   So the goal when we're defining a lot of these open standards
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.760]   is to be really clear that it doesn't matter
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.880]   who you're talking to on the other end of the protocol.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.160]   Not only should you not have to have
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.000]   a business relationship with that person,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.160]   you shouldn't even have to know if that they exist
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.280]   as long as you're talking the same protocol
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.880]   and you can move stuff back and forth.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.360]   And that's the sort of true power of the open spec process
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.840]   of having a spec where people can interoperate
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.800]   without knowing each other exists.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.640]   And that once you get to that point,
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.520]   then you're able to build these interesting long chains
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.680]   of things.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.480]   So obviously I wonder if Gina had looked at connecting
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.560]   to other kinds of feeds, connecting to streams
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.000]   from other services as well.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.360]   - Yeah, I mean, I would love to do that.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.200]   That's totally ideal.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.560]   I mean, I chose Twitter just 'cause it was the place
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.800]   where I spent the most time
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.840]   and a project that encompassed all those other things.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.400]   I mean, I'm glad you're doing this.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.240]   (laughing)
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.880]   It's a big project.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.160]   But I really like having stuff that I make
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.760]   on my own server, like having a copy of it on my own server.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.280]   I like having my data on my own server.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.680]   I like having my blog hosted there.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.880]   I like having a backup.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.720]   Just in case things go wrong, I have it.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.280]   I got really freaked out when I realized
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.200]   that Twitter's API doesn't give you any tweets
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   beyond like 3200, which I know is a high number.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   And I know that it's probably an issue of scale for them.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.600]   But like, I was just like, so if I,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.040]   I saw fight Twitter more than 3200 times,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   then it's just gone.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.360]   Like I can't retrieve that again.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.640]   - Well, can you really go back to one
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.880]   if you've got 3200 tweets?
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.000]   I didn't even know you could go that far back.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.200]   - Yeah, you can via the API, you can go back 3200 tweets.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.520]   So it's a page of 100 tweets.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.080]   You can do 32 pages, which is generous.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.960]   But like, you know, it's like, I don't know.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.840]   Everyone wants to know, hey, what was my first tweet
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.480]   back in '06?
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.560]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.600]   - Right.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.880]   - Crap, you know, I feel like I just talk too much,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.680]   which people tell me, because I've been doing it
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.240]   a lot less than you have, and I see that I have 4500.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.240]   (laughing)
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.600]   - Well, if it makes you feeling better,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.400]   I only have 2500, and I've been doing it to 2007.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.440]   So six.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.280]   So--
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.080]   - I'm heading up to 10,000, my son said,
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.440]   can you make me your 10,000th tweet,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.920]   which I thought was very sweet.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.760]   - Aww.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.600]   - Isn't that?
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   Aww.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.080]   That's the modern family.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.360]   I want to be the 10,000th.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.600]   - So I've got to keep track of the number now,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   'cause I wasn't looking before.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.800]   - It sounds like you would like fever, Gina.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   Have you played with that at all?
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   That's the--
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.120]   - I haven't, but it's totally on my list.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.720]   Yeah, that's the aggregator that Sean Inman made, right?
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.560]   - Right.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   - Also self-hosted.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.880]   - Also self-hosted.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.600]   Well, you know, Matt Howie, Twitter,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.000]   after he saw the thing about Switalitik,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.880]   he Twitter'd something like, you know,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.520]   I hate reading about great projects
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.080]   that lead to a link to GitHub.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   It's like saying, you know, what, what, I scream?
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.920]   And then pointing to the rocks.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.760]   - Making yourself.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.600]   - Making yourself.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.680]   (laughing)
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.520]   Right.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   So, yeah, that, valid point.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.600]   - Did you ever consider, Ken Shepertson's asking,
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.480]   did you ever consider putting it on using
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   a Google App Engine for this?
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   - Oh, that's a good, I hadn't really thought about it.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.280]   - Seems like it'd be a natural for that.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.600]   - And then the thing is, the database blows up so quickly.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.720]   I mean, if you've got, you know, a decent network of friends,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.600]   so I'm getting your friends, and then their friends,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.960]   and your followers, and then all their tweets,
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.240]   I mean, the database gets really big, really fast,
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.480]   and all I want is my slice of Twitter,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.760]   that the stuff that has some relation to me,
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.960]   either someone who I've said, I wanna follow this person,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.480]   or someone who has followed me,
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.640]   or someone who has replied to me,
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.480]   so like, as soon as you start registering more than,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.840]   you know, a dozen users, the database gets enormous,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.200]   then you have to deal with the scaling issues
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.280]   that Twitter does.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.000]   I imagine the App Engine would have a higher threshold
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.400]   than, you know, Dreamhost does,
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   which is where I'm hosting mine.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.600]   But, you know, it just, it gets enormous.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.680]   So that's why I feel like, you know,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.200]   just let people, people who really care,
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.520]   and can run a server, just, you know,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.080]   have them installed on their own box,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.040]   and then they can configure it to work the way they want.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.000]   - I'm downloading it right now.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.320]   Requires PHP and MySQL.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.440]   - Yep.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.160]   - And-- - Gina, what happens with,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.960]   and I hope I presume we'll talk about this momentarily,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.760]   but what happens with metadata, like,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.680]   Geo tagging, which is, they announced this week
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.400]   as adding to Twitter.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.960]   - That is very, very excited.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.000]   I'm really excited about all the API upgrades.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.200]   There was the retweet thing announced with that they made,
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.600]   which is, retweets are gonna be presented
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.760]   a little more differently, and then the Geo stuff this week,
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.240]   which you got really excited about, Jeff,
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.920]   and actually, Jeff, you came up with a lot more interesting
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.520]   possibilities from the Geo stuff.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.720]   I wanted to build in maps.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.160]   I wanted to say, tell me, you know,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.000]   if somebody follows me who's in San Diego,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.240]   'cause the San Diego tech community
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   is in as large as in San Francisco or New York,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.480]   like, I wanna know, let me know.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.960]   That kind of thing, I would like to--
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.480]   - Hugely valuable, yeah.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.880]   - Definitely, definitely.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.240]   - Any metadata you can add to a tweet
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.560]   is gonna make it more valuable.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.440]   But geographic, especially.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.600]   - Geographic does so much of it.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.120]   Again, I always look at it from the news
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.000]   and media perspective,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.640]   but imagine during the Tehran crisis
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.800]   that you would've been able to verify better
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.160]   who were really witnesses to things.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.040]   News, I would set up an app to look at
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.440]   huge bursts of activity around and address,
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.000]   and that's gonna tell me that news is happening,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.840]   or else it was a hell of a good party on.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.320]   You could use it for things like the collaborative projects,
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.040]   like the fabled, you know, big pothole report,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.640]   kind of like, a sequel like Fix.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.480]   I wanna see in my town,
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.000]   I really have no sense of my neighbor's tweeting,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.520]   though, where I live, there were old farts,
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.680]   and so probably nobody's tweeting,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.320]   but if there are a few people here,
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.560]   I'd love to see that.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   And then you start to think about
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.800]   the commercial applications as well as, you know,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.080]   what's going on near you in stores
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.520]   and restaurants and so on.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.080]   The other, finally, the other thing that fascinates me
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.280]   about it is starting to build an annotation level
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.400]   on the real world over time,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.120]   so that you can see a collection of restaurant reviews
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.480]   through Twitter done just saying, you know,
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   this is what this is like here.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.680]   It sort of is odd in the API from what I can see
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.360]   that they're gonna eliminate the geo data
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   after a certain amount of time,
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.920]   and that's why your model, Gina, is all the more important.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.280]   You wanna pull the stuff out of the API
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.600]   and analyze it separately.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.440]   - Exactly.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   - Do you think this is something Twitter
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.360]   is gonna be hostile to at some point
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.040]   since you, in fact, are kind of doing something
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.280]   they hope to monetize?
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.360]   - I don't think so.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.680]   I mean, I think Twitter's been really great.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.480]   I mean, there's so many third party apps, you know,
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.840]   for Twitter, it's such a predictable thing
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.520]   for a developer to work on, right?
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.040]   And I mean, you know, there's two stats
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.600]   and there's lots of products actually
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.720]   that do similar things to what Twitter-ledic does.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.400]   And, you know, Biz said in his announcement
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.520]   about the fact that they were gonna offer this for businesses
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.120]   that, you know, he didn't wanna disturb
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.000]   the kind of ecosystem of third party developers.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.400]   And I would say, I believe him.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.160]   I mean, they've been really good and really generous
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.120]   with developers and with the API calls,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.240]   they just up the limit from 100 to 150,
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.640]   I nearly threw a party that day.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.080]   That was really exciting 'cause I could get a lot more data
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.920]   a lot faster.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.160]   I was doing things like saying,
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.680]   if it's three in the morning, go to the limit.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.800]   (laughing)
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.960]   But if it's noon, only, you know, only make like 10 calls.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.000]   (laughing)
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.120]   - Are you updating this so much that we better
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.280]   to install through Git than to download a tarball?
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.880]   - You can download the tarball for now.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.480]   I actually, I haven't even tagged a release number.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.440]   So what you down will be exactly what's up to date right now,
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   which is mostly working.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   Other people have installed it and got it working.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.680]   I have confirmed so it actually is working.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.960]   That was also very exciting.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.600]   - That's my project for tonight.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.440]   - Yeah.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.280]   - I can't wait.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.960]   That sounds like so much fun.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.400]   - I wanted to back to Jeff a bit about the geographic stuff
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.600]   'cause I think the Iran example is interesting
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.880]   for another reason because actually what happened was
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.440]   people said everyone changed your location to Iran
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.280]   to create noise so people can't find out what's going on.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.160]   So being able to sort of perform your location
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.600]   rather than actually setting it as part of this as well,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.120]   you need to be able to say,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.440]   I'm interested in this place even if you're not there.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.760]   And that's part of the location stuff
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.120]   that's often a bit subtle.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.880]   If you're watching a conference
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.000]   that a lot of other people at,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.400]   you may want to set your location to that place
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.880]   so that you're in the cloud there.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.760]   So there's some interesting nuances to this.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.400]   - The other one Kevin, I think you're right is,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.080]   well, there's a privacy issue and the default
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.440]   as I understand is that you turn this off and you opt in.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.520]   There's a veracity issue of am I really here
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.960]   or am I faking it and then how valuable does the geo become
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.800]   at all?
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.040]   And so it's gonna be very interesting
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.400]   to see how it gets used.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   I think the problem, you know,
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.120]   four squares interesting too,
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.600]   but it doesn't have the critical mass.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.800]   Twitter comes in with the critical mass.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.920]   The other issue is that it's not just your phone
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.680]   and it's the new Firefox Google applications
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.560]   that lets you have your set browser on my laptop here
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.640]   and give it geographic location.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.120]   So geography added in, an annotation layer of geography
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   versus me, information versus geography,
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.720]   me versus time, geography versus time,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.320]   it all becomes just wonderful headache.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.240]   A good problem to have.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.360]   And as we look at a streamed web of news,
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.000]   you know, one of the problems with news coming forward
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.920]   is so that you are that witness somewhere
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.840]   and you saw the plane hit the helicopter of the Hudson.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.880]   And when I went in to Twitter right after that happened,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.720]   I searched for Hudson and there was somebody who said,
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.600]   oh my God, I just saw this.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.560]   And if I can verify that he's really a witness,
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.320]   what happens with those kinds of news events?
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.360]   It just, it changes the notion of news
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.880]   and you don't need reporters to get there.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.760]   You can't wait for reporters to get there.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.080]   News is witnesses.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.600]   Dave Weiner says that the thing about blogging is
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.040]   that the sources now blog, the sources now publish.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.320]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.520]   - Well, that was my parody of the,
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.600]   who was it?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.440]   Was it the AP?
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.760]   Was somebody complaining about people printing their stuff
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.840]   without paying them?
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.160]   And I did a sort of turn inside out and said,
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.280]   what about all the people you interview,
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.720]   you print their stuff without paying them.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.880]   And it's, it's, you know, I was being facetious.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.600]   But the point is that it's very true.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.680]   We have, we are all to each other's media.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.000]   We are able to report and say things
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.440]   and then we will decide what to pass on to whom.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.000]   And just there is this sort of spread of different people.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And you expect that.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.080]   You expect a sort of broad distribution of people
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.960]   that's that people listen to a little and people
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.800]   who listen to a lot.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.600]   That's what comes out of a, you know,
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.800]   what we call a small world network network
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   that gets stuff to travel a long way.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.480]   And the, oh, the other thing I wanted to ask Gina about
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.720]   was if she'd looked at Pub/Sub/Hubbub yet.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.360]   - Oh yeah, we've talked about it quite a bit.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.200]   - Oh yes.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   - Oh yes.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.960]   So the dream for it's what a little bit,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.280]   'cause to not only be an archiver and an analytics view,
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.720]   it's also to be a publisher and use Pub/Sub/Hubbub
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.520]   to sort of to push out tweets and get tweets.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.960]   I mean, you know, I don't know if this could ever actually
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.840]   happen, but if you know, you have a group of people
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.680]   who have total little installed in their own servers
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.160]   to be able to push those updates out to one another
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.240]   and then sync back to Twitter,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.760]   but have it sort of be distributed,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.200]   distributed and real time.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.960]   - Can you give me a use case so I could visualize
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.800]   what that would look like?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.200]   I'm not sure I understand how that would work.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.680]   - So when Twitter goes down, basically,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.040]   being able to push updates to your friends.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.240]   So every time you post a tweet,
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.800]   - You're creating a distributed Twitter.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.240]   - Yeah, distributed Twitter.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.520]   This is kind of the vision.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.240]   I'm not sure, I'm gonna see what I could do,
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.040]   but so every time you post a tweet,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.880]   there's a little field that says--
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.760]   - I love this 'cause you're backing into a distributed
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.600]   Twitter.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.400]   (laughing)
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.600]   - Every time you post a tweet,
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.960]   there's a little field that says what client you used.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.920]   So I could use that field to say,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.760]   this is where my instance of totalitic exists.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.600]   So I could, in theory, kind of detect, you know,
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.160]   where are my friends using totalitic
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.880]   and where is their server located
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.040]   and then be able to push updates to them?
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.800]   And I'd love to use something like Hubsub Hub Hub
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.560]   because it would be real time.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.640]   It would be notifications versus, you know, polling.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.040]   - This really encapsulates something
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.000]   that we've been talking about now
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.920]   for a couple of episodes.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.080]   This idea that people wanna pull it back to themselves,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.000]   be the hub instead of pushing all their content out
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   to other third parties, make the blog or whatever the hub,
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   but still wanna participate in these social graphs.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   And I guess that's really Kevin,
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.400]   what you've been pushing all along
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   is kind of owning your stuff but making it federate.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   - Well, the point is defining a Santa's in such a way
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.960]   that they will work for a company with 100 million users
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.600]   and they'll work for an individual with their own server.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.040]   So if you look at Open ID,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.120]   that is very much designed that way.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.640]   You can set up your own server that doesn't open ID,
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.120]   you can set your own blog up on a service, doesn't open ID,
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.520]   or you can use Google or Yahoo or AIM
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   or any of these other large companies
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.720]   that have set themselves up as Open ID providers.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.680]   So that is a protocol that clearly does that.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.920]   The challenge is doing that for some of these other things
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.240]   as well.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.360]   The point of the Open Social and the Portable Contact stuff
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.200]   was to do that for basically the list of people that you know
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.240]   for some value of no,
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.920]   but a way of having information about people about,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.680]   you know, photograph name and links
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.800]   to their other profiles and information
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.960]   in a standardized form and addresses and phone numbers
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.840]   and so on, that you can actually move between sites
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.520]   in a general way so that you don't have to recreate it
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.360]   every site you go to.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.760]   You can delegate to the sites they already exist at,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.680]   but you can self host as well as easily as you could host it
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.120]   in some special magic place like Twitter or Google or Yahoo.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   - I guess you have to have both
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.680]   because not everybody's gonna have GitHub
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.640]   and a PHP with MySQL available.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.360]   - Sure, no, you need both.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.920]   But the point is to define the protocol in such a way
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.160]   that you can have both.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.240]   Rather than it being, no, no, you have to go through this server
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.200]   or if you wanna call this, you have to sign
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.240]   a Biz Dev degree with us or that kind of model.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.120]   'Cause if you look at how the web was built,
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.160]   the web was built on protocols like this,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.960]   the web was built on a set of open protocols
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.200]   that meant that anyone could run a web server
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.040]   and there was an addressing scheme
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.560]   for getting it that was built on DNS,
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.680]   which another distributed system,
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.800]   which means you can resolve an address
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.200]   by asking a bunch of other people.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.080]   So if you look at the way the web is actually built
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   from the ground up, it's a set of distributed systems
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.800]   that are very non-specific about where you happen to be.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.600]   And this is making sure that we can do this
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.160]   with this next layer of the web as well,
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.120]   defining these protocols in these ways.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.640]   So the standards, if you look at the Deop and Web Foundation,
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.560]   which is something I'm involved with
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.960]   and these other standards groups
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.720]   that we've done these kinds of things,
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   the goal is to keep building standards and specifications
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.160]   that follow this mindset, that it doesn't matter,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.240]   doesn't matter where you are,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.560]   if you choose to draw information from that server,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.560]   you can do it.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.760]   And there's, yeah, there are problems with saying,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.360]   you can trust anyone.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.680]   There were some mistakes in the protocols,
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.080]   like email addresses, if anyone knows you may address,
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.040]   they can fill your inbox with noise, that's a problem.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.600]   Because the protocols define backwards,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.440]   is anyone can send you stuff.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.240]   Whereas if you can choose to receive from anyone,
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   that's much more resilient against noise.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.440]   - Seems like we're making good progress.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.760]   It seems like we're kind of converging now
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.000]   with all of these different ideas on something
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   that will soon be just accepted as being away doing it.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.040]   - I hope so.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.320]   That's the goal.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.200]   - It feels that way though.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.320]   I have to say, it feels that way.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.720]   There seems to be some consensus moving that way.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   And even the walled gardens like Facebook seem to be getting it.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.440]   - Yeah, there are definitely common threads.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.800]   I mean, we've been having this conversation
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   with lots of different people
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.840]   and the common threads emerge
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   and people are working on similar things.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.720]   I mean, my little weekend project is one thing,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.600]   but I mean, redefining new protocol,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.720]   the activity stream sounds really interesting.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.000]   Seeing Pub/Sub, how about, get distributed more widely,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.160]   even having wave come out.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.680]   I mean, this is all good stuff.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.520]   - Yeah, very cool.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.280]   - Moving towards similar goals, yeah.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.120]   - Exciting.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.520]   This is one of those shows
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.920]   where we could probably go for four hours as usual.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.400]   And I hate to cut it short,
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.080]   but I don't want to, I know it's pizza night
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.040]   in the Jarvis household.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.400]   And I don't want to cut any--
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.240]   - Well, you moved it earlier.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.400]   I'm really like going to ask you though,
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.000]   what's your thinking about the answers to the FCC this week
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.640]   about the Google Voice App?
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.960]   - Ah, well, I guess we probably should bring that up.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.800]   - Yeah, we have--
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.640]   - We have, we have--
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.760]   - Arrington screaming about Apple lies.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   We have Steve Gilmore.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.680]   I saw that Kevin tweeted earlier,
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.720]   treating into a wonderful conspiracy theory.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.800]   What does it all mean?
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.640]   - Alfie.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.160]   (laughing)
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.520]   - You're asking the wrong guy,
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.280]   if you expect me to understand any of it.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.240]   So let's synopsis, 'cause we did get the letters,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   or FCC got the letters from Google, AT&T and Apple.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.320]   AT&T said basically say,
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.520]   what you talking about, Willis?
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.920]   We didn't have anything to do with it.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.960]   We didn't talk to them, we didn't say anything.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.120]   Apple, how would you synopsize Apple's response?
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.240]   - Reject, who said reject?
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.520]   We're still thinking about it.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.280]   - Yeah, we didn't reject it.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.360]   - We have a lot of reasons.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.440]   - We were a lot of rejected,
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.160]   but we didn't really reject it yet.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   - And there was something to call back for a date.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.880]   - And there's some secret thing that it did
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.720]   that was a problem, but we're not gonna tell you.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.640]   - Well, that's more Google, 'cause Google says--
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.480]   - Here's what response was to us,
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.200]   but we're not gonna tell you what it was.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.560]   - Well, yeah, I mean, this is the thing that's so bizarre,
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.400]   right?
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.840]   As Google came out and said, they rejected it,
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.040]   but then in the letter, it was redacted,
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.120]   what they were told when they submitted the app.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   It's just, it's confusing.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.360]   I must be slow, 'cause I don't get it.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.840]   The conspiracy theory piece is kind of--
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.440]   - What is the conspiracy though?
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.120]   I mean, what conspiracy is going on,
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.000]   and who are the parties?
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.080]   - Kevin, can you translate to--
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.800]   - Translate to Steve Gilmore?
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.440]   - I can't always translate Steve Gilmore.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.400]   You tend to have to interpret Steve Gilmore
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.320]   than translate him.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.680]   I think, what he's saying is,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.320]   there are a lot of overlapping goals here.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.440]   That's what I was getting from his thing.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   The Apple thing was very explicit.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.680]   It said Apple has the freedom.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.840]   That was right at the top.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.200]   They get to decide what you see,
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.240]   and they really like that.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.080]   - We have all the freedom--
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.760]   - You have none of the freedom.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.200]   - That's our freedom.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.800]   - That was, so, and then they wrote a long essay
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.000]   on how they had to protect the iPhone
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.760]   from terrible third-party developers.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.320]   And the horrible things they might do.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.600]   That was three quarters of the essay.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.440]   And Google probably sent their entire correspondence
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.080]   with Apple, which may be why they redacted it,
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.400]   because they had stuff from Apple
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.560]   that they would have to get Apple's mission
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.400]   to show to the public.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.960]   That would be my non-experitorial theory there.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.360]   I haven't spoken to anyone at Google about this,
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.200]   so I don't know.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.040]   That would be my guess.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   The underlying tension is that each of these groups
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.280]   have a different set of interests
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.640]   that they care about,
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   and they're trying to fit the pieces together.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.520]   Apple has a very genuine interest
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.200]   in making sure that the iPhone experience
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.600]   is good and enjoyable,
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.400]   and isn't broken by bad apps.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.760]   And they obviously want to keep dangerous apps off there.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.280]   And they've just extended that into it
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.200]   this more paternalistic model of,
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.280]   no, no, we get to decide what's going on.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.400]   AT&T really don't want you to clog up their data network
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.240]   with phone calls,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.560]   because they have a phone network for doing that.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.760]   So they're trying to stop you doing that.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.560]   And also, their data network isn't all that.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.520]   So you probably are better off doing that stuff
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.720]   over Wi-Fi instead.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.920]   And Google's point of view is,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.880]   well, we want to do this stuff on the open web
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.120]   on open protocols.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.160]   We want to make sure that stuff can interoperate.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:36.120]   So we're going to build applications that point this out.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   The interesting thing for me is that the web still wins.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.760]   When they announced the iPhone,
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.440]   something I said was even Steve Jobs
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.280]   can't make, you know,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.960]   has to put the open spec of the web into this.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.880]   And Jobs gets that.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.560]   You know, they funded the development of WebKit
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.000]   and built out this great open source web rendering engine
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.640]   that means that the iPhone was basically a browser
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.000]   in your pocket for a long time.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.240]   And that's still a lot of what people use it for on the apps,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.160]   are sort of extra things that you can do with it.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.080]   But they aren't, you know,
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.720]   you can always do lots of stuff with the web.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.560]   And both Apple and Google are working on making sure
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.800]   that the web stays open and has, you know,
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.200]   we can extend open standards for doing animation,
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.400]   for doing audio and video and so on.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.560]   So there's, there is a set of commonality there,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.720]   even though there's sort of,
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.040]   there's some contention over different bits
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.640]   and pieces of this here.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.440]   I thought some of the,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.120]   the Apple stuff was rather spurious,
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.640]   the replacing thing, that doesn't make sense to me.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.080]   Because they do allow, you know, Skype on there,
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.560]   which is also effectively replacing the phone call part.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.920]   And obviously I have an interest here
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.080]   because I work for a company that's building internet telephony
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.120]   and we really wanna make sure we can have that running
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.080]   on lots of different clients and servers as well,
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.320]   and do stuff server-side as well as client-side.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.640]   So clearly I care about stuff
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   not being closed down and locked up.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.560]   But I think that, yeah,
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.240]   that's because the open web is valuable in that way,
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.320]   in that it doesn't dictate what you can do with it.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.000]   And so in both cases here,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.120]   we've got Apple trying to dictate what you do with it
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.920]   through their process and AT&T to some extent,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.920]   trying to dictate what they can do with it too.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.760]   Google tends not to do so much of that
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.640]   because they were built on the open web to begin with.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.360]   They, you know, Google wouldn't exist
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.640]   if they couldn't have written a program
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.960]   that pretended to be a browser
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.000]   and did exactly the kind of thing
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.680]   Gene is doing now to Twitter.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.160]   Pull down information and made sense of it
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.640]   and then put more information up there.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.880]   So, you know, that's baked into the heart of how Google
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.000]   thinks about the web.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.040]   And it's not so close to the core of the other two companies.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   - Well, I've been reading while you've been talking
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.120]   but trying to skim through Steve's article
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.320]   and I don't, I don't understand either.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.840]   (both laughing)
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.640]   - I liked your explanation.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.080]   - That it was like, it's a, it's a,
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.320]   the whole group, Erington, Apple, and Google.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.160]   - It's all planned.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.080]   - It's all planned. - All plans to upgrade
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.560]   the carriers by, I don't know.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.400]   - I'm gonna buy it.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.800]   - It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.760]   Yeah, I was confused about that article.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.480]   - It was merely so well organized.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.880]   - Yeah, well, and especially Google Apple and AT&T.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.160]   - So, well, I might take my, I think what Steve was saying
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.280]   is Apple wants to be able to put their,
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.760]   their good client hardware on lots of different phone networks.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.200]   What they, and it's an expedient thing they did
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.840]   by doing exclusive with AT&D
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.880]   so they could actually get some concessions out of them.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.520]   There's that subject is definitely the letter as well.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.200]   Apple managed to negotiate the freedom to run apps
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.040]   on the network.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.280]   That was something they said.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.480]   That they get the veto over the apps, not the carrier.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.760]   That, they think that's really important.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.120]   - That's huge, yeah.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.280]   - And that is important.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.600]   You know, that was what stopped the,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.320]   the psychic being useful was that, you know,
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.600]   AT&T stopped them,
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.080]   stopped the app store being useful on the sidekick.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.240]   So, the, the psychic team went and built Android instead
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.640]   where there is, there's a truly open app store there.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.240]   So there's, there's, you know,
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.680]   there is a point there, there's,
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.400]   Apple opened up AT&T and then Steve's,
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.840]   what Steve is saying, I think, is,
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.640]   and Apple would really like to open up all the carriers
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.600]   and commoditize them and make the iPhone,
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.400]   the one true client that everyone gets.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.000]   And Google wants to make sure that that doesn't happen
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.400]   'cause they don't want to have to, you know,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.600]   sit there and have to ask Apple to be able
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.680]   to ship an application.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:24.080]   - I like Chris McSene's theory that Steve Jobs
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.520]   is trying to kill the app store
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.920]   'cause he always wanted to have to have apps all along.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   (laughing)
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.240]   - That's an conspiracy.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.880]   And just as likely if yes.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.000]   - So the way to think about Apple
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.440]   is that they're a hardware company.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.280]   So all this other stuff is like rounding errors to them.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.400]   This was the same thing about iTunes.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.240]   iTunes, you know, is really, really, really important
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.840]   to the music industry, the iTunes sales thing,
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.240]   but Apple basically passes through all the revenue to them.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.920]   They, when they launched the, the iTunes music buying stuff,
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.040]   if you bought an individual song,
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.320]   Apple lost money because they were carrying the cost
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.640]   of delivering it, they were carrying a credit card transaction
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.480]   for 99 cents, which you pay far too much charges on,
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.280]   and they were carrying the cost
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.240]   of the software and construction support.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.640]   But the bet they made was this will sell us
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.800]   a lot of little devices, and we can, you know,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.560]   and if you actually look at all the things they've done
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.960]   to sell things in bulk, to let you pre-pay,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.320]   to stuff like that, they're trying to sort of lay off
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.480]   the cost of buying an individual song with a credit card.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.280]   And the, what they did for the app store
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.440]   was basically the same deal for the developers
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.880]   that they did for the record companies,
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.920]   which is you get 70% of the revenue Apple keeps 30%.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.080]   They're doing less in terms of helping them digitize
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.600]   the audio and so on, which they didn't, and that side.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.920]   On the other hand, they're doing a more stringent review process.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.200]   So I'm not sure, you know, Apple isn't making huge amounts
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.360]   of money out of this process, but what they're doing is,
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.280]   is making sure that the little, the little shiny toys
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.560]   that they're selling people are much more valuable over time.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.240]   - Right, that's their goal.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   And since Kevin's the only person who has worked for Apple,
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.160]   Google and a major telecom company,
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.000]   I think we have to defer to you
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.680]   and your understanding of this.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.320]   But I think you're exactly right.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.720]   It's a hardware company, you can't forget that.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.560]   Ah, any other stories we have to talk about?
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.600]   All right, I'm gonna move on.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.520]   I'm gonna move on to Gina's tip of the week.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.240]   And now Gina, as you do this,
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.280]   I'm gonna try to follow along on the computer here.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.640]   - Oh, okay.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.760]   So this one requires like a few,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.520]   quite a few steps and restarting Firefox, but it's worth it.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.440]   - Okay, I'm gonna start Firefox.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.880]   That'll be my first step.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.760]   - Okay, okay.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.960]   So this tip is for people who live in Gmail
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.480]   and Google Reader every day.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.360]   So, you know, you open your browser every day,
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.400]   you open up Gmail, you open up Google Reader.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.800]   But if your type of person opens up lots of different tabs,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.760]   you wanna have those tabs kind of affixed to your tab bar,
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.960]   'cause you're always gonna have them open.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.440]   And also as small as possible,
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.120]   so that they don't take up tab bar real estate, okay?
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.320]   So there's a set of Firefox add-ons,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.120]   which I actually linked to from my blog,
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.440]   smartaware.org, it's right at the top of the page,
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:01.080]   that lets you reduce your Gmail and G-Reader tabs
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.840]   down to just the icon, put the number of unread items
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.240]   onto that icon, so it's still informative,
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.720]   and permanently affix them there.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.320]   So regardless of whether or not you hit close all tabs,
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:14.360]   or you close your browser entirely, or start a new session,
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.560]   they're basically permanent icon only Gmail and G-Reader tabs
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.720]   that show you how many items that you have unread.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.560]   For folks who wanna have a regular homepage,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.480]   but also kinda live in those two web apps.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.560]   So that's not very easy to follow along with.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.960]   - No, you know what I'm also learning,
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.640]   I didn't know you could create collections of add-ons.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.800]   - Oh yeah, Mozilla just launched this a few months ago,
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.400]   you can create collections of add-ons,
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.680]   and then you can subscribe to collections,
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   so that if the person adds add-ons to them
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.400]   or removes them that they update in your browser,
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.920]   which is also kinda cool, but it's an easy way
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.640]   to link to a set of add-ons.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.840]   - Right, oh and they get updated as well.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.000]   - And they get updated as well, so the add-ons
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.560]   that this works with is a faviconize tab,
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.280]   is what it's called, which means that the tab
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.120]   is just the favicon, not the text, right,
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.480]   which makes it real skinny.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   Another add-on called Perma tabs,
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.120]   which keeps certain tabs that you specify open
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.400]   at all times, it affixes them regardless of your session state.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.360]   And then this is shameless self promotion
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:23.200]   to add-ons that I developed, that I compiled,
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.720]   better Gmail and better G-Reader,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.600]   which include the number of unread items in the favicon.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.880]   - And you have to have a Mozilla account
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.840]   to take advantage of this.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.360]   - Actually, no, you can install the add-ons without
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.440]   to try to make a collection.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.240]   - I don't have the log on, okay.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.760]   - You can just click on each one of those add-ons
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.080]   and install them by one, and get it configured.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.200]   But the instruction is done, how to configure it,
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.800]   and what you have to set up in the add-ons are on my blog,
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.600]   which will also be in the show notes,
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.440]   the link to that post will be in the show notes.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.560]   - Right at the top, smartawear.com.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.120]   You said .com.org.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:56.960]   - That org.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.960]   - .org, okay.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.000]   - Yep, .org.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.400]   - And thank you for including a little twit tab in there,
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.240]   that's very nice.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.920]   - Oh, of course, I've always got the twit tab up.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.000]   Come on, who does it?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.080]   I'm gonna perm a tab that one.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.880]   - It's better twit, I wanna see that soon.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.960]   Our number of the week comes to us for Mr. Jeffrey Jovis.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.760]   - So the number this week is 420, that's 420%,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.720]   which is how much Google stock has increased
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.080]   in the five years since its IPO.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.160]   - It was five years ago yesterday, that's right.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.000]   - Exactly.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.960]   - Five years, so what's $85 to $445?
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.720]   Mind you, I bought it at 512, so never fall
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.800]   as five different for me.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.320]   (laughing)
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.480]   He's still waiting for it to come back any day now.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.200]   - At the same time that Google went up
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.640]   420% the NASDAQ, get ready, get your heckered chips out,
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.600]   is up 8%.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.880]   - Oh, wow.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.200]   - But Goldman Sachs just issued a good report on Google
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.520]   and put a target price on 560
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.320]   versus the present 445.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.160]   - You might.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.680]   - So 420, that's the number of the week.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.520]   - 512 is where Jeff is.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.780]   (laughing)
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.000]   I own no Google stock, I would say that right up front.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:07.840]   - Me neither.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.680]   - Yeah.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.560]   - The tool of the week is something that I don't actually use
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.320]   because while I have an Android phone,
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.240]   I'm not a big Android user, but I'm sure Gina would like this.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.400]   It's called Google Listen.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.800]   Did you see this?
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.640]   This is a podcatcher.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.320]   Now I didn't realize this, I was reading Kevin
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.360]   your biography and I didn't realize how involved you were
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.840]   in the early days of iPodder and podcasting.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.960]   - Yeah, no, that's, I think I was the,
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   did the first demo of downloading a podcast
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.880]   onto an actual iPod, I did that at the first BloggerCon
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.920]   and there's video of that up.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.640]   So, and it was like Gina's tool,
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.480]   it was this horrible command line thing that you ran
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.920]   and it would go and pull stuff and then stuff it into iTunes,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.560]   any of it's plug iTunes into sync it.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   - But it worked, I couldn't understand it at all.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.800]   - You tried it?
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   - You was in it.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.760]   - I didn't know anyone was talking about it.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.600]   (laughing)
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.080]   - But fortunately Apple then did it and made it work.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.160]   So that was good.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.400]   But yeah, I'm excited about that
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.160]   because I've got the Android, the trouble is the Android
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.600]   doesn't have a phone out, an audio out jack.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.800]   It's only got a USB, which is--
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   - It's of course.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.280]   - Massive sub setting, I know.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.240]   - And it's a big design.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.080]   So.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.160]   - In fact, the G2 doesn't even have a standard jack.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.640]   - Oh, ah.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.440]   - I think the tour does though, does the tour?
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.280]   I think the newest one is supposed to.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.880]   - So we have to go like Liam, go all digital for our audio,
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.720]   which is--
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.280]   - Yeah, anyway, Google listen, it's in the marketplace
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.920]   and you can download it and I did download it and install it
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.760]   and I have to say, it works well,
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.560]   it does exactly what you would expect it to do.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.400]   It has a little play button down here.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.960]   You can subscribe, you have a listen queue,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.200]   you have a subscription queue, you have searches
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.640]   and this is kind of interesting
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.120]   and I'd like to sure get on this list,
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.000]   the popular searches list, which is really kind of
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.600]   like Twitter trends.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.040]   I mean, it's very timely.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.720]   You know, you've got Hurricane on here, Quentin Tarantino,
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.960]   GDGT, I don't know exactly how PS3 slim.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.840]   So I guess they're somehow looking at maybe show notes
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.520]   or tags or something and seeing what people at Brett Favre.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.240]   I mean, do you, do I get the Brett Favre podcast?
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.600]   I don't know, I get, no, I get a bunch of podcasts
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.160]   that I guess refer to Favre.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.320]   So this is a way to follow, this is actually
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.920]   a very interesting use of podcasts
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.960]   that I hadn't really anticipated
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.200]   to follow trending topics by listening to audio.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.080]   So I think they've done a nice job.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.720]   This is the, and of course this week in Google
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.160]   can be found and listened to with this new Android listen
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.280]   that's available in the marketplace and you can download it.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.560]   It's absolutely free.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.280]   And if you turn it up real loud, you don't need a heads phone.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.000]   You'll just irritate everyone around you.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.800]   Just bug everybody on the subway.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.760]   Now this is a time, and I would like you,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   if you want Kevin to pitch in where we whine.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.200]   This is the time of the show where we whine.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.560]   We complain, we bitch and moan about things
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.600]   that aren't being done better.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.320]   And actually you, I think you pinpointed one already.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.120]   Where's my three and a quarter inch jack?
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.560]   Or whatever it is, three millimeter jack.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.560]   Yeah, what do you, Android makers out there in China,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.840]   put a three quarter, it's built jack on there.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.760]   We want one of those two.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.400]   Yes.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.040]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.000]   Gina, do you have a complaint?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.560]   I have a little wish list item.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.280]   I was talking to Merlin Mann actually this week.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.640]   And Leo, you and I have complained about this together
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.440]   before, Gmail filters.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.840]   I would like an easy way to say like add the person
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.800]   who sent me this email to this particular filter.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.840]   There was a grease monkey script that sort of kind of did it,
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.040]   but it doesn't work anymore.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   I want Google to be able to manage our filters a little
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.480]   better and just say, you know, when this annoying PR person
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.760]   sends me another unsolicited press release,
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.080]   let me just add them to my, you know, black hole filter,
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.280]   one click.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.680]   You know, to be honest, it's the reason I don't use Gmail.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.600]   I think that they thought originally that threading
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.680]   and tagging would be sufficient, but I've got to have filters.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.800]   I really have to have filters.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.280]   And I have a very extensive list of filters.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.640]   I use, I have fast mailism.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   I'm a I'm at provider and I use, they have a civ scripting
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.000]   language that is more powerful than any filtering tool.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And it's really good.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.520]   And I use it like crazy.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.080]   And I just don't know how anybody can use an email package
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.600]   that doesn't put things in folders.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.360]   It just...
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.520]   Because the search actually works.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.120]   That's the difference.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.000]   I use search.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.240]   I know, you know, this is a, this, there's a philosoph.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.720]   There's two groups in the world.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.040]   People who think they need hierarchy and people who think
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.240]   search eliminates the need for hierarchy.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.760]   Can't we have both, Kevin?
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.200]   Why do we have to have one of the other?
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200]   You can have both.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   Yeah, yeah, of course you can have both.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.880]   But, you know, the point is what I, what I, what I moved
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.920]   from Apple Mail to, to Gmail was that it was slower to search
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.080]   my own computer than to have Google do it in the data center,
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.480]   which is kind of weird, but I guess they're good at it, you know.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.920]   And, you know, that's because I had that much, that much email.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.120]   But the other half of this is, you know, when beginners give me
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.440]   a tip just then, this is, this is my point about flow again.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.640]   I did really don't want unread counts sitting there and nagging
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]   me all the time.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.320]   I'd, I'd, I'd rather have stuff come by and if it's important
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   to come by again.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.040]   And I've started treating email that way as well.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.240]   So if I don't just want your emails, it may just be that--
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.080]   It's just in catch or attention at the time.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.920]   Kevin confessed my, my secret sin, not even doing the same thing.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.680]   You know what we need?
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.320]   We need a like button on email.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.760]   Well, we have a star.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.160]   We have a star.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.560]   But you have a tactic like--
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.720]   I read it, but I just didn't write you back.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.440]   Like I need an acknowledgement.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.280]   I have a--
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.560]   A static email button, yeah.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.520]   I have a new, new bad habit where I flag emails that I should
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.400]   respond to and then I can leave them in a folder and ignore
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.560]   them even more easily.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.360]   Right, because you have acknowledged them in your own mind.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.480]   I've flagged them in my mind.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   Yes.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480]   I'm now I can ignore them.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   It's just like anything sun problem, right?
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.560]   Like anything sun problem is you write things down the list
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.600]   so they're not in your head.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.160]   But then they're in the list and they're not in my head
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.360]   and then I lose the list.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.280]   And it's great.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.120]   Life is easy.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:06:59.920]   I think so, Gina.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.400]   It was more than just putting in folders.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.720]   You want actions as well.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.640]   And that's really what filtering is about is actions.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.920]   Right, not just filtering.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.080]   Well, I mean, they have filters and they do have actions.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.520]   I mean, you can say if this person writes, then send them
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.360]   this can response.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.080]   The existing filters are decent.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.840]   I mean, there are some things that it can't do,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.920]   but they're decent.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.000]   I want an easy way to append people to a filter.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.480]   I want an easy way to say--
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.240]   I see what you're saying.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.920]   I've got an email from someone who I don't want to hear from
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.840]   anymore or I always want to send to a label.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.040]   And I just want to be able to one click, say, here, add them
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.400]   to this filter I have already set up for mailing list.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.040]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:35.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.200]   I misunderstood.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.960]   Yeah, that would be very handy.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.680]   Because the filters are pretty good.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.120]   If you add too many people to a filter,
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.440]   I've got this giant filter of PR people and the more.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.520]   And it's up to 200 addresses.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.320]   And Gmail just kind of falls down.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.200]   Like if I'd probably re-save it, edit it and re-save it,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.160]   Gmail just says working, trying again, working, and spins.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.240]   But just easier filter management or maybe more
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.800]   advanced filtering.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.320]   This is really the solution is I never forget that Apple,
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.520]   that silly Apple knowledge navigator video that they made.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.520]   I want a computer that's smart enough to kind of know
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.640]   what to do with email.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.040]   But that's been the myth for the last 30 years.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.720]   That was it.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.600]   Patty Mays was working on that at MIT.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.720]   God knows how long ago.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.840]   And the problem is that's the hard problem.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.000]   That's a really hard Turing test is like, which stuff
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.760]   should I actually care about?
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.000]   And the answer that is, well, what do other people care about
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.160]   that you've realized?
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.640]   That's the answer that we've come up with.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.680]   It's like, OK, which news should I read?
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.880]   I'm not going to delegate it to them.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.600]   I'm going to have a lot of sources and see what comes up out
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.720]   of it.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.600]   And email is naturally causes you trouble because anyone
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.480]   can send you.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.040]   Whereas all the--
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.480]   sort of for saying that word by my son.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:55.960]   But see--
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.120]   I'm going to bloop it so you can make
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.720]   him listen to the podcast afterwards,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.880]   and then it'll be better.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.360]   But that's the piece that we have
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.480]   been solving with the social networks with Twitter.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.800]   And these things, like, I get to choose who gets to send me
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.200]   stuff.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.720]   And therefore, there's a better chance
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.240]   of being stuff I'm interested in.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.280]   And you need some leakage.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.600]   You need some of it as you see things
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.080]   that you haven't--
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.080]   Yes, serendipity.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.040]   So that.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.600]   But you get that by following other people's opinions
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.200]   and giving them some way to reply to you
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.840]   with filtering.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.920]   The problem is I'm the only one who gets my email.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.720]   But the system doesn't even-- what necessarily
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.520]   what you will.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.600]   What Marissa was saying this week at Aspen was,
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.480]   if you followed the story, you should get updates
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.040]   to the story to tell you that there's
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.000]   been a correction or there's something new.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.720]   And you have to go find it all the time, which is rather absurd.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.560]   So something just needs to be able to listen to you better.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.360]   And try and do better than Amazon does.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.920]   Well, Amazon has a really good signal
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.040]   because they have you actually paying the money.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:54.960]   That's a very strong signal.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.920]   It's like, I did actually buy this book here.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.480]   So therefore, you might like this one next to it.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.400]   Whereas, if it-- that's a much stronger signal
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.960]   than I just happened to click on that email
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.240]   rather than the other one.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.960]   And the challenge is they haven't done that much,
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.240]   even with that really strong signal.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.640]   They still tend to give you these sort of mass market things
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.720]   that everyone buys and things like that.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.920]   Because the real value is finding a set of other people
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.240]   that you want to fill the things for you.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.440]   And each of you is choosing different sets of those
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.360]   rather than trying to do the global--
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.280]   the global watches the most important answer
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   for this result, doing different kinds of local personal,
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.040]   what's the right answer for this question?
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.320]   Gina, I understand the Google Labs
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.120]   is working on a screw you button.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.320]   Really?
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:39.920]   Are they?
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   No.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   It goes to Microsoft.com.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.800]   Custom Microsoft.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.720]   Yeah, along with the goggles.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.760]   But the goggles.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.640]   To go back to the search versus folders debate,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.920]   I call it the filers versus the pilers.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920]   I like that.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.320]   I am evolving from a filer to a pilot.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.520]   No judgment.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.320]   What's better, of course.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.600]   But I'm getting more into being a--
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.560]   searching my pile.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.360]   But I still filter things in a labels Leo.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.440]   So I'm still with you on that.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.320]   I just would like both, OK?
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:12.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.200]   I think that's reasonable, totally.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.280]   There's no reason why I should have one or the other.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.080]   I should be able to do both.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:18.720]   Yeah, of course.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.320]   But also, I mean, the other thing is that it's
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.680]   the same problem of it works when you distribute it.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.600]   If you let other people see the results of your tagging
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.840]   and labeling, then that's creating information.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.800]   And that's useful.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.040]   So that you get a flicker or a delicious,
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.920]   rather than iPhoto, where I have all these photos.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.720]   I haven't bothered a tag, as opposed to flicker,
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.000]   where everyone's been able to tag photos for me.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.920]   So that becomes more useful.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.120]   And that's one thing that Wave does have, actually,
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.880]   buried in there somewhere, is the ability for anyone
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.360]   to tag the different pieces in there and label it,
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.840]   and those propagate through.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.520]   So that piece is-- that's one thing
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.360]   that Google has done in Wave that I
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.000]   haven't seen in other parts of the system.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.480]   And obviously, you need to be careful about this,
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.520]   because the way you tag email is very, very relevant to you.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.120]   And if Gina is tagging the PR person with Bozo,
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.200]   she doesn't want that propagating back to them.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.040]   But--
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.360]   I don't.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.200]   Well, you're mine.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.720]   I might.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   Like, when Leo smiles, I'm trying to get him to screw you.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.640]   It's for you, label.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.960]   And Leo's a count.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.880]   That's what I want to see.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:30.600]   Any other wines, moans, complaints--
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.640]   this is actually a fun part of the show,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   because I just wanted my Google Wave invite.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.120]   Yeah, we still wanted it.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.520]   I thought this was a wish list, which
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.560]   is a little more hopeful than the complaining,
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.240]   whining, complaining.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.200]   Well, Merlin Mann would call it the wines,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.000]   but you're so positive, Gina Perpani.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.160]   We'll call it our wish list.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.000]   Our hearts will hold.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.560]   In that case, I want paparotia, my pizza.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:54.920]   Yeah, that's not a wine.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.200]   That's a wish.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.680]   I understand completely.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.000]   Kevin Marks is so glad that you could join us today.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.120]   Kevin's blog is-- well, the easiest thing
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.840]   go to KevinMarkz.com, and then he
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.280]   links to various things.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.760]   Is that what you would prefer people do than to go to--
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   I need--
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.120]   --appiest to pick any.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.680]   If you search for Kevin Marks on Google,
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   I'm the top result.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.600]   Well, I'm the top page, but the top result is my blog.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.560]   And that works.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.080]   There you go.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.280]   Google, Kevin Marks.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:19.760]   That was easy.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.720]   KevinMarkz.com, I need to update a bit,
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.160]   because I haven't really touched that.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.960]   It's the usual problem of the--
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   Right.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.560]   --the published children's shoes.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.800]   Well, I thought it was funny that KevinMarkz.com, which
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.080]   would normally be your hub, is really just a Google
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.280]   friend connect demo more than anything else.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.800]   That's what I started using it for.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.840]   Is it-- oh, yeah, but friend connect.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.680]   Yeah, I started playing with that.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.240]   That's true.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.360]   I don't tend to use it.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.220]   The blog is the place that people link to with the words
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:48.840]   Kevin Marks on.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.760]   So that's the place that's been me since I started in 2001.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.280]   So that's the place where most of my stuff ends up
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.880]   one way or another.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.160]   The only negative-- and I'm just going to point it out--
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.200]   is that if I say go to Kevin's blog,
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.160]   the happiest of Piggany to blogspot.com.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.560]   P-E-P-E-U-S.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.640]   What does it pay us mean?
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.280]   It was the guy-- the engineer who actually
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.200]   built the Trojan horse.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.640]   See, everybody should know that.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.400]   That's so Kevin.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.160]   At the time I started, I was this anonymous engineer
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.120]   inside Apple building interesting stuff,
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.920]   and nobody knew who I was.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.040]   So you were the guy.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.840]   That was where that came from.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.760]   In a Piggany, what does that mean?
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.120]   That means someone who copies them.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.440]   It's an emulator.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.600]   And it was at the time you make up an alias,
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.440]   you think, oh, I'm going to do this anonymous blog thing.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.240]   And after about a month, I thought, no,
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.680]   I need to put my name on this.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.520]   And I put my name on it.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.320]   And now, if you search for me, that's what you find.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.120]   Good.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.520]   Which is fine.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.200]   That's it.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.280]   Right there.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.240]   Go there.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.320]   Buzzmachine.com.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.440]   Now that, I know what it means.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.240]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.600]   Jeff, thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.920]   We'll see you next week.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.480]   Gina Tarpani is at smarterware.org.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.520]   Everybody go to GitHub and download Twitterlytics.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.800]   Ah, thank you, Leo.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.280]   I can't wait to-- I'm really excited.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.640]   I can't wait to try it.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.000]   I'm scared it's not going to work for you.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   But you know, you, I want to want to support you, Leo.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.680]   It'll work.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.480]   It'll work.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.320]   I like messing around with my server.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.560]   But the thing is, when I put stuff like that on my server,
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.000]   I always put it on the Twitch server, the big production
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.080]   server, and bring it down.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.480]   And then everybody gets mad at me.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.920]   Everybody gets mad.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.880]   What did you do?
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.760]   Oh, I just-- I don't know.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.200]   I put some random code on there.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.600]   Is that a problem?
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.720]   I just ran a cron job every 15 seconds.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.960]   Isn't that what Gina said to do?
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.800]   Be sure to read all the disclaimers and the read me, Leo.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.960]   Yes, I will.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.440]   I will.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:38.920]   Please.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.880]   You think I'm joking, but my sys admins know I'm not.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.760]   This is exactly the kind of thing I do.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.880]   Did I give you root?
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   That was the problem.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.240]   Give me root.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.040]   I started with root.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.560]   I gave them root.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.040]   They said, can't we-- can you-- can you-- let's use a pseudo
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.200]   or his file, and you could be a pseudo or not a root.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:55.920]   No.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.760]   And you were like, nope, root.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.840]   Not only that, I've got SSH automatically logging in to root.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.160]   So I just-- I just says SSH right in there.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160]   Oh, man.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:05.680]   Ah.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.280]   With great power, Leo.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.280]   With great power.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.000]   It's my server.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.800]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.640]   It's great to see you.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.880]   Great to have you listening.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.240]   Make sure you listen.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.160]   When we do the show live, it's always fun to watch.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.040]   We now-- we've moved the time to 5.15 Eastern time,
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.040]   215 Pacific on Saturday afternoons at live.twit.tv.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.760]   But of course, you can use--
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.080]   I wonder if there's any of Kevin Mark's code still in iTunes.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:32.920]   You can down.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.040]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.400]   Little iPodder in there.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.360]   Just little--
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.520]   I never worked on iTunes.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.360]   I doubt there's any code in iTunes.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.720]   Did you write it in Python or Shell?
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.560]   What did you write it in?
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.120]   I read it in Python.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.280]   I thought it was my own machine.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.480]   And I probably haven't got the code anymore for that thing.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.240]   There's still-- probably still some of my code out there
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.320]   in quick time.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.160]   There you go.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.640]   I'm sure there is on that.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.960]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.260]   (upbeat music)
