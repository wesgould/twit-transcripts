[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.360]   Really pretty much anything having to do with the modern internet world media
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   Facebook Twitter Google of course
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.400]   You don't have to tell me twice we can talk about anything you want just name it
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.160]   Did you hear that?
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   Yeah, what was that it's a ray telling me you don't have to tell me twice we could talk about anything you want
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.920]   That sounds sassy
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   The first time anybody's responded to the show open like that
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.160]   Most of the time they say you should talk Marmok Google and even Google doesn't care nowadays
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.720]   Let me turn off a serray and I met I missed John legend that was nice, but
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.200]   Now I've got this array in my in my phone that is Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York at the town
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Night schools great to have you
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   Stacy Higginbotham on the left. She is of course the host of Stacy on IOT the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofol Stacy on IOT
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   com for her newsletter and
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.440]   The three of us make up the show aunt is because I don't want to overst I don't want to stress out the team
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.320]   So we're gonna just do the three of us for the time being we can bring it back
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.920]   Once everything settles in and if you watch the show and I know very few of you do most of you listen
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.200]   But you'll notice it's a little bit of a different set set up. We're changing how we record our show
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   How are you talking about Microsoft? I know this is the Windows weekly set up. I'm sorry
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.760]   I mean, I love taking it out with Mary Jo Foley, so I
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.280]   Yeah, isn't she great
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.220]   So we we do this is how we used to do it in the old days in the cottage
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.160]   I would sit here and we'd have Skype a source on a big screen behind me and I realized by doing that I can do
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.520]   The switching so we don't have to bring more engineers in studio
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.800]   That's one of the few jobs that can't be done work from home. Somebody has to be in here to
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.880]   Push the buttons and stuff so might as well just be me and for those who were recent to the show in the cottage Leo had
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   The switcher and the cameras and and the chat and everything there and it was amazing and it's just returning to I still do
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   Yeah, I don't have a big I used to have a little tea bar and everything and now it's all virtual on screen over here to my right
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.680]   But you'll get you'll see me when I'm doing the show occasionally look over here because I'm picking the next shot
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.200]   That kind of thing I just do it on a keyboard in a mouse over here
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.040]   Well Leo you are very good at picking or pushing buttons. I am the ultimate button pusher. That's exactly right
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   so
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.800]   Boy there's a lot to talk about lots of things
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.000]   Here's the interesting thing go ahead. Oh, I was like just to live up to the show
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.680]   Yeah, I owe which was initially they said well, we're gonna do it virtually. We'll stream it now
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   They say we're not even gonna do that
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   And I guess the reason is even to stream it you have to bring people together in a room and
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.920]   We have a facility where you could actually we could actually do it for them if they if they
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.400]   Offer if you did I all
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.880]   We you just we put the speaker in another room and I run the board and where they could sit here
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.320]   If you want to sit on my ball, it's it's here for you. So
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.760]   Said we're set up to do that but but if you think about it for a conference
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.840]   To do the seminars and all the things I don't know I think they could honestly I think they could do it
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.080]   I think they just what do you think that or was it the fear of no interest? Oh
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.920]   It'd be interest. Yeah, so I will say I
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.360]   am scheduled to do a virtual talk for a conference on in June and
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.200]   Figuring out logistics. They're like hey
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.360]   You know, do you want to go into a studio to do it?
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.220]   Do you want to do it from your home? And I'm still trying to figure out like this is obviously not the most professional
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.080]   Setting to do like an actual talk. Well, what that's the cool thing. We're all getting kind of used to that aren't we?
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.640]   Yeah
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.080]   But they they're like, you know, they want control over the production
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.960]   So then I would have to personally travel into a studio setting that they have to find oh
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   They need to give up on that look if I'm saying you can't see an end could do it. Why can't they exactly?
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.200]   Everybody on MSNBC is in there and it's more human. So I just I just I love it
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.560]   Twitter
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.480]   The New York Times had article in the text section saying that it was bad
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.920]   Etiquette for your kids and pets to show up on your conference call awful as I said before we went on
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.340]   You know a dog showed up on an MSNBC she's an MSNBC shot with Connie Schultz
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.360]   Sherrod Brown's wife. I thought it was great the dog went up to her lap is a little when it shut up the dog was wonderful
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   So your dog should be on your lap
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.720]   doing the conference tell them to get human I
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.200]   Think so I wouldn't want to give a speech with my dog in my lap
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   Doctor who with the cat was it was it?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.920]   million dollars
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.080]   Yes, that's that's the Mike Myers version, but you're thinking yeah
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.520]   It's not doctor who it's James
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.480]   Ernst Tavros blow filled I can see you doing a blow-filled
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.440]   Thing with the dog. I would like that Stacy. Oh
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.480]   My dog would bite my hand off after a certain point. She doesn't like that. He's like oh, I do not want to be on your lap
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.640]   It's unstable. It is interesting though to see mainstream media, which has always been kind of inauthentic and
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   Uncomfortable with authenticity have to deal with this and don't we I mean this is why podcasting why shows like this
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:52.280]   Succeeded initially is because suddenly those people will let their hair down and that you could see them in their normal environment
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.400]   I just did a segment for good morning America where Becky Worley my old friend asked me
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.600]   Okay, what's your advice I said well make your bed
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.280]   You don't have to dress up the set or anything like that
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.880]   You know I don't have to use a green screen, but but you know make your bed brush your hair
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.120]   But that's the beauty of this is authentic. Yeah plus I get to see what people's homes look like which I love
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.400]   I'm a you know, it's I'm a voyeur Michael Beshloss
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.200]   The presidential historian has the best I think it's must be his home taste in office of course
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   You don't like wood. Oh
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.800]   I was very impressed by Anderson Cooper's house. Of course. He has excellent taste and the money to the Vanderbilt
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.680]   He's a Vanderbilt. So it's no surprise at all that his house was gorgeous
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:48.040]   You know he was I think in his library or something. I think this is where I don't I think this is maybe the
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.640]   Secret blessing of all this to some stage. You're not really gonna follow their orders and go into a place
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.400]   Are you you're gonna you're just gonna hold tight? She has to do with their sponsor. They're paying here
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   You should gotta do what they say they are paying me
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.960]   I mean and I think they're trying to figure this out in June is far offs. We'll just see
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.520]   I mean I do want to give a compelling presentation
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.720]   I think it's hard to give a compelling presentation just like here
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.600]   I am trying to talk to you for 40 minutes, which is how long I'm supposed to talk to you use slides
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.720]   Do you use any AV tool? I use slides, but I also I'm very big on stage. I
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:32.440]   You're not that big. I just articulate. Oh, I talk to the audience. I really try to make it's I'm very
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.000]   I'm a speaker who likes to connect with the audience. So so you do it stand up you have a I mean
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.920]   We could help
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   We like yeah, we could help and and it's something I think it's so funny to watch
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.320]   Mainstream media grapple with issues that we solved 15 years ago. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, we just said yeah, we don't care
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.600]   Yeah, yeah, well, well some of it we've given up on clearly
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.840]   But I I like the idea of it being natural and real and you know, we see jeffin is library and stacey in her office and
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.480]   me and my Byzantine
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.800]   Doctor no layer
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   That's like a toy that's old-fashioned toy store or something. Yeah, it really is you can't still really your office, right?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   This is my real office. Yeah. Yeah
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.000]   This is where I live
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.160]   But I don't do that much in here because I don't I don't really have a job
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.040]   So the desk is clean
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   On this side if you were to see that side on the other hand is far from clean
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   Everything gets shoved over to that side
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   That's one thing that people can learn is that the like photography TV has hits a frame and you just control what's in the frame
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   Oh, here comes here comes a visitor
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.600]   Visitor from the east. Yeah
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.200]   We love seeing people's doggies
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.080]   Yeah, that's fine
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.400]   I brought that she was whining outside
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.480]   Yeah, no, it's fine. Just like you said jeff is something. Well, she go on your lap for a minute
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   Oh
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   You're wet underneath
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:23.360]   Sweet puppy who's a good dog. Oh, who's a good dog? Don't you honestly feel like this is
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   Healing in some way. Yeah, I think it is. I think you're right. I don't want to
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.120]   I mean look, this is great tragedy. Many will die many will sick be sick
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.880]   It's it's horrific for the people who are losing their jobs the economy is suffering
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   But I also I said this on the last shop. I'm going to get heat for it. I feel like
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's kind of forcing us to focus on stuff that really matters
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.880]   Instead of the triviality that all of us have been it's almost God's way of saying stop looking at your phones
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   For one minute to stop think about your neighbor pet your dog dammit
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.720]   Yeah
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.880]   And and to see all of these, you know, the thing I always hate about network news is intentionally distancing
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.600]   The whole thing about tv is and that's why they hate it when I did good morning america
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.080]   She said can you put the microphone down?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.120]   Oh, I mean, it's like no, I'm talking it while I did but it's like come on you guys
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.920]   Anyway, they didn't air because uh the coronavirus. I hear there's something going on
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.160]   So uh the layer it'll air in another time. I hope sometime
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.080]   Um google finally did get a covid 19 page up. Not the one the president
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.240]   Uh was touting

[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.400]   um

[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.360]   Yeah
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.040]   Uh coronavirus
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.880]   covid 19 get the latest information and it's just I click that button and it's just loading
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Well, that's one thing that is happening everywhere. We were talking about this uh earlier today
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.920]   Microsoft azure in europe is struggling
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.640]   YouTube and many of the streaming uh services have had to cut ban with
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.920]   Way down for that reason. I mean, it's really a um
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.800]   Uh, you know, this is unanticipated traffic
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.920]   Yeah, I have data. Would you like it data?
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.760]   Oh, yes
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.720]   All right. Hold on. I will get it to you. Here we go
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.480]   And here while you're while you're getting it and getting the hair out of your lipstick
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.240]   Here is this is the google's covid 19 information and resources
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   This is not the site that president trump was touting which was the testing the testing site
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.120]   Uh, that site is up also. It's from verily not google verily is google as alphabets health
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.000]   Uh branch and it's just for san of clarin san Mateo counties. It's not
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.880]   a national uh test site and it's talking about taking it uh nationally now
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.640]   But it's pointless
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.400]   because you can't get a test
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.840]   And you probably shouldn't get a test unless you are in a hospital today where we can all get tests test
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.480]   Isolate track. That is the only strategy is going to work test isolate track
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.160]   Right now. We're only isolated because that's all we have we we didn't invest in the tests
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.400]   We don't have the mechanisms to track
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.440]   um
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.720]   Germany the ferro lingial swabs are made in lombari, italy
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:08.160]   The masks are made in wuhan china. It's not just the tests. It's the protective gear you have to use to give the tests
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   Uh, of course if in a perfect world
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.000]   Everyone would have a test you could isolate it you could contain it
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.520]   But we're way beyond that point at this point at this point at this point. It you know, I asked my doctor early on
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.680]   Can I get a test? He says, what are you talking? Are you crazy? Basically said, what are you crazy? No, we don't know
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   Island if you're island then you ideally we would test absolutely everyone
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.680]   And then you then you isolate and track
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.440]   Of course the people who have it and that's the only way to really contain this and this is going to go in way eventually
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.160]   We come back out again. People are going to get it again eventually. I hope we do have that capability
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.440]   but
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.240]   It's more than just that having the tests available and if it's for google or anybody to put up a site saying
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.320]   Well, here's how you get a test is is silly because you can't there's
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.920]   I'm going to be a devil's advocate. I would actually like a test
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.880]   So I know if I'm one of the people who've had it
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.840]   And can then hopefully go back out without infecting people. Yes, of course
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.680]   Then you want a serum test Stacy. So that's a different test. Sorry, that's true
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.400]   As in a serum test. I would love enough tests that of course you could get tested on the regular
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   But there's not enough grip but right now because there's a limit such limitations on the stuff
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.320]   Uh, the tests are giving being given most appropriately to people who are sick
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.800]   And and that's uh, I don't know how that when that's going to change it. So making a site it would be foolish
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.440]   to make a site that says well
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.360]   You could get a test. Are you sick? Maybe a site that helps you
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.920]   Uh, diagnose if you're ill or what or not and there's quite a few in fact this google
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.600]   Page has some of that. We were talking earlier. I got one of those
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.840]   Smart thermometers are talking about a lot on the news the kintza health thermometer
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.000]   And it does it kind of does that it was originally in fact say you said your school district had that so
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.240]   Yeah, so I actually talked to the ceo. I did an interview with him back in 2015. He was he was on my podcast
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.720]   Um in the whole
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.520]   They used to give the thermometers the cheaper version they have two versions
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.400]   Right two schools they did it in austin with a couple schools and the idea was
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.120]   When parents took the temperature
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.520]   They could in the app like you're showing they would see like oh there's a lot of strep throat going around here's
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.280]   You know, so you could look at that and say hey a lot of other people have a fever
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:40.080]   Here's what it might be based on the reports back from other users. So it was like a crowd source
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.160]   It was like ways for illness
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.720]   And the guy actually has a great story. He was like he was either eccentric or mckenzie consultant
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.840]   Oh, that's but he ended up going to africa and he was frustrated because he was part of one of the clinton
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.920]   Uh, I can't remember if it was malaria or not. I was like a clinton maybe a ball
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.120]   I did yeah was a disease initiative and he realized that there was absolutely no way to track diseases
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.720]   And that's actually why he created this so you could get epidemi-epidemiological information
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.480]   Ahead of times so you could actually like remember when google came out with their flu data and we were all like
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.200]   Yeah, that's useful. And then the next year it turned out that it was not actually as accurate
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.440]   The temperature and thermometer was actually accurate. So
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.040]   That's why he did this and then
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.120]   All into tracking this he does sell or kinsa does sell
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.200]   The data that they're gathering on a wide scale. They sell it in aggregate to advertisers
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:50.800]   Oh advertisers. Oh, that's interesting advertisers based on zip code. And so what happens is you can say I want to advertise my
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:58.880]   My clorox wipes my snake oil whatever in the zip codes that are having problems right now
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.320]   So they do do that, but it is anonymous. That seems okay. Do you is is oh, absolutely
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.360]   The New York Times did a story a year and a half ago getting antsy about it. And of course you know what I said
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.520]   I did let me ask you this stop stop
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.040]   so
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.960]   What if think about like companies like facebook? What if I looked at this and I said, hmm
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.760]   I don't want to I want to charge higher insurance rates to people who are more more
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.560]   More sick who are ill or if not kinsa data, maybe it's a smart scale
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.720]   What if I want to charge what if I don't want to advertise jobs to people in these zip codes because I know they're less healthy
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.040]   So which is better law. You're right. That's a problem. But the you deal with that law
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.960]   Okay, and I just I want to bring that like sure
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.640]   It sounds totally innocuous when you're like, yeah, I would love to as clorox to be like, hey
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.040]   There's this massive wave of disease coming your way
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   Scrub up
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.760]   Yeah, I mean, so there's some uses and there would be some commercial uses that would be less than
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.400]   I'm putting you in bed. Minstors. That okay, jeff
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.520]   Well, i'm just a store but that's where you don't know
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.720]   Where should i put town should I put you in it's fine
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.640]   Okay, um, I'm in basking ridge. I can't have room for that. I barely have a fine bane bridge island
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   I'm just gonna put new jersey nj and then you know the problem with that w a and nj. Maybe i'll do that
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.240]   I'm I'm working on our lower thirds or attractive
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.960]   What was happening
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.000]   Stacy wah Stacy wah, that's the problem. Why was the problem
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.760]   Anyway, so germany
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   alone in date lines. Yeah
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.240]   germany is
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.760]   Uh, the Koch Institute, which is not the cocks of cokes of america
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.360]   Famous old scientist. So it's basically the cdc of germany. Yeah, they put out a call to hire 5,000
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.240]   uh containment scouts they call it
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.960]   But this is germany the land of dr. Shoots and privacy and uh-oh, right?
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.160]   Yeah, and and so they're there they had 10,000 applicants. They're gonna hire them and they're going to
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.560]   um when
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.240]   When they get to the point where they have enough testing and uh, you've said oh, yeah, yeah, I just got it
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.720]   And they say who all did you see in the last two weeks can tell everybody we're gonna call everybody
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.520]   That's down them. No, that's way down the road from well, no, it's now in some places
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   In places where they've contained it. It's it says this is where privacy gets the way too. So so in various offices now
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.240]   I'll make that anonymous
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.320]   uh, some people are are known to have tested positive or known to have had the symptoms not here and
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.040]   What they're doing is they're saying to people we can't tell you who because of privacy and hip at all that
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.440]   But if you want to get a test you've got to say who you were exposed to that had it
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.040]   But you don't know because they won't tell you who in the office. You don't know how close your exposure was
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.240]   There's a limit to privacy and we're reaching it and we're gonna have these debates right now
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.840]   So here's what I would like as part of this debate. I think
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.560]   That yes during a pandemic
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.240]   We need to have track and trace becomes incredibly important
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.040]   But yeah, and this is what I would love to see
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.840]   It needs to be of limited duration, right?
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.480]   And while I acknowledge that this data would be incredibly useful for study later on
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:30.720]   I think the study of that data should only go to public health agencies and universities and there should be an IRB component later to using it
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.920]   And companies should not get this data and keep it for themselves
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:43.360]   So google may want to use it and there may be a really compelling case because they could do better research because they have more money and funding and whatnot
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.840]   But they shouldn't have it
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.240]   And to use it you have to like pass stringent you have to really show
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.080]   Legitimate research interest, I guess would be the way
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.440]   Epidemiologists of all sorts are gonna want to see the tracking of how the disease goes
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   There's there's one we call
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.840]   Let's go back in time. Let's talk about typhoid mary
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:13.760]   It's a good thing that typhoid mary's privacy was not protected, right? So here this was a woman who was giving she was a cook
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   She was giving typhus to
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.080]   People in New York. I think it was New York City, right?
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.120]   And they call her typhoid mary because she was patient zero for a typhus epidemic
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.160]   It's important to isolate that person and
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.000]   I mean, does she have a privacy right in that case?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.440]   I guess she does for you shouldn't have her name in the newspaper
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.640]   But public health officials should absolutely know who she is
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.880]   And her employer should know. Yeah
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.000]   Well, is it? I mean, we're all typhoid mary now
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.080]   Well, yeah, no most of us don't know if we are not
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.160]   We don't have testing. I mean so
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:56.480]   Ideally, we'd have testing so we'd all be like, I'm a typhoid mary. Yeah, I will let's go to two new things here
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.360]   So so two questions because I'm in my in my twitter feed with all these epidemiologists
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.480]   I'm reading about the data that they want and how they want it and and it's fascinating
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.720]   so
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.160]   Two questions
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.360]   one
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.440]   I think it's singapore now has an app china obviously had apps
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.080]   Uh, he's really he's doing this now is real doing this. That's right
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.560]   So in the in the crisis
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.200]   How comfortable are we with having with being let's say required to have an app?
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.040]   um
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.840]   Uh, and you can see the negative side of this is
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.720]   Ooh, they have the disease, but the positive side is oh, they're certified to have the antigens
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.800]   They took the serum test and they're and they're
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.000]   They're they have um immunity and they can work
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.160]   Uh, but you're you're not want to certify that in some way
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.880]   Um, what are the laws around that that we need to craft so that we can have
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.640]   More freedom as a result of this data and more
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.400]   Helping for the data, but restricted its use
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   So we need to make sure that this data is I would limit the ways it can be used to discriminate against people so there are ways like
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   Being sick obviously if you're sick you should stay home, right? So there are countries that are using that to like
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.080]   Basically the china like green means you can go anywhere red means you can't right?
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.120]   The newest thing is the app says
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.640]   Uh knows who you've had come in to contact with
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:29.760]   Right and that in saying that you've come in in some ways it matters like in your office, maybe it matters
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.920]   I mean they're also using um
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.520]   It's a distance in israel. They're using it to notice
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.640]   Uh groups a lot of movement out of the house. They're they're using it to police work from home
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.160]   Um, and they're also looking for larger groups
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.120]   You can see the value of this from a public health point of view should we so you can do that
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.880]   The larger question is should individual liberties be put on hold during a health crisis
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   They can be temporarily
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:03.360]   So I think temporarily and i'm not talking like sunset after i'm talking about a very narrowly defined order that gets
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.000]   Reauthorized every 30 days
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.200]   Um, unlike the patriot act where we react at a 9/11 by uh rescinding rights
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:18.080]   Forever on perpetuity. Well, right it does it does expire, but it just keeps getting renewed a brief son a quick sunset
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.320]   The difference there is you could reasonably say well, there's still a terrorist threat. I'm not i'm not done. No state. She's still going
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   Sorry, but yes
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.360]   Before our eyes exactly so you have to define the steps that would say hey
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.680]   This is in effect as long as x percentage of the population is infected or until
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.160]   Vaccines or until like pick your
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:46.560]   A b and c clauses there you would also have to say that that data that is collected through these apps
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:52.960]   Goes into a lockbox that can only be accessed by people with the legitimate research interest
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.800]   um
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.440]   because certain terms of handling right and secure handling and
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.360]   That's what I would say and if you don't meet those good grief
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.200]   You don't get access to this data. So if the police are like and I would even stipulate that
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.400]   Like maybe crimes are happening in this time and maybe five months now for now
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.600]   The police are like hey, remember that rash of pandemic lutings. Let's go see who those people were
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.840]   This could not be used for that. I agree with that. All right. So here's another question
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.840]   I'll be net no I'll put up again
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.880]   What if the government gave absolutely everyone in the country a biometric bracelet
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:37.520]   And in a time like this required them to bear it. Well, the good news is you don't have to because we all have smartphones, but okay
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.000]   I'll stipulate
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   App um in singapore. I believe it may be singapore. It may be israel if you don't have your phone with you
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.880]   It tells on you so I think you could probably put it on your phone and have it
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.840]   Tattle on your behalf but biometric that we're also check your temperature. I'm wearing a
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.760]   We're oh two level. This is the aura ring. This was a sponsor for a long time
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.280]   This measure is sponsored long enough. I could get one. Yeah, they're awesome
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.800]   And it doesn't know there's a study right now. Did you know that I am in the study with ucsf
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.040]   Uh every day I get from ora a questionnaire to answer for the ucsf
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.240]   But besides measuring heart, you know the obvious stuff heart rate and exercise and stuff it measures temperature
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.680]   And it gives me so I I am taking my temperature just because I want an early warning sign
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.480]   But it will tell me is if I look at my aura, I can show you on my ora app. It will show my uh
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.840]   My temperature going up or going down and that's also part of overall readiness
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.160]   So I can look at my readiness and I could see my body temperature
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.520]   And if it starts and I by the way, I was wearing this I got sick
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.400]   I think last year and you can see as as the illness progresses your your temperature going up is your body
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.520]   Corrects right now. It's pretty it's holding pretty steady
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.440]   So this doesn't this shows not your absolute temperature, but the change in body temperature
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:05.600]   Day by day, which is oh I see. Oh, yeah, I'm interested. Yeah, so this is a whole now. I'm now wearing my oximeter every night to sleep
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.360]   Really is that for the a or well? No, well, it's for for it's for um
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.600]   Uh, what do you call it? Um, oh sleep sleep apnea. Yeah, it's about me
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.560]   So I've been diagnosed, but I don't believe the diagnosis
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.240]   fully and i'm trying to try to judge what it is and
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.320]   um
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.560]   Uh, but it's fascinating to watch the o2
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.640]   And and see what the Stacy you've got more data on this. I can't I can't find any good resource online
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.120]   It says what normal or expected is on this. You've talked about this before oh two
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   Yeah
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.600]   For your oxygen while sleeping looks below like oh
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.080]   Oh, well that it's they're looking at variations is what they're doing. They're looking at it's going down to the same thing as my temperature
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.160]   They're they want to 92
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:56.480]   92 is usually when they start going whoa, that's not enough. Um, I can send you off back
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.640]   I've got a sleep study results and I can share
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   Thank you. It's really interesting. COVID hit it at an interesting technological
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.240]   Momentous where we have we have all these biometric devices
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.320]   We uh, we have been working from home. We have the capability we have
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:20.480]   Teams and Skype and and and slack and it's really uh, and and we and thank goodness. We have Netflix and Amazon prime too
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.280]   It's really an interesting moment in time
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.640]   Uh, and I think it's very clear
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   That we've got a lot to think about and that's kind of I think this show is is ending up talking a lot about that
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.920]   I feel like that we have the opportunity
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.400]   You know tests are nice, but what but if you knew
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.800]   Fever if you know temperatures, you know, we wouldn't know what the diseases, but you'd see
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.000]   And this map does show abnormal eight or atypical
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.040]   Temperature increases. So if I click the atypical button on this, uh, you can see there's some hot spots here
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.320]   Like weld county, Colorado and much of florida
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.760]   Orta is unbelievable and look where it is. It's on the beach
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:10.080]   Right. Well, that's not much of a surprise right after spring break. You can also look at louisiana and you could see
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.280]   That you know, uh, there's gonna everybody's worried. There's gonna be problems there. Why Colorado?
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.000]   Um denver. I don't know
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.840]   Um
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.280]   I don't know
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:27.120]   So but that's what's maybe it's just a high perspective. See that's what's interesting is this is data that isn't
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.840]   Related to testing or even hospital. This is this is you know
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:39.440]   You could see this is kenza. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I mean it's any fevers. So that's right normal flu
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.840]   covid
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.040]   strep
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.000]   Right, but they also they know what's typical because they've been doing this for some time
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.640]   And they know it's typical
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.960]   So, you know
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.960]   Yeah, we are having a particularly bad flu season. So that's somewhat of the issue
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.240]   But what is the brown in california? It's good. It's normal. It's not uh
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.560]   Yeah, and so uh, they're always feverish in the west coast
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.120]   uh, it's actually uh
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.200]   Less illness in uh in our county and that to me. I feel like this is because in california
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   We sheltered in place early
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.000]   But I don't know. I mean i'm not a scientist. So I you know
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.520]   I don't know what how you interpreted but I think we have here go back to it for for new york versus new jersey
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.960]   That was interesting. Um, it's uh, you can you um, I could zoom in. I think zoom it. Yeah
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   And
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:42.880]   This is where not having a good geography there's queens, which is a hot spot and of course menhattan
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.240]   Um, here's hudson county new jersey
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.880]   Bergen county, but these are all three counties been our hot spot. Yeah, and so that's menhattan and so you could see
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.200]   menhattan is
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.320]   I'm in summer set county. Can you go west a little bit s6
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.520]   Little s more now down down. No note note right there summer set so it's a little bit of a spot. Yeah
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.200]   Yeah
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.240]   The illness trend decreased by 4.43 percent so you're high but it's
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.800]   It used to be worse used to be worse
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:21.440]   I think what you're seeing a little bit in this is this shelter in place stuff working, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.040]   I don't know I I mean look I I'll leave it to uh
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.160]   Somebody with better brains than me to interpret it, but I think what's interesting is that this exists
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.040]   Uh, it's been around for some years
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.440]   Uh, what if it is being driven by a bunch of people who are worried about covid coming in and taking their temperature when they feel bad
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.400]   That's fine
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.840]   Because no, I'm just saying the comps may be different because right
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.240]   Well, that's why you need to hear a lots of them. You have to have lots of them, right?
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.680]   But you also need we need laws that say you can't get fired because your temperature was high
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.640]   You can't lose your insurance because your temperature was high. We've got to protect people in those ways, right?
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:07.760]   Well, the challenge with that is people will continue to find new ways to infer and make insights from this data
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:14.320]   So do you write laws that try to get ahead of each one of those actions before or after they start like doing the
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.080]   database redlining for lack of a better term or do you
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   create
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:28.080]   Guard rails around how the data can be used in the first place. I think I fixed. I see you you build with principles
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:36.240]   Rather than trying to anticipate every possible use of the data or hold it you say there are principles and the principles are that you know
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.880]   I think the sickness
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.040]   should be um
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.920]   Freedom of keeping your job and not losing your assurance from illness should just be a principle and wherever the the threat comes from
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.480]   Then you're you're in better position because you set that principles matter of law
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.920]   Okay, I would also
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   I'll just read it
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.360]   I wrote about this
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.840]   Last week in i'm going to ask you to to highlight it because it ties to what we're talking about
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.040]   Um, and this is if you go to my site leo
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.240]   It's and now is the time to pill to connect a medical device framework
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.760]   The reason is because some people I really respect they wrote an article in nature
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.480]   And in that article they talk about creating a five level framework for remote monitoring
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.880]   Um, there's there's character. I love kinsa. Yeah, that's great. Uh
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.600]   I agree with you a hundred a hundred percent. I think that that is this is the opportunity
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.560]   Right now. I'm subscribing already. It's okay. I subscribe. I know
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.680]   I know andrew makes me keep it
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.720]   Scroll down just a little bit because part of this is they have a connected sensor facts
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:55.680]   Uh, so this would be something like a nutrition level. This would be something you would see on your device to know
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.640]   How valid it is and they're calling for so they're calling for five things
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.240]   So validation so are there peer-reviewed papers and clinical trials for each device saying hey
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.280]   They're measuring the right thing to like diagnose disease
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.280]   The next level of the framework is security practices. This is this device secure
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.960]   The next is data rights and governance. So who gets your data? Is that clear to people blah blah blah?
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.920]   The final two usability and utility this is important
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.560]   for like can like
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.280]   Somebody who's not technically savvy even use this right does your doctor need to be doing
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.960]   You know support calls and then price how does it?
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.240]   Price is really fun because depending on who pays for it the value really can
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.120]   Can go either way, right?
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   So you might have insurance companies interests ahead of a consumers interest in this case, but the point is like show people
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.960]   Exactly what this looks like. So you got this from an article in nature. Is this being proposed?
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.600]   so this is
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.480]   The fda on friday basically said
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.120]   That they're going to allow remote monitoring, but it has none of this in none of these safe gardens
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.360]   Yeah, this is and so it's a proposal by a group of people some of whom have worked for the fda
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:19.520]   Some of who are very good security experts very well respected. So this is a proposal
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.200]   The article is so long you guys. I know my article is long, but the nature article is incredibly long, but it's really
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   Excellent and it's how we should be thinking about this
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.280]   So I encourage people to weigh in on this because I think it's
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:39.440]   It's crucial. Oh, there it is. Ta-da. Yeah, I would really love to see this
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.160]   In fact, this makes so much sense. I feel like it's never gonna happen, but that's just so obvious, right? It's such a great idea
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.200]   Well, it's not just a great idea
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.600]   It's really necessary for us to build trust in this kind of system because you have a lot of people you're asking them to give data that is
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.160]   deeply personal. Yeah
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.200]   Yeah
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.360]   Jeff may have gone on the air talking about AFib, but if he didn't want to it's not like
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.840]   Right. He'd feel comfortable with that data
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.160]   Kind of labels on food
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.240]   Yeah, so much
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.640]   Makes perfect sense to have it on medical devices
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.320]   You know connected medical devices especially
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.240]   Can I also reopen last week my twitter list?
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:28.160]   Yes, which by the way twitter list. I recommended on the radio show. I said everybody should go to twitter.com/jeffjavas and
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:35.120]   Yay and subscribe that way through bad email through the UI. So it's now up to more than 500 experts
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.760]   And I'm finding it absolutely invaluable the other neat thing that happened in the last week is twitter came to me
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   and asked for help in getting scientists verified. Oh
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.160]   And so I've helped so far about a hundred of them
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.960]   um
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.160]   And and they're doing more and and because they've and of course some dorks have come to me and people out there
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.840]   Don't do this. Oh, hey, can you get me verified too? No, are you a scientist risking your life or doctor?
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.120]   um
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.960]   Smart
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.520]   I got people like hey, well I write about uh covid
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:18.320]   I'm an artist. I'm worried. I'm hopeful of this was a medium piece by a guy. I said well, uh, I grow I my job is uh, uh,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.880]   viral growth hacking
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.440]   You saw this viral growth hacking so I know a little bit about how virus is propagates
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.760]   So I'd like to spout off about covid
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:35.600]   And medium took that down did they good? They took it down so I wrote about this. I have a post about about expertise
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:44.000]   Uh, time for experts. That was the ultimate and just I have a quote and I have that full quote in that post. Okay, it's um, uh,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.120]   If you go to medium, it's there. Uh, that's right. We don't have
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.920]   Oh, I better somebody else to look this stuff up
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.400]   I can do it. Oh, sorry, Leo. I could do it, man. I'm doing it. I actually do it
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.480]   You don't know this but I actually do do it. That's why I'm sitting in front of that big computer
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.360]   Uh, our rtd doesn't do it most of the time. I usually am pulling up this stuff as we go. Yeah
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.160]   Yeah, uh, so yeah was a ridiculous quote from the guy. Let me see if we can find it real quickly
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.080]   um
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   Uh
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.040]   And and and and people went berserk, but they didn't look at berserk about the medium piece
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.760]   Medium took it down the new york times had a piece
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:24.320]   By a guy named davis who was saying oh, it's not that bad katrarian piece. We'll be okay different methods
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.720]   No, no, no, which even the president is now quoting and the experts in my feed
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:36.240]   Berserk about it. Oh, that's why you have that feed. Yeah, because this guy, um, where where which which article that
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:42.400]   Which article should be should just be if you go to medium slash chapter. I'm not a paying member of medium
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.640]   No, it shouldn't be it shouldn't be um
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.160]   So hold on
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   Um, maybe if I follow you
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:54.000]   So the experts I see it here it is five or experts that said yeah, so if you scroll down as a block quote
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   Uh with that quote in it, um
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.960]   Though I can also look at the facts here too, but the other one there's people here. I recommend
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.360]   heart oh geez
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Scroll you have
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.720]   I refuse to I refuse to pay five bucks for medium. I'm sorry. I just won't do it
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.160]   Um
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.760]   Yeah
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.880]   I pay a lot more for bloomberg and I play a lot more for other things, but I just won't I can't bring myself to pay for
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.040]   I just put the friendly leo. Oh no, it's not that's the wrong one. Hold on. Hold on. Don't worry about it
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.880]   All right. I got it up so I can read it. Um, that was the point
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.320]   Uh
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.840]   I was supposed to bring it up so you could read it that was the point
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   Well, you're always faster than I am
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   So this is this is what the growth hack guys. I'm quite experienced at understanding virality how things grow and data
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.400]   God in my vocation
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:50.880]   I'm most known for popularizing the quote growth hacking movement in silicon valley that specializes in driving rapid and viral adoption
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.160]   Of technology products. That's when I start reading is data
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.120]   I was focused here isn't treatment but numbers you don't need a special degree to understand what the data says it doesn't say
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.520]   Numbers are universal
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.160]   Eat me
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.960]   Um
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.760]   This guy was just awful medium took it down good
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.120]   So meanwhile the times has one that has similar contrarian things and yeah
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.880]   He used to be associated with Yale
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.040]   But he's a sugar shell
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.480]   And he's a member of the advisory board for the california walnut board
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.800]   That more walnuts
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.960]   The new york time to chose to give this major thing which now the president and others are quoting
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.360]   And so greg gun solvis who's a brilliant guy at yale who's really at yale
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.800]   Um
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.680]   gun solvis geo and salv yes look up his twitter
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:43.200]   He just went properly berserk on this and then on bret stevens who quoted the same thing and then on tom fridayman who quoted the two of them
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:50.640]   And you have what they call armchair epidemiologists that's right stacey. It's a hard word to say you stumbled before
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.560]   Um
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.120]   Who who just think that's numbers or I can look at these numbers too
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.160]   And epidemiologists are just bloody brilliant
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.120]   And they they have experience that matters and we don't listen to people like me people
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.880]   Listen to the scientists listen to the experts doctors
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.800]   Barologists
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.400]   People who know what they're talking about journalists don't we find experts
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.520]   Yeah, uh find the people who matter and and and
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.240]   We've got them out there now. They're talking directly to the public on on the web. It's a wonderful thing
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.720]   so one thing that this
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.040]   It shows is that this is this is water cooler conversation
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.400]   And we've always had this humans have always done this, you know, I talked to my buddy joe
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:39.040]   And he says and we and we look it's kind of like gossip. It's um, and it's how we deal with anxiety
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.680]   It's how we look for information and avoid
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.320]   Uh, we've always done this, but now we have these tools that can make water cooler conversation
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   Give it more weight because it's published online and then
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.000]   Unfortunately, we have a government where they embrace this
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.840]   They they also like us share water cooler conversation
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.000]   We expect them to have a higher standard, but they don't and uh, but I think it's a natural. It's human
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.960]   I mean we do it to some extent. We all oh, yeah, but now you can call on the experts
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   Now I can I can go on my list now
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.280]   And I can ask them a question and you explain that to me and they're busy trying to save lives and everything
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.920]   I don't want to get in their way, but they will take a moment to make sure they they want people to get this right
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.520]   Right the experts are there and they're easy to find yeah
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.080]   Um if you sign up for jeff's list and sign up for that was the whole point of that
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.400]   You need this thing that kind of floats down
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.120]   Andrew could help you and just says sign up for my list that would sign up for my list
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.800]   Let's all get you. I'll get you the boingy the boingy boing
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.720]   It's just a little you can also find all my posts all my posts are also on buzz machine
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:52.160]   Good. So I I put them over there. I don't have to pay five dollars to read buzz machine dot com buzz machine dot com
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.240]   Thank you. I believe it's in your lower
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.640]   Yes, I just got a
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.440]   Oh, there he goes. Yeah
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.760]   So there we go. So so the other day I went off my walk which i'm proud to do every day now
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.960]   I didn't today because I had too many damn calls when I went for a walk and i'm walking along
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.560]   And there's a guy looks about my age who goes zooming by on a uh, electro scooter
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.000]   Um, uh, and then he comes back
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.800]   And he says are you just nervous?
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:24.240]   And I said, yeah, and of course he's a fan nice. Um, you know
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.360]   Of the shows. Thank you. So george who works at audible
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.680]   Uh came back by we had a nice little chat six feet apart. Oh, that's great. Our part
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.240]   Um, but it's some and he's you know, we've lived a half mile from each other for
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.680]   God knows how many years all the time i've been on the show and we didn't know it until he came by because we're open up
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.760]   So this is what you were saying before there are
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   Uh things we should take advantage of in this weird time
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:53.280]   I should also steer you to a guy i've known for years vince resanella who is a
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.880]   virologist and actually hosts a really good podcast that is very timely right now
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.160]   This week in virology he named it kind of and maybe he even looks a little bit like the twig
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.320]   Well, that's okay vinson. I know each other he is Jason. Yeah
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.880]   Come on, man. No, it's great and it's a really useful
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:20.320]   Uh, so I don't know how well known this is I think a lot of twit fans know about it because it you know, it kind of
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:29.200]   Ran in parallel to a twit for a long time, but if that's all they're talking about i'm actually and I bet you stacey you are too
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.000]   fascinated now by viruses
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:40.960]   Uh, the viruses are very interesting little beasties, aren't they they are that when I that's one of the reasons why I wanted to be a genetic engineer
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.120]   I I love
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.200]   I never knew it organisms. Oh, yeah. Oh man
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:55.040]   Biology was my first love there is a a great video which uh, um, steve gibson recommended
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.280]   It's uh, it must be german because it's a it's a youtube video
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   that translates to nutshell
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.520]   And I highly recommend it on the coronavirus and its mechanism and it's pretty easy to understand
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:14.160]   Let me let me pull it up for you. I have it on my um, I have a whole vince russ. No. Yeah, I already I already have it on my list
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.080]   Yeah, he's there. He's there. He's yeah. He's a he's very good at the list. Yes. I have a uh, a whole page
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:26.000]   This is my my covet 19 pages including our temperatures my journal of the plague year
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.160]   Uh links and so forth
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   But here's this video
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.000]   um, whoa
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.200]   Yeah, I think you would I think you would like this. It's uh, I check it out. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's uh german
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.800]   Here let me go to the youtube page because I can see his uh, you would you would recognize this word jeff
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.040]   It's uh, it's curts curts gazakt
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:53.360]   In a nice maybe a former student of mine. This looks like the this looks like the style of a former student of mine. No kidding
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.880]   It's beautiful. He illustrates. That's cereal fasges. Yes. Yeah, and he talks about you know one of the reasons that coronavirus is so
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:07.760]   susceptible to soap and waters is it as like I think all viruses it has a lipid shell a fat shell
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.640]   Uh, and so that of course as you know, that's what soap does is it breaks down fat
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.400]   Uh, and so yeah, this is a really cute little video
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.320]   I think suitable for the whole family because it's so colorful
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:26.720]   But it's as far as I can tell very accurate scientifically and it uh, it's uh really well done. I think
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.040]   You see my favorite hand washing video the black goo on the on the
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.520]   On the gloves. Yeah, isn't that good. Yeah, that's the best. Yeah
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.440]   So but but i've yeah, i've gotten very interested in this whole thing
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.800]   And of course there is some some speculation
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:50.240]   Because what a virus does is it injects its rna into a host cell and gets and tricks the hostel into transcribing it
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   And making more of the virus
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.720]   Uh thinking it's reproducing itself
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:01.840]   There's some evidence that these that this this viral rna has something to do with our own evolution that that without it
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.400]   We might not have evolved
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:12.160]   Or it's certainly it's affected our own dna. So I think that's kind of there's it's a it's a more symbiotic relationship than one would think
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.440]   And uh, I find it fascinating. Yeah
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.960]   Not all viruses have lipid membranes. Okay. Thank you
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   And they call it. I didn't know this the corona virus the corona is the little spikes
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.560]   On the outside of the virus. That's why it flows the corona virus
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:32.400]   And that's how it uh, it takes a spike it goes into the cell and says here has some rna
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.440]   That's my that's my it's a crown. It's a crown with spikes
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.720]   Um, all right back to back to google
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.440]   Um
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.880]   According to dr. Morbius your dna is mostly endogenous retroviruses. So thank you very much
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.080]   Uh
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.680]   Amazon interesting what amazon's up to actually there's this is that larger story, which is
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.280]   Uh, and I you know how I like to bring up philosophical
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.000]   topics on this show
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.280]   Some have said that the tech industry is
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:16.960]   Taking advantage of this and uh, of course we know the doj is trying to take advantage of it as well
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.120]   Um
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:25.200]   That this is an opportunity for the tech industry to become even more powerful. I think it was an editorial in the new york times
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:33.280]   Even more powerful amazon's an apple bound in um, the alanica thing the alanica. Okay. Yeah, it could be
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.760]   at land. It's been doing some really good stuff on this
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.640]   Yeah, do you pay for them? I do
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.280]   Um, and they're put all their covid. I pray is them even though they all
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:48.160]   Outside the paywall all their covid stuff outside the paywall and that made me decide to subscribe to yeah
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.520]   A lot of people are doing that. I think the atlantic is spectacular. Yeah, julia kerry wong. It's in the guardian
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.920]   Uh, which also is putting it's uh, uh, all its covid stuff. Well, it's doesn't have a paywall
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.400]   Um, how the coronavirus has created a governance vacuum the tech giant
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:11.680]   Amazon is quickly filling. It's calling up. I love this lead. It's calling up a hundred thousand troops extending grants to small businesses
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   Prioritizing essential goods and cracking down on profiteers. No, not the us federal government amazon
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:22.160]   It's doing the things that a government might do
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:27.520]   Um, and it's not just amazon walmart's hiring a hundred fifty thousand new workers
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.320]   um
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.040]   What what she says is
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.560]   um
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.920]   It's less and less far-fetched to imagine the everything store becoming the only store
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:48.480]   So this is this is something i've been thinking about because i don't know about you guys but with amazon having delivery issues
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:53.040]   I just switched to target to buy some things that I needed. I'm not getting two-day shipping
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.200]   But I am getting my stuff. Let's see yeah amazon's prioritizing only essential
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:03.760]   So if you want to get uh, for instance, we couldn't order any cameras for hosts or headsets because they won't come till next month
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.240]   Yeah, but I ordered something on target that will get to me on the 30th
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:14.560]   So that's four or five days from now, um, which feels totally reasonable. Yeah, um, not so bad is it?
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.000]   I'm picking different retailers. So the
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.200]   For a long time. It's true. My gut response was oh, I need this. Let's go get it on amazon and i'm like, oh, I need this
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.680]   Oh, let's go find it on another show
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.120]   Are you worried that this will just increase the dominance of the tech giants?
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   Uh, and they will just take advantage of this or I for one welcome my new boards and masters
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.800]   I I think they're being smart. I think there's a couple things here. They're being smart to be like, oh, it's gonna
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.440]   Be a lot harder to hate us after we donate all our masks
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:56.240]   After we help but I do think that they're in a position to help
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:03.040]   They're also in a position to profit from this and I think smart business dictates that you would take these opportunities
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.080]   as does compassion and
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.200]   I do think the tech industry likes to consider itself
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.840]   Compassionate in ways that I don't think
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.200]   Exxon mobile dilutes itself into thinking it is
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.440]   so
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.960]   And they're losing money too. I mean, so so uh, there's a story in the rundown that that they're gonna
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:30.800]   That loses it on the right word 44 billion in ad revenue that just versus the growth they were going to have
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.320]   So let's be clear. It's not it's not like they're losing money
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.120]   But there but they're yeah, well, they're they're losing the opportunity cost they're losing an opportunity
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.680]   at the same time facebook is
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.640]   Up and for all those who think oh facebook
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.880]   Well, look where you need them now folks the traffic there is up 50 percent. Yeah, they
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.520]   People want to stay in touch. This is what this is for and it's they're they're keeping their nose above water
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   This is a fine and good thing
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.320]   But twitter but like stacey in this respect. I don't use facebook
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.360]   But I'm finding many other ways so it isn't it doesn't necessarily create a dominant
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.560]   Force just like you using target instead of amazon. I'm using face time or
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   Or what's well, what's app is what's app is? I was like I'm using what's happened
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.840]   I'm like
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.480]   Still facebook but no there are plenty of other options and I don't use any of the facebook tools and I don't feel less
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.640]   Any less connected
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.000]   Although can I tell you the like probably a week ago?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.920]   Andra and I were hiking and I was like dang it
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.000]   Everyone should probably get a portal and then the buzzfeed story about effort
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.640]   Yep, you should get a portal and the fact that they're sold out the facebook video portal
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.440]   Yes leo you could make bank
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:46.800]   Getting rid of your pork where's my portal? I have two of them. I think I let berg take them apart
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   Which means they're probably not
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.360]   very good shape
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.720]   So but the idea like when it came out
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.520]   I did think the portal has some really interesting hardware like the using the AI to follow people
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.920]   Automatically is really compelling. Yeah, but who now does that by the way, right?
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.200]   but
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.000]   So
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.200]   So I do I do with my daughter because she's on andra
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.680]   I face time with my mom because she's on an iPhone. I don't feel like I need a portal
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.560]   You don't like my father who's 94
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.880]   Who who basically doesn't use a computer at all would never use a smartphone
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   What's the best way for me to get a
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.520]   Send him a
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.480]   Google display or a google display. Yeah, next nest home hub max would be fine too
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.520]   Either one of those and can I set it up here for him entirely beforehand?
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:41.360]   No, because it's got to have a wifi. He's got a well. I can put it. I know his wifi password
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.880]   No, it won't do it unless you're on that network. You have to go to his house
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.000]   I can't change my wifi. His wifi
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.880]   Yeah, I was gonna say so this sometimes clever
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.320]   Get or I did this actually to get into my Tesla once
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.720]   It didn't work
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.320]   theoretically it could
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.960]   Change your ssid on your phone to his home ssid
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:09.040]   Right and then change the password on your phone use your phone as a hot spot set it up as yeah, right?
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:09.840]   Yes
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.880]   Oh, that would work and so then I could just nail it to him and it would just plug yeah plug in join his network
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.440]   You'd have to hate have to have a gmail account
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.640]   So you'll have to set up a gmail account for him, but then you call him via his gmail account same thing within a caveat
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:30.320]   The caveat I will give you is do that the last step because I know that if I have left my google thing unplugged from a wifi network for
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:36.080]   A long time and that was like two weeks. I think it was it did want me to reset it up
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.360]   But I don't know how long that is
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.640]   PS chop says it goes by MAC address. I don't think you're right PS chops because
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.960]   I routinely
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.320]   Change routers. I'm trying different brands of of routers
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.960]   I always give them the same name, which is why my orbi is now named plume
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.160]   because because it's always plume and
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.320]   Even though it's not a physical plume and it doesn't it everything says oh yeah
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.760]   We're on the same wifi as long as the ssid and password are the same. I don't think it's looking at MAC address
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.040]   I know none of my dress. I did that's it didn't work. Okay, so it didn't work
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.440]   My echo all my echo devices and my google home devices will just
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.720]   Kindly join them the network regardless of what actual device
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.000]   Oh
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.080]   Sorry, my June haven't just got an update that I asked for I don't think they did it because I asked for it
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.960]   But I'm very excited my thermo max would if I would turn it on but I'm too scared to use it so
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.880]   Darn it Leo get on it
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.760]   I keep thinking oh, this is the perfect time. I'm stuck at home. I should watch all those videos
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.440]   Let's take a break
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:55.680]   Before Stacy hits me, you know, you can't hit me in this office actually you're a little closer. You probably could
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.400]   Just give me a his shot. I was like I could sneeze on you. I too
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.600]   runway
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.960]   Thanks a lot
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.360]   Well, I'm more with Stacy and Jeff and just a bit but our first word from our sponsor
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.520]   I showed a day brought to you by worldwide technology. It was actually
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.880]   Worldwide technology as a soft spot in my heart. It was the last time I got on an airplane for some time
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:29.680]   We flew out to st. Louis a couple of weeks ago to see their advanced technology center. I was blown away
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   So many people know wwt. It's an enterprise
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.080]   You know consultant supplier for enterprise hardware and software and it has been around
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.160]   For more than a decade
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.320]   Lot of customers have been with them ever since the beginning because they're just fantastic
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.760]   But over the last few years they have put together something that is like no other
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:55.920]   Testing and research center in the world. They are advanced technology center. They started at 10 years ago
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.800]   half a billion dollars in equipment
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:05.680]   Hundreds of OEMs and key partners ranging from the big guys the high tech heavyweights like Cisco and VMware
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.880]   to AI disruptors like Nvidia
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:15.200]   They have some amazing stuff from Nvidia in there. It's really really cool. They're deep learning workshop
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:20.000]   I'll get to that in a second. So wwt trusted partner been with you over the years
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.880]   They set the atc up initially so that their engineers could spin up
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.080]   Proofs of concept or pilot projects for customers
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.880]   This atc is where there's and I met a bunch of engineers a very number of people came up to me
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:38.880]   Said leo i'm doing this because of you. I used to watch you on the screen savers or whatever and I just I feel like I was at home
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.320]   It was really really cool. We took a tour of the atc
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.040]   They what's really cool about it?
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.840]   Is they have all this gear and of course their engineers use it, but you can too
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:57.520]   You can too is that wwt customer they have on demand and scheduleable labs or workshops
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:05.200]   Like this in vidia deep learning workshop hundreds of labs in fact representing the latest in architectural solutions
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:11.120]   To accelerate customers on AI and their machine learning journey a whole lot more
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   You can learn about these products before you launch
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.600]   You could try before you buy
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.760]   If you're getting a system you can integrate it into your existing system to see how it works
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.280]   You they have more than just these labs they have
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.960]   Articles and case studies you can find it all at wwt.com/
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:34.960]   Twit all the tools you need to make a difference in today's very fast pace enterprise world
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   Uh lab as a service is something they started this past summer
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:46.800]   It's a dedicated lab space within the atc where you can perform your own programmatic testing on anything in that vast ecosystem
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.120]   That half billion dollar ecosystem and because it's virtual you don't have to go to st
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.600]   Louis nowadays that's probably okay
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.640]   You don't want to get on an airplane you can do it from where you are and you can do it anytime of the day or night 24/7
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:05.280]   This is where wwt's own engineers are beta testing new solutions based on the latest and greatest in vidia technologies
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.640]   Building reference architectures custom integrations wwt's new digital platform
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:18.240]   Creates a multiplier effective knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere around the world for you for your their customers

[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:40.320]   Wwt simplifies the complex worldwide technology wwt.com/twit really a neat company
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.640]   Wwt.com/twit
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.000]   Wwt delivering business and technology outcomes around the world business does not stop during covid 19
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.960]   Wwt is there for you wwt.com/twit and I think they're helping a lot of people right now get their work from home
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:06.080]   Solutions up they help design apps they help work with things like sisco's webex to get you set up and get you running
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:14.480]   Uh, this is this is when you're glad you get wwt is a partner wwt.com/twit we are too. I have to say i'm really a big fan
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.280]   Uh, really nice people too wwt.com/twit. Thank you wwt
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.000]   Back to state that up my father wwt. Yeah, would that be cool
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.160]   That would be yeah, they get they get the carpenter build a little box
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.800]   For the nest hub max
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.120]   I do that with my mom
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.240]   What I like to do is uh, she likes to be in the kitchen while i'm cooking
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.560]   So i'll i'll set up the uh, I use the echo show she has an echo show
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.720]   And she's like just sitting there and I can talk to her and i'm stirring this stuff
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.480]   It's really fun. Actually, that's who I should do the thermo mix with
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   She'd be fascinated by that. She introduced me to the queasy nark 25 years ago or you could do it with stacy
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.280]   I could do it with stacy. She would just
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.760]   That's true. I put my way to steal it from the house
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.520]   She'd say out of my way. Let me add it
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.400]   Um
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.600]   All right moving right along. Let's see we kind of drifted
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.400]   We drifted really
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.360]   We started with IO and then we we went we drifted
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.920]   Um
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.080]   Amazon prime video
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   Netflix and a lot of others. Oh, I had data for you. Yes data
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.760]   But
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.800]   Let me now I have data for you. Um, so this is
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.320]   Like come to me data. Um, so this is from the uh, frankfort the frankfortz internet exchange
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.640]   Yeah, it's the largest internet exchange out there
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.920]   We were talking about how uh azure microsoft azure is struggling under the load in europe. Yeah
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:51.520]   Yeah, so since the outbreak of the covid 19 virus they have seen a 100 percent increase in
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.920]   Video conferencing traffic that is just video conferencing traffic
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:03.760]   They are also seeing video conferencing providers take more ports in their exchange. So boosting capacity
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.720]   Overall average data traffic has increased by about 10 percent
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.000]   People are online more and longer
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.760]   Uh cloud fair cloud flare has reported a
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.400]   20 to 40 percent increase in internet traffic
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.000]   For the us when I talked to comcast last week they were doing okay
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.120]   They were like we build for peak now. We're seeing peak for longer times, but we're still it's still okay
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.480]   Um, I know that I read a story and wired that quoted dane jasper talking about adding capacity
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:45.040]   But he was our guy. He's the CEO of sonic net our uh, our internet service provider love dane
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:53.040]   So what's happening is a lot of in most isp's they have capacity upgrade plans already. So what's happening is
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.680]   Usually they anticipate it being you know, they do it when they hit a certain purchase
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.840]   That need of capacity somewhere between 60 and 70
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:07.040]   Usually what happens is they're reaching those capacities more frequently and upgrading but they still
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:13.360]   It's not it's not like a scramble. They just implement the plan again. So it's going to cost them more, but it's not like
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   They're running out of internet if that makes sense
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.240]   Well, that's it's so weird to think of it, but of course
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.680]   Like everything at some point you run out of internet
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:29.680]   I mean at some point they will run out of servers. We have I mean if you look at the places where we're going to see
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.120]   Where there's theoretical slowdowns you have the subsea cables right now
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.800]   Like x percentage of many subsea cables are dark
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.720]   You know tell a geographies a lot of dark fiber out there
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.280]   We could with other words we have room to expand. Yeah, so you would add what you would add is like
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.880]   God, what are those things wave wavelength?
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:58.400]   There's oh, I cannot think of the name of the equipment that you put at the each end of your subsea cable to add more capacity on those
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.800]   Actual fibers that are dark
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.120]   Um, you're literally lighting up that cable
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:11.360]   um you add capacity by adding servers in the big internet exchanges for example, you can add servers
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.360]   You
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.920]   At your central office so you can add it kind of locally
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.720]   um, so there's still
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.960]   There's still capacity you'll see like for residential broadband
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.840]   You'll see your engineers from your isp's if it's cable what they're going to do is something called splitting the node
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.360]   That is where they go out to your premise and they'll
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.000]   Basically cut in half the number of households that are served by each. Oh, no
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.280]   Uh, no, no, that's good. They have enough bandwidth though, right? Oh, all right. I see
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.760]   So what they're doing is
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:50.000]   Sorry, cut my bandwidth in half. What? Yeah, she's they so they cut the number of houses on your node in half
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.600]   So half as many people are using the same capacity in that case. That's called
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.680]   That's what they split the note. That's how they do. Oh, that's interesting and then they bring in more to the head end
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.240]   for the other half
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.080]   Well, they they bring they bring another piece of equipment out
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.120]   Right to serve those other homes in so there's these big cabinets
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.200]   And I'm sure you've seen them
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:19.680]   Around your neighborhoods and the telecom cabinets or the cable cabinets cable cabinets are usually those
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.000]   Boxes that are stuck in the ground and so that's where this
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.280]   This splitting the node in the cable case is taking place and in the telecom cabinets
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.800]   Um
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.640]   Is that your d slam?
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   Your d slam. I believe it is your d slam. I was like, I was like it's been a long time. It's like that hurts too
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.640]   I love the d slam. That's all about the d slam
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   Yeah, so that's where they're
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:51.360]   That's where they're they're basically adding capacity. They usually slot in new cards and then they hook them up. I I don't want to get into like because
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:58.080]   Depending on your your network architecture. It's a little bit different, but and I'm not a super expert
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.680]   I'm obviously not somebody out there at the cabinet. Although I do bug them when I see them. I'm like, can I look inside and see
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.560]   What do you do it right there?
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.520]   What you do? I do that too. It's so funny where the cable guy hates me
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.440]   I do exactly what do you want?
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.080]   For a while
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   Time Warner actually knew who I was and they would like either decide to talk or not talk to me depending on how they felt
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080]   Oh, that's hysterical
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.360]   Oh, that's oops. I didn't mean to press that button. I turned you blue
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.240]   Oh, like a smurf. I turned to blue. I didn't yeah. You want to be blue again?
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.000]   Oh, not not that blue not that smurphy
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.040]   Um, so yeah, I don't understand about this is a good job blue
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.440]   I don't know what he does for ages. I'm clicking things just don't mind me. No, mind me
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:54.160]   Little knowledge dangerous thing. Yes. Um, but we all use the internet like crazy at work. Isn't isn't there a
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.720]   Concomitant
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   decrease in use
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.960]   Um and and companies make all kinds of huge use. I don't understand why there's problems throughout Europe
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.240]   Is it just night time in Netflix? What is it? Well, I mean, there's there's a couple things so
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.960]   Schools for example being online and taking your in-person meetings
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.800]   Into the virtual art are different right? We're making more video calls. There's people at home
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.520]   You know, I think one thing offices do is everybody goes home and then they all are running hangouts or something
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:33.200]   24 hour well 12 hours a day so everybody can be together. There's a lot more use, right?
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:40.720]   And that's why Netflix and the Amazon Prime and uh, youtube are cutting the bandwidth that they're using
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.560]   Uh on their streams in Europe. I don't know why Europe is so
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.280]   Why aren't we more?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.600]   I I wondered about that. I'm guessing
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.880]   There's a couple things Europe doesn't have a lot of cable operators so they don't have mss as many mssos
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.720]   They also have
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.480]   In many places their fiber does not extend as far so they've got like fiber to the
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.280]   Uh node as opposed to fiber to the premise and when you're dealing with dsl and copper
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:12.720]   Um, it's very hard to upgrade copper. There's there's big limitations on that. We're not going to get into that science, but
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:20.640]   Uh, so I think that might be an issue the other thing I was going to say is your work networks and your residential networks are different
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   so
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.240]   think about
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.760]   When you're provisioning a network if you know there's a multi thousand employee office space
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.400]   You're provisioning way more capacity for that
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.160]   Network and you can't because there's still physical infrastructure that it has to go over
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.240]   So like the nodes I was talking about the actual copper wires or fiber
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.840]   You can't trans it's not a transferable
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:53.200]   The bits are not transferable. I guess back that capacity right right being the same as a residential or a so it may cause
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   localized problems. It's not it's not like there's a loss of all
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.520]   Capacity in europe
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:05.440]   And I don't know what's happening. Yeah, and then there's upload and download speeds. So that's the other thing with video
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:12.000]   Most most residential connections are not sync like they're asynchronous asynchronous
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.160]   Is that what the word i'm looking for there you've got you know 300 megabits download, but you only have a symmetric
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.360]   Asymmetric. Thank you. It's like what is the word
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   You're the one that I've used it before yeah asymmetric
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:33.120]   Yeah, and so when you're doing things like video you actually need a much more symmetrical connection. So you thought oh, that's a good point
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.960]   Upload that's right. Um, yeah, because it's all about the upload
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:46.560]   So so those are I don't specifically know what europe's issues all are because I haven't I haven't covered broadband and europe really much
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.560]   But I also had an interesting conversation with a with a german yelena me on twitter
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.240]   Because I I when when maricola announced her changes she limited
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.720]   No, no meetings of more than two people. I thought oh wow good turns out that was in outside
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.440]   You can still go to work. You can still go to the
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.840]   The store wait a minute. Yes
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.640]   Outside but inside it's fine
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.760]   Inside well you should exactly we're not but you still go to work. You still go to stores exactly wrong
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.280]   I was I was thinking fun. I said come on as a victim. I said and the German you don't understand
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.000]   I know germany better than you do jeffle of course you do you're german. I'm not
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.200]   Um
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.720]   And and we just don't have the computers at home and we don't have the mechanisms
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.920]   Oh, yeah, we're working home. That makes sense the way you americans
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.560]   I mean it's been a struggle working from home schooling from home in the states
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.480]   But maybe not as much as it would be in other countries. That's interesting
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.400]   Yeah, hey watch me do something really fun
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   Oh in europe has bad Wi-Fi. That was the other thing. Oh, because they're building that's kind of a blanket statement
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.840]   Sorry, they're building older and have
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.120]   Uh spectrum to propagate. Oh, yeah, we're yeah america's built on drywall europe's built on stone
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.040]   Yes, that's the difference and now ladies and gentlemen. It's time. Let's see if I can get it done
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.360]   Oh
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.320]   For the google change log
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:20.720]   I would never say that I just went shall both to know that I would never call you grandpa
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.520]   Trick
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.280]   Yeah, I got a little heat for our show title last week
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.240]   Boomer boomer room over. Yeah, yeah
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.440]   I got it. I got a cranky email. I did
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.200]   But if you listen to the show, you know, we were just having fun with your daughter who calls
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.440]   Yeah, covid 19 and here's friends boomer remover and as
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.280]   Jeff and i are
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.000]   friends
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.320]   It's okay for us to do that because we are we are boomer. We are boomers. We we can do that. Oh, what are you doing?
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   Leo stop it
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:00.240]   I have to you know, it's one thing to start the google change log. It's another thing
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.560]   Was it easier to have the hard switcher?
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.040]   Panel keyboard thing
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.640]   Then the screen, you know, i've been doing it this way for so long
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.920]   Yeah, okay, they set up a bunch of macros for me years ago in the keys. So I don't even know
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.320]   how to do it on a board
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.160]   No, actually the board's easier because there's buttons and stuff and I could you know this way
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.280]   I'm having I'm having to click stuff with the mouse this long
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   but let's get to the
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.040]   change log
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.920]   And we start with pigweed
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:38.000]   Now I have to say this change log is put together by garston. So let's learn together
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.320]   It's an open source collection
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.600]   Of embedded targeted libraries or as we like to call them says google
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.680]   modules
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.040]   faster developer development for 32 bit micro
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.600]   controllers the source codes at pigweed.googlesource.com
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.320]   pigweed
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.120]   Will I guess if you're I don't
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:08.240]   I don't know maybe it's for rasprey pie or
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.600]   Just say it's for the internet of things and then you can punt there you go. It's iot. Thank you
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.400]   Stacy, what is it?
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.760]   It's iot. Of course, it's pigweed
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.920]   yay
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.760]   pigweed passed
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.760]   uh new google podcasts
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.560]   redesign on the android and it's actually what happened is they put it out for ios
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.760]   And they had to make a feature parody on android
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.320]   So now you could finally download auto download new shows get new episode alerts
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.360]   It's very clean. It's very nice. If you use google podcasts, I think you will be
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:49.840]   Very happy google podcasts updated and I immediately put it on my iPhone and it's it's really quite nice
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.480]   Uh, i'll show you you know what i was gonna be my pick of the week, but i'll show you a little bit later
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.680]   Um, if you use android go
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.160]   um
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.160]   Then you might be interested in the new google camera go which runs on android 10 go edition
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.360]   So if you have a uh inexpensive smartphone
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.600]   hm-d's the company that's manufacturing nokas these days
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.920]   They announced nokia 8.3 5.3 and 1.3
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:25.440]   Uh, the 8.3 and 5.3 are regular android 10 but uh 1.3 is running go edition and they have updated
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:32.560]   The go camera go the whole point of go is it's designed for less expensive handsets that may not have as much umf
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.200]   For instance the nokia 1.3 is running the snap drag in 215
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:44.720]   And uh, but you can still do things like portrait mode, which is which is pretty cool
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.800]   So if you have an android go device
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.560]   Take a look at the new android go camera
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.760]   Google is removing kody from search results
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.400]   Uh, that's that's a feature takeaway
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.560]   um
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.520]   kody and vlc both removed from google search
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:09.360]   Following a copyright complaint from a turkish pay tv service
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   digitirk
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:17.040]   They used a dmc ta take down take down and removed urls from google search
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.520]   Distributing sports content the download page for kody, which is an open source media player
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.800]   Yes admittedly is sometimes used for pirate content, but not always
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.480]   um
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.920]   Searching for kody in google will still show the links to the official site, but it actually blocks the download
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.120]   That's weird that a turkish company could do that
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.760]   world wide worldwide that's
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:48.320]   A little little disappointing google vlc was on the list google flag those urls is incorrect
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.720]   And so they are still in the search results
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.040]   That's not clear if this digit this uh this uh turkish
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.680]   company targeted them intentionally
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:05.040]   Because in the past the group has accidentally included one of its own urls in the takedown in fact they've done that twice
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:14.480]   Okay, kody should be back a vlc is back kody should be back google photos has added
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.240]   uh text selection prompts on mobile
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.280]   And upload origin information on the web the hell does that mean?
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.800]   I don't know
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.160]   So you can now
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:37.520]   Oh, this is actually good. So in the past a lot of these uh text uh on on these screens weren't you couldn't select them
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:44.880]   But now you can which means you can have lens you can use google lens to search it. That's good. So
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.320]   That's actually a huge a huge deal
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.200]   Copy text from image will appear when google detects relevant content
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:59.200]   So there there it is you can see in this image on the left you press copy text from context from image
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:07.040]   It'll copy it and let you do a lens search in it. So essentially giving lens access to more content
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.440]   That's a minor minor update in photos, but still a good one
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:18.720]   We uh another covid delay chrome and chrome os i mentioned this earlier are going to skip version 82
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.560]   Skipper delay
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   There will not be a
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.200]   version 82
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.240]   They're going to go right to 83. I guess
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.240]   They're going to banish those sets. Well, yeah
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.280]   Or they're 82
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.200]   They're going to understand except whatever the room whatever the roman numeral is for 80 83
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.440]   So there was a canary version of a to that won't be a
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.800]   um l x x x i i
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Uh, I like it
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.440]   Uh, so here's what google's going to do. We will abandon current m82 branches, which are in dev
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:08.320]   Remove infra support and stop testing merges to the branches will not push any new m82 releases to dev
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.840]   We will stop stabilization for beta. We will move dev channel to m83 asap
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:19.680]   We will keep beta channel on m81 skip m82 when m83 is ready
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.920]   We've promoted that's what you'll get on beta and then eventually that'll make its way to release
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.280]   I guess this is because of covid
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.760]   Yeah, that's what they said originally was they were going to they're written just because of covid
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.960]   Yeah, because I think people not being in the office and security and stuff is what they said at the time
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.480]   Yeah, so bug bug fixes security fixes other updates to a chrome and chrome os
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:49.200]   Are going to be delayed and in fact don't look for 82. It'll go right to 83
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.960]   Uh, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:58.560]   But it is in the changelog google's ai helps robots navigate around humans in offices
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.440]   You prefer to them to run over the humans
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.120]   Well, I think it's a small step from running around humans to pausing in front of humans and shooting them dead
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.000]   But I'm I'm just maybe I'm a little paranoid
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.440]   Yes, you are maybe I'm just a little paranoid
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.320]   Uh, well the issue is usually when a robot is faced with a human
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.720]   It just stops. It's like I don't know what to do
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.560]   So it's actually nice now can go around it. It goes around. It comes a human the vacuum is vacuuming you go
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.960]   huh
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.440]   Does it does your iRobot stop when it sees you no it goes around you it goes around obstacles
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.320]   Well, my iRobot's old it hits me and then it goes around me
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:41.120]   It bounces off of me basically it's like oh, that's a wall
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:45.680]   We I we said our iRobot
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.240]   Our Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner to work in the middle of the night, which as it turned out was a bad idea
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.240]   It would go off at two in the morning
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.320]   And then it would invariably uh there it just turned out there was uh one
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.000]   Sideboard that was just high enough for it to get the lip under
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.080]   So the camera got under it, but the rest of it couldn't and so it would go boom
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.520]   Boom
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   And I would wake up every night
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.000]   First time it happened scared me hearing boom boom boom
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.280]   Thank god. I was like what the hell is good. So me trying to get in and then I find the little Roomba
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.400]   Little Roomba trying to jam itself under the so hard
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.040]   It's just trying so hard so I picked up the little Roomba. I said no no little Roomba
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.120]   Put it back on its charger and turned it off next morning next night
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.320]   Ak 2am boom boom boom. I told you this story
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:47.360]   So after that happened a few nights, uh, I put it away, but instead of putting it back on his charger. I put it right under elisa's tire
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.520]   Her left uh wheel hoping that when she backed out in the morning
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.920]   She should put the little Roomba
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.720]   Out of its misery. She found it
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.880]   Uh put it back, but it's eventually been relegated to the garage
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.720]   So maybe now that the Roomba can steer around humans and and
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.520]   Etah jares
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.960]   We can bring him back into the house. He's been house broken. You saw by the way a little video there
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.600]   That's actually part of our news. Google's extending
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.440]   Uh contracts for temps by 60 days, which is really great. I think the temptation for a lot of companies is just eh
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.920]   You're a temp. We'll let you know
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.800]   Uh, but google is going to do the right thing and they have the money to do it
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.080]   I think a lot of companies don't but google has the money to say yeah, we'll pay you even though
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.040]   You're not going to be in the UK. They're on employment deal
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.800]   A warning is to pay freelancers what they were earning
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.160]   Or 80 percent of I mean put yourself
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.080]   In the sandwich shop down the street. They're closed
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.200]   There's no revenue coming in. They can't say well, we'll still pay you guys for the next two months
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.240]   boom
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.360]   So, and uh, you know as a small business owner, it's tough
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.800]   Google can do it and google should do it and so should any other company that has the resources obviously
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.840]   Google unveils android performance tuner android gpu inspector and cloud file store
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.200]   This is going to be a series of game things. These are things announced
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.840]   uh around the game developers
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.000]   summit
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.720]   Google had a google for games developer summit. I presume streamed
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.320]   Um, these were gds. These were announced. They're going to be for gdc. That was that's been postponed to august
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.240]   so
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:34.480]   I don't you know if that means something to you good happy google open stadia makers program for indie game developers
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.880]   It's about time. I think that's a really good thing
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.760]   So if you're an indie game developer and you want to be on google streaming stadia platform
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.480]   There here's the opportunity
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.640]   Uh to do that. Uh, it's you have to be developing in unity
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.360]   29 2019.3
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.280]   So
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.440]   There's a little limitation not just any game
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.720]   Google played gpu driver updates in development for the pixel 4s 10 and note 10
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.880]   I would speculate that that has something to do with
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.080]   stadia
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.000]   Um and the announced android gpu inspector
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.800]   Google unveils game servers in beta for hosting global multiplayer games
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.120]   Now this is something google could do really well because they obviously they have global global network
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   centers
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.320]   Right now when you play a game you pretty much choose a server near you
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:34.160]   Uh, but these servers are designed to take the work out of hosting massive multiplayer games like fortnite or call of duty
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.920]   And to do it globally, which is pretty cool
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.240]   I think it it brings the world together when you can shoot somebody from another country
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   Google's travel search. Thank you for laughing jeff highlights travel advisories and airline cancellation policies
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   This was a problem for my son
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:57.600]   He was trying to find a way home from that's right. He was halfway around the world and uh, he was typing in
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.800]   And it didn't in any way tell him well
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.160]   You could book this flight, but you won't be able to get off
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.560]   Uh for instance he found a flight that flew through type
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:14.800]   And it didn't say he found out he was fortunate enough to look at travel advisories and it didn't say well
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.280]   You could fly to type, but they
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.840]   You don't just have to fly back to bali
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.400]   He finally found so yeah
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.520]   So what happened leaving in uh on the 28th the three days
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.080]   He's gonna he found a flight through tokyo and they're gonna let him transit in tokyo come home
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.320]   He'll have to self quarantine. I think for two weeks when he get home. It's home, but at least we're gonna get him home
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.720]   Wow, yeah
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.360]   So this but if but if you use google he was using the google travel search. He says it's really frustrating
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.520]   I can't tell
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.360]   You know if this flight
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.840]   Is is gonna be if I can if I can book it

[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.920]   As they should
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.680]   As they should yeah, I don't actually should do you search for your flights and google?
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.680]   Uh, yeah, because you know it actually works pretty well the google um
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.640]   Google flight thing is really good. I use
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.400]   I get other things too, but google's is quite good. They bought it a
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.960]   So they have all the information. Yeah
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.720]   Yeah, well, I mean I because i'm i'm a prisoner of united
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.000]   um
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   who I hope will extend their
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.320]   their frequent flyer
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.040]   Policy's a major first word of problem is is wishing for your statistical one, but anyway
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:33.760]   Um, I searched there first, but if I want to know what's all going on or what the cost are all that I just in the search bar
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.560]   I just put in flights e wr to

[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.480]   I'll do it right here. You can say
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.160]   Um, you can add united to the search. That's right
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:56.480]   I can add star alliance to the search. Yeah, and it'll show you those and it's a it's a really good
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.200]   By the way that flight canceled. Sorry. Sorry, jeff you can't go to tocchio. Sorry
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.760]   Uh
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.120]   But that no, I think it's really good and then you can uh you can you can click on what airline is is your son gonna fly?
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.600]   uh, you know
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.800]   Oh, so they're still flying that route because they were yeah, they they've they've got rid of all
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.680]   Lawlle halls and they put some back
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.080]   Like the other one is delayed by five hours. It said so, you know
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:27.760]   Valley to sfo on united. Oh, see this isn't showing up
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.440]   because because
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.040]   The valley to tokio leg is probably not united
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.520]   Oh, maybe that's the case. Let's leave that united see how he's gonna get home
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.280]   Uh
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.120]   Potential impact. Yeah. Yeah
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.120]   Yeah
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.880]   Well, anyway, he did end up using this and actually I think he I said, you know, we we have a american express
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.760]   Card you could use their travel
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:58.000]   Um their american express travel agency to do it and I think he ended up doing that
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.920]   I spent some time on the phone with him as they they didn't really even know where you couldn't fly
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:09.600]   He said, yeah, well, I think it's changing all the time. So it makes sense. Yeah, you'd be like, mm-hmm. Yeah
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.040]   It was and if you remember when we shut our borders. Oh, sorry

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.080]   New york is running out of pets to foster. Oh
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:12.640]   True, that's good right because that means all the pets have homes a colleague of mine wanted to get one and couldn't get one
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.640]   They're gone. I
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:20.880]   Think that's a delightful story. Isn't that wonderful as long as they don't come back after the question
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.960]   But i'm like, oh
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:30.960]   You're alone and you want to adopt a dog. That's great and when you work from home, you can so yay
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.520]   That's really I don't have a lot to say about that story, but it made me go
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:43.360]   pet craze is spurring rally in chewy shares amid a market route
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.640]   Okay, this is because this bloomberg and they had to put a financial thing
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.920]   That's the headline of the week
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.720]   pet craze is spurring rally and chewy shares amid market route
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:03.040]   Chewy is a in-home pet delivery service
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.800]   It's like bark box bark box, but instead of bringing you
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:13.360]   Dog biscuits to bring you a dog. Well, they know they're bringing a dog chewy brings you the
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.560]   Bring you like dog food and pet pet pet
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.760]   Chewy was is pets.com in a later time. I my old friend bill growth started pet.com
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.320]   You made fun on for it. Yeah, it was just too early
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.400]   Chewy was huge and then chewy got bought by amazon which owns everything. Oh, okay
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:36.080]   And so we get our our food and litter from them. See they need okay. This is a very first world problem
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:42.960]   Yeah, and I realize how awful this sounds, but I don't know how i'm going to get chlorine for the hot tub
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   She's just order it. No
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:55.760]   Oh, because it's a chemical I guess I don't know I have to go to the dealer and they're closed
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:01.600]   So you know, there's no there's I guess it's just this brand they say no no
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.680]   We want you to buy it from the dealer, but I don't know what I'm going to do. He owes Jeremy hot
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:11.280]   I know i'm not going to be a hot spot for the virus. Whatever will I do?
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.520]   That was actually worse than I thought it was going to be so congratulations
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.080]   I was like, oh no, what's he gonna say you topped it
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.920]   Yeah, I love it. All right. I can't get my yacht wax
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:30.960]   Well, whatever will I do
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.360]   Um, I thought this was a very good story
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.360]   Maybe we can wrap up on this one because this is a deep philosophical conversation
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.640]   And I have a feeling we might get diametrically opposed to points of view, but I really thought this asked an important question from wired
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.680]   Oh, no. Oh, no, I know what it's going to be
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.160]   Why don't we just ban?
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:35:01.440]   Targeted advertising aren't all it was so well aren't all the woes of the world ad tech
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.720]   Surveillance capitalism
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:11.200]   A bait driven by this desire to target advertising if we just said you can't
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.880]   You can't you just have to buy ads in the old-fashioned way
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:21.520]   Yeah, like billboards and mass media or podcast ads or tv ads
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.880]   um wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't you
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:30.640]   I mean first of all everybody agrees targeted advertising doesn't work all that well. I mean all the ads
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:37.760]   Okay, it's sanitizing time before jeff gets in this argument. I just I did my communist joke and I I should all sanitize
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.920]   Okay, I I agree
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.080]   All right, we're gonna sanitize
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   I don't have hand sanitize. I read it here
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.680]   Then I have to use my hand cream because my poor hands. No delicate hands are getting really raw
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:56.880]   So is this is this a non-starter? I mean I probably is a congress is never going to pass a law saying you can't do targeted advertising
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.480]   No, first not now
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.600]   And nor should they I wrote a piece some months ago about this
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.200]   And now I do my hand cream. So it's gonna be right back in my hand
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.200]   It's quite a ritual
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.360]   Make sure you get those cuticles jeff there's
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.840]   I love a manicuous for the next year. You're just worried how to do this. I don't know where i'm gonna get my mani pettie
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:24.320]   Without targeting we end up back at pure mass media with irrelevance and
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.000]   And treating us all the same and targeting is not a bad thing
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.680]   There are small companies that were able to start because they could have efficient targeting they could they could
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.320]   you know sell you
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.960]   The weird stuff we buy is geeks because because otherwise they'd have to just buy cpm
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:46.960]   And we get nothing but junk ads and junk content and the same is gonna be true political campaigns too
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:54.560]   A movement or a small campaign can start efficiently because of targeting and it gives us more relevance and targeting is not evil
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.600]   It was not awful. It's our job as a society to make advertising more efficient
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.280]   I don't think that benefits society
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.760]   And I think that it's very clear that the the the
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:16.000]   Detriments of targeted advertising are extremely clear. No, they're created. No, they're created as surveillance economy
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.920]   Oh, oh calm down just calm down
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.920]   That's surveillance society. It's really because surveillance is when the stazzy goes after you
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:32.160]   And you're gonna end up in jail for 40 years and nobody knows where you are. That's surveillance. Don't don't diminish
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.320]   I'm not saying
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.320]   Self-censorship
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:43.600]   What about not performing as you might because you know people are watching you at all times
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.520]   Yes, and i'm not talking about innocent like i'm not talking about like not punching an old lady in the phase why you're walking
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.760]   No, you got a dance like nobody's watching
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.080]   But being leery about what you say or what you talk about much like people in china
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.320]   They self-censored all the time. Yes
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.000]   Government with jails and guns is going to come after you. That's what i'm saying
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.480]   That versus somebody showing our government
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.360]   Our government is
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.800]   and so
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:22.640]   I understand targeted advertising being frustrating and surveillance capitalism applied there may seem a little over the top
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.880]   a little bit detro
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.160]   but
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.600]   but
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:34.160]   There's legit concern about surveillance capitalism because the same sort of surveillance technologies that give you targeted ads
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.520]   Also can be co-opted for like geofencing warrants and that is a problem
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:46.480]   So you've got to understand like how do we get how do we deliver targeted advertising which is
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:52.960]   I don't know if it's entirely innocuous, but it's not to the level of the stasi
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.600]   Coming to your door and putting you in jail for 40 years
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:02.000]   But the tools are the same and there's nothing in our laws right now that allow you to like
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.720]   Say you can use this for this but not the other
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:12.960]   Problem is law your problem is not the advertising your problem is not the data your problem is the misuse of the data for which we need laws
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.560]   But let's just hear the law
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:22.160]   Fear what's the other law just ban targeted advertising. Oh, google makes 60 percent of its money on search ads. That's fine
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.480]   You can buy you can you you're a candidate. You want to get to an audience is searching for uh, you know
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.360]   Uh, you know, I don't know a thousand dollars a month for life
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.280]   You can buy that but you can't collect information
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:45.200]   It's created facebook. It's created google to some degree. It's create. I mean in its most really only a salvation to media
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.720]   Meet mass media. No, it is killed media's
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.400]   No, it's killing media. No because media were too stupid to get the wrong
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.400]   No, no, it's killing media people don't surf the net anymore
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.040]   Suddenly there's all these paywalls and there's all this mess
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.120]   Because because average eyes are say well, I want to do the advertising
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.120]   No, because average is demanding to do a good hands doesn't it's kind of nice
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.240]   Well, this one's good. It's everyone a hand sanitizer spray with in coconut and lemon
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.840]   And it it not only feels good. It smells good
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.720]   I highly recommend it and this is targeted at everyone with dirty. You buy it anywhere
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.760]   Yeah, I got it on amazon
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.500]   Oh, so you'll get it now in a month. It's a
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.520]   Smells good. Yeah
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:35.040]   Subscribe it's my birthdays in a few weeks and nobody's gonna be able to send me presents. I'm very sad
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.480]   It's like your chlorine problem
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.280]   What about many petties you can't get those either
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.920]   That's okay. I'll send my chauffeur to the store
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.840]   Um
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.120]   I know I think we should get rid of targeted advertising
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.160]   I think this is a very good proposal that would eliminate a lot of
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.520]   A harms in the society without please jeff, what are we gonna lose really?
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.120]   We're not gonna lose anything. You're gonna go back to your ate what you're gonna get
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.920]   You're gonna get the worst of average as far as advertising alone just advertising just period advertising
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.000]   You're gonna get the worst of advertising. You're gonna get clickbait. It's already bad
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.760]   No, our advertising is not targeted. It's targeted only because I get eight books advertising to me with used books
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:23.200]   I actually care about because they know that I've shopped in eight books. It's a wonderful thing
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.760]   You
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.160]   Just wanted us to fight that's all you just wanted us to fight. I know you're playing. Oh, I like I'm sincere
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.280]   I like this proposal, but but I I know it's a non-starter because
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.640]   Congress is well, I would also say that you and all of media should have figured out how to create things
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.720]   I have I don't do targeting
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.960]   You do you are targeting by your nature, but that's not an illegal form of targeting
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.520]   I'm not collecting information about our money. None of us illegal
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.480]   Well, I would like it to be illegal to collect information. You're obviously yeah
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.720]   Just jealous. Yeah, just jealous
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.520]   No, because they're gonna put me out of business because I refuse to do the kind of
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.360]   audience data collection that advertisers have come to more and more expect
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.880]   And so because I can't compete with the big giant ad companies that collect data
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.400]   Like google and facebook and ultimately spotify
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.840]   We will be out of business because we don't do targeting. That's a harm you hadn't considered
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   But it's a it's a real harm
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.280]   I don't think we've gained anything by targeted advertising at all
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.000]   And I think we're gonna lose a lot more including most of the newspapers in this country
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.640]   And because I've been yelling at these newspapers for years that they should have called the first party data
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.560]   And they were too stupid because they kept on insisting. I've been let the only in person to them google killing the newspapers and maggots
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:44.480]   No, they didn't they they gave we ripped off
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.760]   Uh those advertisers for years and years and years
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.600]   Giving them terribly efficient advertising. How much about these advertisers? Who cares? They got into the media that are paying
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.000]   Are we gonna do a commercial in a second? No
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.360]   I saved this for after the commercials
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.760]   But I think our advertisers get value for dollar. They wouldn't come back if they didn't
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:09.280]   But but increasingly they're gonna say well, we only want to target 25 to 50
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.080]   four-year-olds with 150 thousand dollars in income in the pacific northwest
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.440]   And uh at that point we're gonna say well, we can't help you
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.600]   What you're gonna get is what you what killed blogging and killed the beautiful worldwide web that we had
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.240]   You're gonna get direct insertion ads on podcasts that are targeted at you, but are not personal not
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:38.160]   Not host red not endorsements. None of the kinds of ads podcasting does and you're gonna get a lot of small podcasters out of business
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.880]   Or they'll have to make it a hobby and spotify and uh and iHeart media are gonna dominate because they collect
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.120]   Information about their audience. I think this is a great law. I wish they pass it
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.800]   I know there's no choice, but I wish I mean we should have this
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.200]   It's I see I think the harms you describe her minimal compared to the harms that are already happening including but that's
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:06.000]   Interference what you want what you want is about is a little Germany what you want is government protectionism for your business
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.280]   Sorry, no, I'm not asking you about that. I'm asking for governor government protectionism for my privacy
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.880]   Oh, well, I am asking for that. Look, it's not privacy. You're the ones who brought up the consequences
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:23.920]   I'm not talking about the consequences unless you want to the harms imagine it puted or real
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.480]   But I what I am talking about a very real specific
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.600]   prohibition on collecting
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.080]   Private information about people it's what's made google and facebook so powerful
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.800]   It's also what's made them highly relevant and useful and valuable really
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.360]   Yes, really. Yes facebook relevant. Yes. Yes. Yes
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.880]   Really
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.840]   Uh on that note
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.880]   Is there anything I missed any story we missed let's take a lucky loo here
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:02.960]   I think we got I think we got them all I think we got everything in here
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.640]   There's lots of free stuff free to audible uh free stream audible stories and sponsor
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.840]   Uh, I think a lot of companies are kind of but you know the first thing you should look for if you're looking for content boys and girls
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.160]   If you've got a library card
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.400]   Check what app your local library uses because there's lots of free stuff there
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:29.520]   And you want buy some books so so so back to stacey point earlier about about the um finding someplace else to buy
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.920]   So I wanted two books amazon
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.800]   You know the bookstore was may
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.840]   And so then I looked at barns and noble and it was it was full price
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.040]   It was barns and noble and my local store is enjoying this but I just went on book finder book
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.960]   Have you known book finder? Do you guys go on book finder is the best it's across every site used new
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:55.200]   And and i'm looking for a lot of obscure books very obscure books
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.280]   And I can find them there
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:03.120]   Uh, but these two new books I wanted and there was a local store somewhere in america that had them up and the local store got some business from me
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   And I was happy that's great good
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.000]   Every local store should be on book finder
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.840]   Uh, I think they are kind of almost anyway, you know what?
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:17.040]   I use this and it really looks like 1984 all over again. Yeah, I used this years ago
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.600]   I'm glad to know they're still around
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:26.080]   Great. I I did I did find an obscure book on this because I couldn't find it anywhere else. It wasn't on amazon
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.560]   This is around since 9th is owned by
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.200]   Amazon now
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.040]   Like everything is owned by amazon. Yeah
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.760]   Um, and a books is a major portal to use books but book finder is meta to that
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.480]   Nice book finder.com. There's a good pick
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.560]   I did not mention and i'm sure you're sad about this vidcon is canceled
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.160]   Yeah, I won the advisory board to vidcon
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.800]   unpaid to be clear
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.760]   And uh, jim laderbach who's a friend of all of ours
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:59.280]   Uh sent out the email sadly this week that uh, yeah, they just and with dealing with that many young people
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.720]   Uh, even in july it was going to be too uncertain they have to
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.240]   So I hope they do virtual things
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.040]   Uh, the olympics have been postponed
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.560]   That's a significant one good and and I think the right thing to do but boy
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.960]   Talk about economic consequences. Uh, they say they'll do it next year
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.680]   SpaceX
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.600]   Had its first launch delay due to coronavirus. They're they're putting those
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.160]   They're putting those uh star-link satellites up. They've got what 90 up now. They're they're rolling them out pretty fast
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.880]   They gotta get 12,000 up
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.880]   Yeah, they're good
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.360]   toward
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:42.400]   I mean toward 12,000. Yeah, they're they've still got a ways to go but yes
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.360]   uh the uh air force
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.560]   45th space wing confirmed yesterday that
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:53.520]   SpaceX is upcoming salcom watch. Oh, I guess it was a comm satellite
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:01.280]   Uh set to take place at cape canal roll march 30th using a falcon nine put on an indefinite hold during due to the impact of coronavirus
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.600]   That's uh, that's wild
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.200]   Um
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.800]   Let us get your pick of the weeks dacey hickenbotham
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.120]   Hello you guys this is gonna be a double pick because then they arrive
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:22.000]   I'm gonna show them to you but wise is now offering their wise fitness band for 2499
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.760]   Wisey those guys the camera people the camera people the smart camera and sensor people so they've made an activity tracker
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:35.280]   Looks like a fitbit charge, but it has built-in madam a over the bluetooth on your phone
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.200]   um, and it has the ability to control your devices plus a full color led screen
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.680]   and
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.240]   Let's see what else. Oh activity tracker blah blah blah. They also launched a scale
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.840]   And the scale the scale looks nervous
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.440]   The scale is only 1999 what it's amazing
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:04.880]   It does not right now it syncs with only google fit, but it will sync eventually with fitbit apple and samson's health app
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:12.960]   And this scale does a lot it measures the traditional like body measures weight body composition
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.080]   From there, you know detect water rates
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.440]   um
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.040]   lean body mass
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.560]   Um, I'm really excited about bone mass as someone who has osteoporosis in her history. So I'm like, oh, how does it figure out bone mass?
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:31.520]   I don't know. Um, there's a I'm gonna guess it has to do with the conductance
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:35.600]   Testing right so the the you know, they have left foot right foot
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.640]   They send a charge through your body and that's how they do a lot of this stuff
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:44.320]   I don't know how yeah, that's how they do like water in your body and that's how they pick like your fat versus muscle
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.560]   I wonder how accurate that is
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.640]   I don't know, but I ordered both so I will show it how
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.400]   Yay, man. They are amazing the price points that they set
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:50:02.960]   Are ridiculous about their 20 dollars for a smart scale. I have the scale does it's 8.99 to ship it
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.520]   So you're looking at actually 29 and the band is 25 bucks
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:12.160]   Yeah, that's so I think that both of those for basically 60 dollars
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.760]   And
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.160]   That's crazy because I remember I bought the UA health kit like four years ago that is now defunct
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:24.640]   Um in 2014 or 2320. I'm gonna pick another day 2016 is when I got it and that was 400 dollars
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.080]   So
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.960]   So the nice thing about the band it works with wise cams
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.440]   It's got a smart home functionality. So you could use it to turn on lights and
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:39.600]   That's why smart home functionality. So yes, oh, it's not amazon's well. It's using echo though
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.800]   Well, it is yes, you can use amazon's echo. Yes. So that would be their smart home as well too, right?
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:52.960]   Yes, so any of your devices that are controllable via amazon, but it has controllers for your wise gear already on the cameras and so forth
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.880]   that's really
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:59.760]   Cool really cool. It is. Yeah, so I will I'm wearing a charge three
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.760]   So I will it looks like it kind of it does
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:11.520]   So I'll I'll let you guys know how it measures up against that when I when I get my device. They're a Seattle company, right?
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.040]   They are
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:16.880]   Which is unfortunate because I had to pay tax when I ordered it. Yeah, but uh
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.480]   I get the feeling that they're just sourcing chinese
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:25.520]   Here they are there. So their business model is their former amazonians
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:30.640]   Their business model is to source the hardware from china run their software over it and make
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:37.040]   Tiny margins and get a lot of users to buy more and more of their gear. Well, I'm all for that
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:42.560]   So I have the camera as we can find out how the cat was being. Oh, that's right. Um
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:49.280]   Anything else in the wise line that what else in the wise line going back even that do you do you like best?
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:53.600]   Um, I've got the lights the lights are fine. They're nice. They're Wi-Fi lights
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.240]   I also have the sense which is a $20 sensor kit and if you're into that sort of thing
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:01.360]   It's a nice introduction to start playing with sensors
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.320]   Um, you can use it for home monitoring like door open close and you'll get a notification
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.720]   You can also tie it to your camera. So if a door you can set it up
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.600]   So if like the back door opens your camera will start recording
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.920]   Um
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:20.960]   So those are some options for you. I actually set up one of the motion sensors in my jewelry drawer
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.240]   And so if you open my jewelry drawer, I can get a notification
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:28.160]   If it's not me. I want to know you paranoid about somebody in the house
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:33.280]   No, my daughter is now 13 and she thinks it's interesting to steal my jewelry and some of it
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.600]   She cannot borrow
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.680]   To you. She's not keeping it
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.120]   Oh
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:44.960]   And you guys and you guys have a problem about my i'm gonna i'm gonna bring in a privacy lawyer for your daughter
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:51.600]   I think you got surveillance but maternal surveillance going on here. I don't know here stacy
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:54.160]   I do not I do not
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.200]   Have a camera anywhere inside the house, but if if I get a notification and it's not me i'm like
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.880]   Anna
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.480]   Are you in my closet?
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.240]   She's like oh, I was just looking for something like
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:16.000]   Abby was the same shoe size as jennifer and that meant not just jewelry theft
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.640]   shoe theft
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.600]   So so every other mother has eyes in the back of their head
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.840]   Stacey has eyes everywhere. I have p.i.r. sensors
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:30.000]   in the back of your head
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.840]   That's awesome
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.800]   I think it's crazy
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.440]   Apparently it's crazy. That's crazy. You got a problem. You know you could solve it that way
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:46.320]   Jeff you have some numbers. I think oh, let's see what we should do here our top of vice-versa
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:48.960]   Well, I think I think it's bringing back an oldie
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:53.040]   But I think given what everybody's going through the world we should share a conference call bingo
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.640]   Conference call bingo is that like a chat roulette? Oh, yeah, a five by five
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:06.560]   Of everything that we hear on conference calls. Hi. Who just joined? Oh, yes. Can you email it to everyone? Oh, yes
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.200]   On the call. Oh, yes
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.560]   Hi, can you hear me? Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I was on mute. Yeah
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.280]   I have a hard stop at
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.320]   I think there's a lag
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:25.040]   I have heard every one of these on every one of these it's the best
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.000]   Hello. Hello
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.200]   Can we take us offline? That's hysterical and what do you sorry I didn't catch that. Can you repeat?
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:39.280]   What do you get if you fill in the card? Oh, I don't know out of jail. Get out of jail free
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:43.360]   Conference. So I'm sure this has been around forever, but it's just so true
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.840]   I've seen this before but it's really uh now we're all living
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.720]   You could play this for twig. Look at this for like sorry. Go ahead
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.240]   It's still loading
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.360]   Hello. Hello. Hello. We should have to add in things like oh, Leo
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.960]   Where's my punch Leo button?
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.760]   World panel. I'm sure there's twiggling
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.680]   World panic Gutenberg Gutenberg. Oh, yeah, there's that's a drink. It's right. That's not my old bingo card
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.920]   It's not even bingo. That's just a drinking game
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:23.120]   Um, and I mentioned already but I'll mention it again and I'll show you in fact if you have not used google podcast
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:24.640]   it's actually a very
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.000]   uh credible
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.640]   Podcast client now available updated on android but uh now available on iowa. I just think it's on iowa
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.640]   So I think it's very clean and clear
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:40.080]   um, this is this is my home page because uh, uh, these are things actually
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:46.560]   It isn't my home page. This is my home page my q and my you can now download
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.520]   But uh, this is I guess this is their discover
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.080]   No, no, there's my home page. How do I get the uh
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.280]   How do I get the discover you can airplay to
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.960]   Where there it is. Ah the the search
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.680]   The magnifying this weekend grandpa
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.320]   I love it. How do you stay she how do you talk on this thing?
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.680]   Uh, they have a whole section on covet information if you really want to get anxious
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.920]   I I'm looking for everything that isn't covet at this point. Yeah, no kidding. No kidding. You know
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.440]   Recommendations. Oh, there's linux action news. There you go
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:27.200]   Uh, so though there's law I guess they must be these are recommendations are clearly based on my interests
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.400]   So that's that's cool a lot of linux stuff in here. Oh, there's uh, there's twit
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.640]   So that's fun
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:41.280]   Uh google podcasts the one thing I really like about google podcasts on android is you can make a uh shortcut on your
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:46.160]   Desktop for on your launcher for all the podcasts you listen to so each of them has a dedicated button
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.320]   Obviously you can't do that with uh with apple because apple won't let you
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:58.720]   Uh, jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at kunie. He is a buzz machine.com. You craig new mark graduate school
