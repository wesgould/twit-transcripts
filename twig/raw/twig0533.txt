[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.900]   We talk a little bit about Google actually in the end buying Fitbit and what that means for its wearables

[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.040]   Third out of four weeks. I'm having so much fun doing it. So thanks for welcoming me back to the show
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   Joining us as always Jeff Jarvis. Of course. How you doing Jeff?
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.140]   There we were supposed to talk so you can get you out. Oh
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.240]   Okay, no, no, this very little this show would be very not that very entertaining if we didn't talk
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.200]   That's that's kind of a prerequisite of podcast. I think nowadays of course the the the devious me wants to take you both down rabbit holes
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.320]   And only to leave your kids stranded. That's how cruel I am
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.920]   You're gonna keep my kid from eating a snack. That's what you're gonna do. Yeah, Stacy you can buy them also joining us
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.520]   What are you gonna say Stacy? Oh, I was just gonna say something about Jeff being mean or not mean
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.120]   We know this already. Yeah, retcon in chat has a great idea. This could be a silent movie edition of the episode
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.080]   Perfect for a podcast as a format. It's the mine
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.760]   Episode the mime episode that'll that'll get people to like watch the video if that's your goal like if only you are watching the video right now
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.560]   Jeff trapped in a box
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.360]   Jason trapped in a box
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.000]   Jc not participating. Hey, no one knows where you are. So it really kind of works
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.720]   It's true. We're right on the other side of the glass right I am in a box. Yeah, yeah
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.800]   Yes, indeed on the other side of your mic
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.720]   Your mic stand though Jeff because the mic stands destroying the the illusion. Oh, that's true. Yeah, fine car
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.240]   Everybody's well not everybody's a critic but Carson is
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   With a K
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   With a K. Yes, exactly
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.520]   Karsten is a critic with a K
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.080]   Let's see here. So we got some we got some stuff although
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.120]   I feel like this top story was was it last week's top story the whole Fitbit thing? No, it wasn't actually
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.080]   Speculated on Tuesday the speculation came out and then Friday they announced it
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.400]   They were they were right on the verge of announcing it and then boom they did it Google
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   Went and bought
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.520]   Fitbit stumbled into a puddle of Fitbit
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.360]   For 2.1 billion dollars
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.520]   Announce that acquisition last week and of course ever and the announcement mentions the next evolution of where OS
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.840]   So it's kind of but but Google didn't really clarify what their ultimate plan is is it to go the nest route and let Fitbit
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   Kind of be its own thing
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.480]   Well, they sort of clarify. I mean they said it's gonna become part of Google
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.960]   That's true. That's under Rick Osterlo. So devices and services. All right
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   I mean do they give the I mean the acquisition is a close
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   So I wouldn't expect them to have the full plan that they could tell us all right now, right?
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.200]   But I feel like we've got any said that it's gonna make where OS better
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.920]   So what does that mean? So what is where it makes you wear OS better?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.480]   Again as long as they don't mess with the Fitbit hardware
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.960]   I think Google needs and needed fitness data and Fitbit has it and
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   If Google's looking at its competitors presumably Apple and Amazon
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.400]   Apple has all of this incredible health data available to it. So
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.080]   It needed that because doctors are getting involved and think about what happens if your doctor prescribes you something that
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.400]   only works with Apple and
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   Then Google's gonna be
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Shut right out of that. So
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.520]   This this makes a lot of sense and it also helps Google with their goals to have a ubiquitous helpful home
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.320]   You know or a ubiquitous helpful assistant that's not just in the home
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   But it's in your car and it's in your life as you walk around
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.280]   Tells you when to stop driving and walking lazy bastard
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.960]   It actually I think my smartphone used to tell me that every now and then it would be like get your butt up
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.000]   It would say something to the lions and I don't know what setting I had it on
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.800]   But it used to track my steps and every down then it would yell at me for not taking enough
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   You're not walking do people really I wasn't carrying my phone. That's the problem
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.640]   I remember when the Apple watch came out and that was the thing where suddenly, you know
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.280]   You'd go to an event and every everybody would get the notice at five to the top of the hour that they needed to stand up or whatever
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.520]   Like is that a feature that people still keep activated?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.560]   I imagine that's one of those features that maybe in the beginning you're like, oh, it's doing me a favor than a certain point
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   It's like well, that's really annoying
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.240]   No, I love mine. It totally like I mean if my Fitbit if I don't take at least 250 steps an hour
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   It's like and now sometimes on the show you'll see me glanced down and I'm like
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.120]   Quick somebody else talk so I can stand up for a second exactly second. I can jog a place
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.280]   All right, so yeah, you're right. I mean I think prior to the announcement the rumor was saying that alphabet would buy and then
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.160]   Maybe that was a little bit less clear. What what that would ultimately mean the announcement was made that Google is buying Fitbit
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   Under Rick Osterlo so that really does shape things a little bit more than what we knew beforehand
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.680]   What do you think this is gonna do for Fitbit current Fitbit users because I mean again it goes back to this
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.840]   This thing the Fitbit was you know its own brand successful or not
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:44.200]   I mean, I think people vary in their opinions on whether Fitbit is a raging success or has stagnated or whatever
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   but
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.960]   users have
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.640]   Appreciated I think the fact that Fitbit was kind of on its own and now suddenly it's being swallowed up by this
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.720]   this big behemoth and
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.920]   People are kind of a little skeptical about what that means for their health data and that sort of stuff
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.800]   I think as long as they handle the the acquisition as well as Fitbit handled their acquisition of Pebble
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   Will be just fine
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.680]   And I would say Google has a lot of
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.880]   So I really don't want Google to mess with the hardware
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.800]   just exactly
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.440]   But
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.760]   What if I could tell my like I do fitness tracking and all these other things
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.400]   You know what if I could tell I track like water consumption through Fitbit I could just say to my Google home
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.360]   Hey gee
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.800]   You know add 12 ounces of water to Fitbit that would be nice
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.280]   If I could say hey gee add 130 calories to you know, whatever
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.520]   That would also be nice or you know
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.880]   This is gonna sound silly
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.920]   But I would love to be able to walk by my Google assistant and have it encourage me like as I walk by I could use the
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.440]   Ultrasonic sensor that they've just activated in their devices if we want to talk about it later
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yeah, it can be like oh, I guess it would need the camera for me because I don't know if it would want to
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.760]   Tell my husband. Yeah, you've been active for 60 minutes so far today and he'd be like what no I haven't
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.360]   But I think that would be kind of encouraging
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.520]   I would totally set those things up
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.920]   But I did once plug in my Fitbit to a electrical outlet that was plugged
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.760]   My TV was plugged into and I did tell it not to turn on if I hadn't taken a thousand or ten thousand steps
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.160]   So I'm a little weird yourself. Oh
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.320]   Wow, so so so interesting
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.360]   No, well, I was just gonna say that's interesting
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.320]   So you basically programmed it so that the TV would not turn on unless you had taken the appropriate amount of steps
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.880]   I did that several years ago with IFT and
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   My husband
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.120]   He was like yeah, get off your butt or turn that off
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.200]   I see where you were headed with it, but yeah, there's unintended consequences and Jeff what were you gonna say?
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   No, I was just gonna say I got
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.640]   Got an overdose of tech hot takes on the story. Yeah, there were a lot
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.800]   You know where we're going through the practical stuff of how what do we wish for and how can it work?
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.920]   But I the two obvious hot takes her. Oh my god. I threw out the Guardian
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.040]   I threw out my Fitbit the minute I heard because you got Google and privacy and you know, just relaxed
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.080]   I'm being cares how much you sweat and then the other is
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.920]   Google ruins everything that it buys and their Fitbit's doomed
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.520]   Well, I think ways is in fine shape myself and it's I just I just get sick of the tech press
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   Not knowing what to write so they just write some hot takes stupidity and
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.000]   To be fair Fitbit did have way back in its beginning days
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.640]   They did have a little kerfuffle around
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   Users having sex and that being something obvious that you could tell looking at their data that was automatically set to private
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   So whenever I buy like a new device I always check my privacy settings and I flip everything off
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.440]   but I'm just saying that how could you know you were having sex because of
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.160]   It extrapolated it because of I think time and activity or something. This was you Google Google Fitbit
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.480]   You know users privacy and sex. I'm sure you're gonna come up with a story. This was several years ago. Okay. I
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.500]   Don't know that you didn't want me to talk about porn
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:18.340]   Sex and porn are different things. Let's not go down this road
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.160]   Do I dare enter this?
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.840]   2011
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.760]   After users sex stats exposed
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:37.160]   Hmm if it actually has done in the past although people did get freaked out like they've done some stories like when San Francisco had the earthquake
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:44.240]   It actually did a post saying hey, here's how many people woke up during the earthquake or something along those lines
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.120]   Yeah, so there's there's really like from a
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.000]   huge swath of users all around the world you can start to look at
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.040]   How people behave and invisible trends that are kind of interesting. I don't I mean there are interest
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.520]   I don't I don't know if you can do a lot with them, but
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.840]   They're kind of fun to know
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.960]   Kind of along those lines trying to find the story because I'm pretty certain it's not in the rundown
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.320]   But maybe it should have been
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.440]   I'm sure you guys read the
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   Didn't ring put out a tweet about Halloween and how Halloween is always its biggest time
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.360]   Of year and had all this data breaking down by the hour when the doorbells were being run
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:36.160]   And it accumulated all this data and laid it out in an interesting, you know graph or whatever and then everybody of course
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.440]   It was like oh, so ring can do this huh?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.960]   They've got that granular data that they're tracking of all these different doorbells being wrong and that's interesting
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.680]   Oh, you could tell which neighborhoods were prime for trick or treaters
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   I would pay for that data because every year I buy too much candy whenever I move to a new place
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:01.720]   I get so hopeful I buy a lot of candy hoping that I can have children come and give them candy and see their costumes
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.480]   Darned it if every year
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   No one shows up
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.560]   So so Stacy we live we live in a
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.240]   Houses are far apart and there's long hills up and down
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   Right, so we're not we're not a good place for trick or treaters at all and my wife has some candy
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.240]   We shouldn't get much to get some and so this year as I drove home from work
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.000]   I said others there's like eight cars out there with kids must come with a neighbor's mission
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.840]   How many kids I said I don't know 1520 we don't have enough candy we turned off all the lights
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.320]   Because we didn't want to disappoint
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.400]   Others your costume is good you have candy
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:54.480]   So you showed that you know what's creepy about the ring thing is it's like we filmed thousands of kids yeah, right?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.840]   That is creepy. You see the one did you see the great one?
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.120]   Kid comes to front door sees there. There's there's a bowl outside
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.880]   Seize the bowl is empty takes some of his candy out of his bag to put it in the bowl. Everybody's cabling over that one
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.320]   That's nice. That's nice. That's like the opposite
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.040]   experience of what I had the very first year I installed ring at my phone at our house and
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:26.920]   We wanted to go trick or treating so we left out the bowl of candy. I may have told this on this show already
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   but we left out the bowl of candy and
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.200]   Went on our way and when we came back an hour later the bowl was empty and we're like wow
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.600]   I guess you know there were a lot of trick or treaters while we were gone the next day it occurred to me to check the ring
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.840]   You know my ring account because I'm sure there would be video and sure enough
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.360]   I was able to find one video of these two kids one was on watch one was totally on lookout like
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   You know out there looking out to the street
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.160]   Make sure no one else was seeing and the other kid was at the bowl like dumping it into his bag
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   They were all laughing and they run off and I'm like hi old got you kid. No, I mean, you know
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.640]   They were probably like I'm guessing like ten
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.600]   ten boys in boy's
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.320]   Yes, yes, of course. Yeah. Yes boys
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   Because my daughter
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:23.540]   She grabbed like two or three pieces of candy and put them in now she would root around for the good candy, but you know
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:32.080]   And they would peanut butter so David Farron hold the yeah, this is it. Yeah, look he looks shocked. There's no candy
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   What does he do he walks away?
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.920]   Hold on mom
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.480]   Let me let me throw some of these in there
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   Oh, that's really nice. That is isn't that the greatest
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.920]   What candy don't I want?
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.600]   Oh, man, it's a tootsie roll somebody else can have the tootsie roll
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.880]   Yeah, those things are evil. I would totally give those
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   David Farron hold the
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.000]   Magnificent Pulitzer prize winning Washington Post reporter covering Trump's corporate work
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.000]   tweeted he said would you live in Washington? This is what your kids get somebody put a at RNC Republican National Committee pin
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.240]   in his kids
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.960]   Oh trick-or-treat bag. That's fun
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.840]   These two wasn't a mega hatch. Is it worsted raisins or
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.440]   I mean at least you can eat the raisins
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.200]   So I remember to as I was thinking we were doing a recant we had a candy crisis
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   Somewhere we got a bowl of change, you know a lot of pennies, but to make that worthwhile these days you'd have to give them a pound of pennies each
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.400]   Oh, yeah, that would be an insult to get a get a couple of pennies. Here you go
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.240]   Sometimes we've resorted to quarters in the past
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.320]   But yeah, but I can get expensive pretty quick. Yeah
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.520]   Well the alternative I mean, let's see a bag of like a bag of candy
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.360]   We buy about three or four bags of candy each year and they're they're good candy. So it's like 16 bucks
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.040]   Okay, so
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.400]   you know
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.960]   I mean, yes, is it as economical as candy, but
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.760]   If you have like a cute kid come
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.880]   You know, you you don't want to like be like, I don't have anything for your kid. I'm sorry
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.800]   I told my that's when the light goes out
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.440]   Yeah, I told my husband where the
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.200]   The last minute candy my candy is which I can't
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.280]   Only he can know about it because my daughter comes and steals it otherwise
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yeah, I know I didn't raise her right
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.880]   Um
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.640]   Yeah, and I just now realize now looking over the dock we missed the opportunity for you stacy to talk about
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   Right the missed opportunity of amazon buying fitbit. Oh, so this was kevin's story and
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.560]   he is
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.120]   Convinced well not convinced he thought amazon for some of the same reasons we talked about is
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.480]   It doesn't have access to fitness data and this week we found out the pixel not the pixel. Sorry the
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.240]   Oh, are they the madam a elixir?
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.080]   Echo buds
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.600]   Echo buds. Thank you. Carsten. I was like the whatever echo buds
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.720]   um, they have fitness tracking in them and so
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:22.320]   Kevin was like why didn't they buy it that would have been great and he came up with a bunch of use cases like the subscribe and say for
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.000]   Snickers I thought amazon. I don't know about anybody else
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.480]   But I get super excited when I find a product on amazon that i'm looking for and i'm like, oh my god
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   This is the coolest thing and if amazon could tell that my heart rate was elevated, maybe they could like
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.000]   Be like oh stacy's excited. We should jack up the price or they could lower it
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.960]   It's gonna say that's not much of a feature then
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.880]   No, no, that would be a disincentive, but yeah, it'd be good for them
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.560]   Certainly yeah an amazon's hurting right now. So they got to do something to uh
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.360]   to make some money because
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.080]   Yeah, their life is hard. It's like you know, yeah, their life is really hard
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.480]   Um
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.560]   All right. Well, that's that's fitbit and ring. Let's see here
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   We've got
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.920]   What are the fun stuff do we have before we get into some of the climate change or
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   It all gets really heavy from from here on out. Uh sure we could talk about climate change because uh that
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.640]   Apparently there's two things that happen back to back this week
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.080]   1100 more a little more than 1,100 google employees
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.640]   assigned a public letter of
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.720]   demanding that google
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.280]   Make significant changes to its environmental efforts
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:46.400]   Uh, they are demanding that google eliminate a carbon their carbon footprint by 2030 and end all contracts that rely on fossil fuel extraction
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.720]   um, also
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.920]   There were a lot of demands here also to end the relationships with
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.280]   uh, quote entities enabling the incarceration surveillance displacement or oppression of refugees or frontline communities
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.960]   Also cutting funds for climate denying think tanks lobbyists and politicians
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.240]   um
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.520]   All very great goals for the company
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.760]   Um, but quite uh, you know and quite a lot of employees. How many total employees with google like is 1100 even
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.040]   Very like a large cut of the pie. I'm not really quite sure but
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   I would guess probably not
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.520]   but still
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.080]   Uh as of the end of 2018 alphabet had a hundred and 3 000 employees
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.520]   Roughly
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:41.120]   It's a pretty small amount of employees, but not insignificant 1100 more than 1100 google are signing this at least 1
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.160]   At least sends sends a message
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   Yeah, a little less than 1 percent
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:58.800]   Uh, Amazon did this not too long ago. They did this back in september 1800 worker walkout where Bezos then pledged that the company would cut carbon footprint by
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   By the year 2040 and of course employees are saying that that's not enough. So
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.960]   um
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.920]   So that happened but then a day later and I and totally unrelated i'm guessing it's just the way the news works
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   A google launched a startup accelerator targeting sustainability and climate
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.640]   Beginning in 2020. It's going to function as part of google's
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.120]   Uh google for startups
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   Uh program, uh to think it's good business. Sorry. It's a good business decision. Mm-hmm. Yes. This is this is this is a growth area
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.800]   Absolutely
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.640]   and google has so
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.000]   Yes, I I think
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   I think there are a lot of things here like when my daughter talks to me about climate change, I feel like
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.720]   Educating her a little bit about the world and the trade-offs that you're going to have with these things
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.480]   I'm not saying it's not worth it to have these trade-offs, but it's important to understand them
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   and so like
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.720]   ending all contracts with people that are involved in fossil fuel extraction
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.560]   that is a huge business and ending all of those contracts or
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.560]   That will have ramifications and cannot be done quickly or lightly, right? You have to replace that and google has worked very hard
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   partially because of economic reasons on
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.400]   Powering its operations, which are significant
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.360]   Consumers of energy with greener energy. So if you look at their data centers
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.160]   The way they built them is to optimize
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.480]   Energy efficiency and they've been buying up green power
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.880]   They've been trying to power them with as much green power as possible. So
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.160]   And for google again
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.320]   That's its cost of goods sold. That's that's its operations right there is
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   Data centers and those things consume a ton of energy. So
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.040]   I'm not saying these displays are wrong, but
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   Google is not terrible at this. No, it's actually a
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.400]   Googling
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.280]   And in 2016 google announced that they would their entire global business would be powered by renewable energy in 2017
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.320]   And I can't find anything that says they didn't do that
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.120]   Yeah, I remember that. I remember that
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.480]   Yeah, you remember back to in the early days of google.org
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.320]   They did major projects around wind and geo and I can't remember there was a third one
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:32.800]   Where they were investing huge amounts of money and in long-term research on energy. So yeah, they've been pretty good
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.720]   You're right Stacey. Mm-hmm. I mean you can always be I mean like every time I take a hot shower
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.800]   I'm like dang this is extravagant and it is
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.160]   But it's also really nice to have a hot shower. So like
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.040]   I just Google has actually done a lot
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.840]   Towards environmental things
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.280]   Well, I'm sorry pardon me for that. Great energy. But the first year I went to
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.080]   Dabo's
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.080]   I went to a session off campus with Larry and Sergey
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.280]   and Al Gore
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.320]   and
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.080]   They you know, this is early much earlier in their in their history
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.920]   But they were they were talking about the need to get renewable energy cheaper than the cost of coal
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.640]   and that that was going to have a huge impact on the world and on their company and
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.280]   You know their vision really was that when you get to that point and you can get power anywhere on earth
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.880]   Then you can get computer and connectivity anywhere on earth and it was a it was a strategic goal for the company
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   Yeah, and it should be
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.840]   uh
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   Now some of these other things like and relationships with entities enabling incarceration surveillance displacement or oppression of
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.080]   That's very different and that's going to be a really
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.480]   I mean, do you want to be the IBM that was colluding with the Nazis right now?
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   you know people are arguing that
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.320]   Amazon google companies the palan
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   the companies working with ice and other organizations in the u.s
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.840]   are morally equivalent to that and
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.640]   That's a tough line for a country or a country a company to
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.000]   to stand on or to figure out where they want to stand
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.080]   so
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.840]   This is a so the climate stuff. I feel like google's doing a pretty good job
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.320]   Yes, we can do better. We all should be but on this other stuff. I'm like
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:35.040]   That's my biting my nails. Well, you don't get what you don't ask for
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.000]   That is true. Maybe it's something along those lines going back to the climate for a second
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.560]   the so um, I think and someone mentioned this in chat, you know part of this might be
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.720]   uh purchasing carbon credits. I know from an operational standpoint google's made a lot of changes
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.680]   Uh in order to kind of be carbon neutral
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.280]   uh, but I know carbon uh carbon credits are
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   often used to kind of offset things what like
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.400]   And I guess this is kind of my my my lack of knowledge in in this aspect of things
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.320]   But like what does that actually mean when you're when you're buying carbon offset
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:19.520]   Like is that the same as reducing your energy usage? I mean the net effect would be the same or
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.320]   I mean, I obviously it would be best if you eliminate your carbon usage. Period, but
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.520]   It is a good alternative
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.160]   I mean it is an alternative. It's it's trying to so the the whole carbon offset is trying to
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:43.760]   Put an economic price on something that we currently don't really price in which is the cost of our fuel and the way we power
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.160]   Are things on the environment, right? So that's what it's good at it is
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:57.680]   Because you are buying like you're buying from people who have generated carbon offsets who do not use the energy that various
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.520]   It can be uh global like uh
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.200]   Ngo type standards or it can be actually mandated standards
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.360]   um
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   if you don't uh
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.280]   Consume that energy you can sell it as an offset to others. So
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:23.200]   Again, I think it's more of an economic thing. I think it's good, but I think we at this by this point in time where we are
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.400]   We should be doing better. Right now google does do
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:34.720]   A lot of energy purchases and makes commitments to things like wind farms in areas where it's putting its data centers
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.960]   And what that does is it provides a
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.560]   So it says I guarantee that i'm going to buy x number of megawatts from you each year
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   And that helps those projects get financing and it provides them with a customer, right?
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.800]   So it it does this and has done this in dozens of places around the world
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.600]   so
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.720]   You know
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   Those are probably
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:09.600]   More effectual just because not only can it it's it's building a project and funding infrastructure or helping another helping a company fund its own infrastructure
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.520]   but
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.640]   So
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.000]   So I don't know. Yeah, no that that's that no that clarifies
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.600]   Um, I appreciate that and actually cr1 in chat says it's like housing developers that pay a fine in lieu of actually building affordable housing
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   I don't know if that's a good
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.400]   Yes, that's actually comparison, but that that makes a lot of sense to me
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.440]   I mean it yeah
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.800]   Yeah, it's putting putting a financial kind of number two that usage
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.520]   It's making it an externality. So something that isn't right. It's making an externality real right right
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.800]   Okay. Oh, I like that indulgences for the 21st century. Yes. I'm a sink
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.560]   Who says that carbon credits feel kind of like indulgences for the 21st century?
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.640]   That kind of has a title ring to it. Watch out. Watch out. I'm gonna I'm gonna get into gutenberg real fast from there
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.440]   Luther to gutenberg. It's a very short hop
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   Moving moving on actually let's take a break. We'll take a break
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.160]   We're gonna we're gonna put a pause on this gutenberg thing that you were just about to launch into
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.520]   Maybe you maybe you decided to launch into it afterwards, but
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.080]   Uh, let's take a break and thank this sponsor of this week in google

[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   Poor jeff
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:28.240]   But I but I am ready to do a fascinating story about porn. Oh, okay, fine. Let's talk about
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:37.120]   This is relevant this time so uh, I went to this I because i'm doing my gutenberg research. I go to
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.800]   Uh, use bookstores where they always have books on book sections
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.600]   And there's a place called oak knoll in new castle
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.360]   Delaware that is like nothing but that huge thousands of books on books. So i'm in i'm in geek heaven
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.440]   um
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   And I and I come to this book randomly on the shelf censorship for it against I think okay. Well, that's if you're good and where I come down
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.160]   So I I've forgotten this see if you got your youngsters know this
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.800]   um in 1968 president johnson commissioned a
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.680]   presidential commission on pornography and obscenity
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:20.160]   and because it was just seemed to be ravaging the nation pornography and uh, so as it went along
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:26.960]   uh, richard nixon then came into office and hated that this existed he kicked managed to give an
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:34.480]   Ambassadors ship to one member of the commission and put on charles keating charles keating is famous for having belonged to
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.280]   uh groups against uh bad, you know porn and such but charles keating was also famous for starting the
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.320]   uh savings and loan uh crisis in america leading to he was um
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.200]   Yeah, he was he was a founder of citizens for decent literature ink
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.680]   um
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.560]   So
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.760]   Uh, what happened was the commission report the 600 of some page on page commission report
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.640]   Uh, it's its recommendation was to repeal censorship laws
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:12.960]   Well nixon hated this the senate on both parties hated this rejected the findings went crazy
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.880]   And so then they came out with this book but but I found out as I was researching
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.960]   A clever publisher took the free government report
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.480]   and augmented it with photos of all the things discussed
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.520]   and
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.080]   The editor and the publisher were arrested for obscenity
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   Publishing the government's obscenity report and served prison time
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.440]   Wow for that
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   So why am I why the hell does this have to do with any we're doing?
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.680]   So as i'm reading this book which has has has positives negatives from all kinds of interesting people
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.160]   uh, nat hent off
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   uh, the father of
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   former new york times editor joe leville, uh, rabbi
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.680]   um
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.160]   jr. Christ my predecessor is a tv critic and tv guide and so on well as you go through this book
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.000]   What you see is an incredible parallel to the discussion today
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.560]   All the discussion about how we have to save people from themselves there that you know, i'm okay
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:19.200]   I just doesn't affect me but all those people out there. Uh, we've got to do something to effect them
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.800]   um
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.880]   Uh, it's it's just amazing. So i'm going through this down. I'm going to write a long post
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.200]   About about about that parallel and about how sometimes we just figure out things we get it
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.680]   Uh, but in the end they so you june mccarthy former presidential candidate june mccarthy is in here
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.800]   Um, and i just it's it's fascinating. It's absolutely fascinating to me. Maybe not to you
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.080]   But this parallel it is part of me kind of the moral panic of the age
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:52.160]   Um that we moved from the idea of harmful content was porn at the time and now it's
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.760]   It's things on the internet. Of course there are differences. There's scale. There's the fact that everybody can do it. It's less controllable
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.720]   Uh, but we don't have i don't think the but part of what this what the commission said
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.120]   Was that there wasn't data that said there was direct proof of harm from porn
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.880]   Uh, and we don't have the data yet on what harm we fear
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.200]   And so that's the end of my little solo liquid, but and when was that book riddin?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:22.480]   This was 1970 1970. Okay, right right after the commission so so they they got uh two fours 12 people to write
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.560]   These essays real fast and got this book out and i've just been been um
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   Devouring it this week about to write a post tomorrow
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.120]   That was it say it wasn't what didn't it didn't hurt it was about poor didn't hurt
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.000]   That was not painful porn. You're right
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.800]   Thankfully that was not painful porn
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.520]   Uh, yeah, very interesting. Um
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.960]   So what is the boogie man right now? Is it just is it fake news as uh in air quotes?
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:55.600]   No, I think it's I think it's hate speech hate speech. Yeah, you're right. I think it's it's and and and I don't like any more than anybody else
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.440]   you know, I don't like
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.360]   Well, it's just like poor imping anybody else, but I think that's gonna be a carsten street lighting against me
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   So i'm not gonna go there. Um
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.000]   Uh, you know, I I get the issues with porn
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.720]   but uh at some point society learns to kind of filter things out and and not a lot of the fact of them and yeah
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.600]   It's there and okay and we move on
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.920]   But we're concentrating on a such level. I'm obviously that I'm not including people individuals being harassed
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.720]   And threatened that's different from content. That's a behavior. It's bad
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.480]   Yes, but your content and the way it's structured can influence your behavior
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:39.440]   Um, some person a person actually jeff who you should be reading who's doing some really interesting work on this is at github
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.880]   uh, sarah, what is her name sarah
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.720]   Chulbot's lady
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   I'm gonna find her
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   Um
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:55.680]   Because she is a content moderator and she's done actually at github and has done a lot sarah chips chip's
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.600]   Um
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   And she has done some excellent work
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:06.560]   Investigating how the structure of github's commenting features has enabled the community to
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.760]   Uh alienate women or people of color
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   And she also found ways to fix it. Yes. Yes, that's what's so cool. So she's writing the story. Yeah
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.200]   Yeah, she's writing this very thoughtful
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   And I'm trying to think of where she's writing them, but um looking
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.160]   I'll look for it because they're really good
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.000]   And it's it's actually very much in line with what I think
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.960]   You're probably I found
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.440]   Yeah, I'm not trying to defend
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.760]   Hate speech. I'm not trying to defend and say everything should stay up. I
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   There does need to be work at this
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.320]   But we're we're struggling with trying to figure out
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.720]   Oh, I lied to you. It's not github. It's stack overflow. Gosh stack over. Oh, okay. Sorry. She's on github
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.600]   Well, yes, but
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:58.080]   Sorry, she's a stack overflow and that's where she's writing these posts and doing this. Sorry in my bad, but that'll help you find
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.840]   Oh, it's her pin to me
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.400]   Oh, okay
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.080]   What a very bad day at work taught me about building stack overflow's community
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:17.680]   So that's that's that's valuable for my social our social journalism program. Yes. Well, that's why I was like, oh you should love this because
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.640]   It's it's really helpful
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.960]   And it talks both about
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:29.120]   the user experience and how in this particular one, it's it's how
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.320]   Her experience it never might just read it. I'm not going to summarize something
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   I read like several months ago
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.920]   Wow, she's also a great
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.800]   That's a great recommend. This is so social j because you know
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.280]   I talked I've talked before about a company called spaceship media that's in the San Francisco area that
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.800]   Convenes communities into conversation and what they really done is have developed a methodology for having
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.440]   Respectful conversation and productive conversation. That's what we have to work on is that
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:06.720]   Bemoaning it saying the internet's ruining everything is is absurd. It's another hot take that's going to be damaging to freedom of expression
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:12.800]   But trying to figure out how we work with this that's that's that's what we can do it. We'll figure it out. We really will we figured out porn
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   We'll figure this out
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.600]   Well, sometimes you do have to make a few wrong turns just I feel like we've made a couple wrong turns with no
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.760]   Oversight and now it's time to like start experimenting with oversight and be willing to adjust because
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.480]   That's how we're gonna get there. You're not gonna well. I'll argue we've made wrong in terms with oversight
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   Well, yes, but but that's that's kind of what democracy is you kind of everybody's like
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:46.320]   Fix it. We all fix it and you're like, oh, we created a new problem. Just mix it again look over there squirrel
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.760]   um
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.840]   I mean, I think the what
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:56.480]   What I end up going back to is like but maybe maybe the difference now is just scale is that scale is such a
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.600]   a big difference between what we're encountering now versus in the past that maybe
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.480]   Maybe you know, maybe the solutions are
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.600]   It doesn't follow in the same path as something else. Maybe let me propose Jason challenge
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   Sorry, we propose that the yes, you're right about scale, but scale also is a proxy for another issue
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.560]   Which is unheard voices now heard
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   I know
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.480]   and um, but but I think that's what causes some of the
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.080]   um fear and trepidation and
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:36.240]   I think we have to include diversity and equity and inclusion in this discussion
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.640]   Um because what I hear all the time is the former gatekeepers say and put it back in our hands
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.480]   Everything is okay. Well, you're back in your hands. You didn't pay attention to a lot of populations that are now heard that have sense people
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.080]   Fair enough and yeah, so I think we you know we scale
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.120]   Scale as a concept
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:02.560]   Masks other agendas. Yeah, the story this week that abc had a had a piece on
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.000]   Epstein that they spiked three years ago, right
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.880]   um and everyone being surprised at why trump won and now like the people who
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.200]   voted for him were coming out of the woodwork and not afraid to talk about how
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:23.120]   What they're like and so we have a better idea of the sort of person that votes for him
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.640]   Carsten are you sick?
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   No
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   You sound very different today. Huh?
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.440]   Every time every time you you pop in I'm like who the what no
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:41.520]   Yeah, you don't you don't sound like your normal timbre, huh? Yes, but that's okay. I mean, I'm just like
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.440]   I'm I'm not ill to my knowledge. Are you taking podcast voice lessons? Perhaps perhaps that's it. Oh, okay
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.520]   I should take some
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.320]   Talking podcast talking lessons instead of singing lessons. Yeah, I would agree
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Uh, on that last one I I had to do a double take because I wasn't quite sure it was you
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.560]   Uh that I realized it was
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   So I'm not sure what it was, but there we go
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.800]   Maybe today. I've got the skype bug that lowers your voice
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.000]   You just sounded more rural
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.240]   Yeah, just right there
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   I don't know
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.640]   You do sound different the skype lower people's voice
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.960]   Um, we've we've run into a bug on skype that sometimes
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.840]   Um people sound like they're on helium and sometimes they sound like they're unfree on so
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.680]   Oh, it's wait when you you can't you can't inhale free on is it a battery? You're strong
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   Well, um
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.920]   I I had somewhat of a mispent youth and yes you can
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.080]   Does it make you high?
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.240]   Yeah, it's like it's like whip it's it's like
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.480]   It's really really intense whip it's that make your voice and it makes your voice low. Yeah
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.080]   You guys I didn't know this
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.920]   I'm spreading these things. It's super
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.880]   super
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.160]   Bad for you. Yeah, super bad for you
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.760]   Uh, no
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.880]   Okay, um, I I'm sorry Jason. Let's get it back on
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.400]   I just was like, no, I I there's an I have wondered about helium because
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.520]   I was and then jamboree is wondered about karsten. So the wonder train is
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.000]   So so since we're on misspitt misspitt things. I don't this is that's a bad transition
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.080]   I just read a story. Trevor for got on from the washington post about
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.520]   Um
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.800]   a brain stimulation treatment for opioid addiction
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.840]   Yes, deep stimulation
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.600]   Fascinating same thing used for Parkinson's. Yep. Hmm
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.440]   Oh, that makes sense and it turns off that so that you know, they had a case a guy they named in
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.640]   pennsylvania
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.600]   Uh, who since he got one pain killer when he was he had a football injury in high school
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.440]   He's been an addict ever since and nothing worked. Nothing worked. Nothing worked
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.880]   So they put in something the size of a quarter into his brain and it stimulates parts of the brain
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.440]   to to change the behavior of the
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.120]   uh
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.040]   of the
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.800]   the addiction mechanism
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.920]   so
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.400]   Science does good things too, you know, yes
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:15.520]   You have an electricity in your brain is like a really popular way to solve all kinds of problems
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.600]   We are just getting to that point
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.320]   Yeah, I look forward to the amazon version of it
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:27.040]   The amazon health helmet when you stick on your head and he'll zap you
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.520]   Maybe
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.440]   I don't know that just reminds me of shining a laser into your home assistant and uh
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:41.120]   Explain this to me how that would work. Oh, I'm so excited because kevin vu is like my favorite researcher ever
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.600]   I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.000]   Yeah, I definitely know exactly how it works
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.600]   But the story here is that apparently men's microphones like the ones that are used on home assistants
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.240]   um are all apparently
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.160]   um susceptible
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.000]   to being
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.520]   To to something called what they're calling light commands, which is essentially shining a light or a cheap laser pointer
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   Or something like that into the the microphone the men's mic
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:15.280]   and researchers were able to do things like, you know send commands to unlock doors visit websites
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:21.920]   Uh start vehicles that sort of stuff. So I don't understand how you're able to do that with light but I don't know either
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.520]   Yeah, that's very exciting. So what happens is when you shine the light by it has I mean
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.440]   Light like sound is a wave. Um, so if you modulate your frequency in certain ways
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.760]   the um
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.920]   The microphone perceives it as sound
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.960]   So basically just imagine you've got waves at different amplitudes
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.160]   Light sound whatever and and that's how it does, but they don't actually know exactly how it works
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.280]   Which is what trips me up of like yeah, go science
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.120]   um
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.480]   Bye
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.320]   What's fun about this is it works through glass
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.160]   and
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.520]   it
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.080]   Is viable although you would have to
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.480]   Think about you would have to figure out the proper frequency modulations to figure out
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.680]   So, you know, you would have to buy the 200 something dollar laser
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.880]   You would also need to download from some dark website the appropriate
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:22.960]   Code for unlock your door. You would have to hope that there's a door attached to it and it doesn't have a pin
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   So there's a limit of things you can do with this and it feels like it's expensive enough to not be an awesome prank
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.880]   Is it stimulating voice or how is it making the actual command? Oh, it's simulating. It's simulating a voice command
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:41.600]   But you can't hear it, but you can't hear it because or is it transmitting sound in fact it's using laser
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.000]   It's using a laser
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.280]   Um to translate sound no no no the laser so
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.920]   Sound is
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.600]   A wave like what we hear is a wave, but light is also a wave. So a laser has
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.320]   waves as well
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.280]   Their life is a wave and so is it resonating on the the mic? Yes
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.040]   It is them, but they don't they don't know how they don't know how it works
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.360]   But the idea is that you pick certain frequency modulations for the light and it's to the device
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.000]   Which does not hear like we do right?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.360]   It's it gives it the same reaction
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.320]   as a person saying a command
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   And you got to think that the MEMS microphone the way these work
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.560]   Is something it it detects a wave
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.360]   So it's just when I say something it doesn't know i'm talking
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.120]   It just knows that whatever waves hitting it makes it vibrate in a certain way
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.200]   So it's doing this when I talk right
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.680]   Well, it's also listed in reek
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.840]   So when the guardian was doing the Snowden story
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.640]   GCHQ the nsa of the uk had a fit with a guardian
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:55.360]   And and went up and assisted that from across the canal outside the editor's offices
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   They could you bad guys could focus
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.480]   a lasers onto the room and
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.040]   Listen to everything there. I think I saw that spy movie once
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.800]   Sounds but yes, yeah
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.480]   Um, yeah, so so yeah, that's and so the reason I think kevin
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.120]   Fu and everybody should just stick a google alert for him and whatever university is at
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.560]   Okay, this is pro tip from stacy because all he does is hack MEMS
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.400]   It's all he does and so if you think about it, it's just a bunch of MEMS, right?
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.640]   Because we're taking the signals from the real world and converting them to digital
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.560]   So in 2017 he did all this research about hacking accelerometers
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.040]   Um, so he's just a really cool fella
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   so
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.960]   That's it
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.880]   Okay, maybe you won't put a google search, but you should because he does some great research
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.080]   You'll keep us up to date here on just we can google
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:01.680]   And so far they aren't doing any of this in jackrion yet because I am six episodes in so
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.440]   I can't say your name on the chat, but i'm with you
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:13.040]   Sounds like something you might find in jackrion or something. Um, I I really just now realize this ours technical article
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.560]   I actually have some videos that really that show kind of like the setup
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.520]   Uh, the whole setup on how this is done including, you know, like a waveform on a screen
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:28.800]   That you know, that is the command that's then converted into the laser light that's shot into the google home
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   Uh, so yeah, it's a cool process. Wait, so there is there is an actual so the speaker thinks it's getting sound
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.560]   It's getting a waveform, but in the form of
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:47.040]   But through light and not sound but it's it's like it's sound looks to me like they're converting the waveform that you would hear
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.000]   Into a light waveform right and to the MEMS
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   The MEMS microphone, it's one and the same. It's a waveform hitting the microphone
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.080]   In such a way that it receives that as the words that it's programmed to recognize
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.480]   That's why this life is a wave
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.920]   And i'm going to ride it all night long. Oh, that's a different song. Sorry
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.440]   That's a highway
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.920]   Uh
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.560]   Cool that's interesting. I definitely understand that story a little bit better than I did initially so
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   That is fascinating
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   Science and technology is cool
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.480]   Um, let's see here google is
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:35.760]   developing or at least part of a team of developing an open source secure enclave chip called open titan
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.160]   So this is of course to improve security on devices
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.920]   Um
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.280]   The secure enclave exists on the root of trust on the device, but some you know would ask
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.480]   How the enclave itself can be trusted?
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.720]   So this is an open source project to kind of address that
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.360]   And they're basing it loosely on the the root of trust chip that's used on the pixel three and the pixel four
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.000]   Uh, and they're still developing it. They've got a
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.040]   Consortium of companies non-profits and academic institutions that are all kind of pitching in on this open source project
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:15.360]   And so it's currently in developed in an unfinished state
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.960]   But you can go to the open titan github repository
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.080]   And uh, take a look at it as it's going along
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.000]   And they hope that people do because they want to have kind of the opinions of
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Of everyone as it's developing so that they can take a look at all aspects of this and keep things even safer
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.800]   I have a question on this which is probably bad a bad sign for y'all
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.400]   Um
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.840]   If you don't know
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.040]   Stacy, that sure is not I don't know if I have an answer but go for it
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.680]   I'm trying to understand so arm has their secure aren't enclave technology
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.280]   So their their stuff is trust zone and that's it's a physical
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.760]   Section of the chip intel has their trusted execution environment
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.440]   Um
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:04.640]   So is this the same thing as that only it's a google open source version
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.800]   That's that's my understanding. Yeah, it's based on a whole chip though. Not just part of a chip. There. There's
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.160]   Okay, um root of trust chips
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.280]   that um
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.440]   The basically there's the there's the security chips in the in pixel phones
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.960]   That they're raising this on so it is a dedicated secure enclave for a device
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.880]   So it is not so because like so then it is not designed for
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.760]   Running an application ensuring that's secure. It's designed to make sure that
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:44.320]   The device itself. Yes things going to that are not messed with and tampered with as opposed to securely running an application from that area
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:51.360]   Right. That's my understanding is that it would be a protection of the device as a whole and not just a particular app or something like that
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:58.160]   That yes, this has lots of variation or lots of use for uh the internet of things. Okay. Sorry. This is something
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.960]   I was trying to figure out yesterday when they I was like
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.120]   And iot I mean
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:12.160]   Pretty pretty insecure in a lot of different ways. Do you think something like this would be like is of dire need and iot right now
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:18.480]   From your not only do I think that a bunch of other companies and vendors and customers think that so yes
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.200]   This is already happening. That's why arm has done stuff with they've actually developed something called psa
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   which is
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:33.120]   uh, it it makes it easier to code to their trust zone area so people can have secure devices it also ties it back to the cloud so you can
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.840]   Basically your device can call back and say hey, i'm this secure
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:45.600]   Secure device right here. I'm identified as blah blah blah with my my private key and then the clouds like are you really and it's like?
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.280]   Okay, you are
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.640]   Okay, i'll give you this and then when it arrives they're like hey
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.680]   Did this really come for this thing and they're like yeah
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.480]   And they check and then it runs
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.840]   um microsoft has that with azure sphere and
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.800]   There are probably a half a dozen private companies doing variations on this. Okay, so yeah, it's a big deal
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   Or it's a it's a thing that exists
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.760]   I just realized while you were going through that you should create a comic book of some sort with where you like
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.000]   Stacey explains
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.800]   Stacey explains complex technology topics through the conversations of the technology components of these things
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.280]   Uh, just call it
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.680]   Stacey's that was lame thought it was great
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.280]   Thought it was helpful stacey explains
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:44.000]   There we go show title stacey explains love it. Uh, let's see here. What else do we have?
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:51.680]   Can we talk about the google nest ultrasound sensing whenever it's yeah, you don't have to tell me about it now
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.800]   Yes, let's do it right now and then we'll take a quick break
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   Where was where was this one? I know it's in here somewhere is it in there a lot of it?
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:06.240]   It's it's in the the changelog. Oh, it's down in the change. Oh, okay. Don't talk about it. No, no, no, no
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:11.440]   We have a yeah, huge ton of stuff. Yeah changelog is too full. So i'm moving it up
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.880]   This is good to do now
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.000]   So this I feel so bad you guys because I told you there was going to be solely on this particular device
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.200]   And I had lied to you because it's not solely it's this ultrasound chip doing similar things
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.240]   Um, so instead of the cool 60 gigahertz chip all this is basically doing is using the microphone in the device to be like
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.320]   Sound my sound waves and when someone interrupts that pattern
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:40.720]   It's like oh, there's a person here and then it adapts and they just like today the updates started rolling out my
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.280]   I was forget what this thing is called. I'm so sorry you guys nest hubbacks
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   Well, how could you possibly forget? It's only had three names
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:56.080]   Minus 10 or something is not updated to this yet, but the description of this is so amazing
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.240]   I cannot wait. I wish I could show it to you now, but it's talking about how
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.520]   The display adapts based on how close I am
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.400]   So if I ask it the weather and I'm close it will give me like a lot of granular weather detail
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.720]   But as I walk farther away, it will just give me like the temperature and big font
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.600]   And that's so that's neat
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.040]   I'm just like way to use technology to drive a better user experience
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:28.400]   Not just to put cool technology and things so now it just needs to tell you to to go outside and walk because it's really nice
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:35.120]   See in once they've bought Fitbit they can see me getting closer and be like oh, uh-oh
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:38.480]   You are not approaching that couch walk the other way keep
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.440]   Keep you keep walking. All right keep going stacy. Keep going
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.320]   So I was confused. I thought that this was a and they actually had a sonar
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:56.640]   Uh, I did do that. They're actually just using the microphone. That's that's what this story says. That's cool
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.160]   Yeah, I mean were you thinking that the solely was was in there?
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.880]   I was so I thought it was more like positing wouldn't that be neat if but
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:10.240]   No, I thought that they were gonna do because they talked about so they talked about the feature which is
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.320]   Detecting people as it got nearer to things. Yeah, they didn't really talk about how they were gonna do it originally
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.880]   So I assumed it was solely because solely was being used for that in the phone
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.280]   And that's a common use for 60 gigahertz ultra wide band sensors
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.520]   But that's not this use
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.680]   And it's the same thing the nest mini is doing remember how we talked about it like that was it last week? Yep. Yep to be like
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.640]   I am lighting up for you so you can actually see what things you need to press
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.520]   Yep, so I'd change the volume and everything. Yeah, it just makes me wonder what then
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:51.280]   Why is one necessary when the other does the same thing? I guess because they do it in different ways. I guess so yeah your phone
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:59.440]   Your phone shouldn't be constantly emitting an ultrasonic noise. That's a good point for I would think a lot of reasons
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.680]   Um, but it would also be pretty battery intensive. I would also think I don't know. This is this is me
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:11.600]   Not sure. Yeah, you're probably right and the way that they built so solely into the phone
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.440]   It's not that it's necessarily battery friendly. I'm guessing
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:19.920]   Uh, but maybe it's better than it would be if we went the ultrasonic route
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.960]   Um
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   I'm my jury's still out for me and and solely on the phone, but we talked about that last week
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.520]   Um, it used a little bit more and you know, it's great my alarm
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.720]   Six months. Yeah. Yeah, totally
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:40.560]   It's worth checking in and see like are you still using it any appreciable like but like improve it to your life
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:45.280]   But my alarm clock out so give it time not to use it on your phone
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.440]   But for other people to develop things that makes sense on your phone. This is an ecosystem play
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.800]   It is but even google has said like we have no plans
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:59.840]   Right now to uh do third party api access for this like it's not on our plans right now
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.840]   But I guess they say that until suddenly they do
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:09.040]   So that's how it all works. All I know is my alarm clock app sleep is android doesn't support it
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.120]   I tried it this morning. I woke up
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.080]   What wave my hand over the top and it did nothing
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.560]   So I still have to tap the screen to turn the alarm off. Oh no
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.160]   Like like a caveman
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.560]   Would have to do oh and they they do say that they tested it with dogs and cats because that is an interesting question
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.400]   Does it drive your pets nuts? Oh, yeah, and the answer is google says it doesn't
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.880]   I can't wait to get it because my dog
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.360]   I have had devices that drive it nuts
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   So I'm very curious because that would really suck because my dogs are a little neurotic
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.560]   Yeah
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.800]   Suddenly you're talking around circles dog reen the ring doorbell
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.640]   And knowing how to do it
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.640]   My old i had a german shepherd when I was a kid who rang our doorbell
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.040]   Every time i'd jump the fence and it would just go ding dong
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.440]   That's awesome there
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   It's in it's a never run down
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.360]   the run down
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.400]   So the dog was locked out the owner didn't know it realized the dog had locked out. So the dog comes up
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:17.440]   Rings the doorbell hello everybody there goes back and waits
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.320]   Why did it just bark
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.120]   Because they're not guess owners upstairs
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.000]   That is amazing. Isn't that great
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.160]   That goes back one more time now. I know what I have to train my dog to do
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.480]   As long as i come back and it's gonna bring the doorbell again. I'm just gonna let in
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:45.600]   Seriously owner i'm still out here look I rang your doorbell let me in
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.920]   I'm your dog. This is why recording on ring is such a wonderful thing
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.040]   There we go
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.040]   It works back
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.280]   Oh, I was just reading an advice column actually and someone had a video doorbell and they
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:08.800]   Said it was it was a very funny. I think it was in carot feeding on slate and they're like I caught my son using
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.720]   They had forgotten their key and he was using horrible language including multiple instances of the f-word should I discipline him?
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.200]   And I was like whoa
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.680]   The smart home has jumped the shark
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.360]   Wow
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:30.960]   The columnist did say that you should not discipline your son for cursing on video in the front, but you know
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.840]   But yeah, maybe maybe bring it up and relate
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.720]   Maybe bring up the point that he is being recorded
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   Yeah
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.640]   When you forget when your key doesn't work and like your hands are fuller. It's cold. That is the perfect time
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.800]   I think to drop an f-bomb. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yep. I completely agree
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.920]   Let's take a break and then we'll talk about more of these topics and a whole lot more
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.000]   Maybe we'll get through some google and get to some other topics because there's a lot in there
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.160]   Uh, but first this episode of this week in google is brought to you by privacy
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.160]   Dot com you don't use the same password everywhere
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.720]   Uh, so why use the same card number when you shop online?
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.360]   With privacy dot com you get a brand new virtual visa or master card
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.880]   Card number for every purchase that you make online with just one click such a cool idea. I love it
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   It's easy
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.760]   It's simple to use you simply download their browser extension for the from the chrome web store
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:35.600]   Or they have android and ios apps that you can download and you link your virtual cards to us checking account or your debit card
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:42.800]   Uh, that needs so you can freeze and unfreeze cards you can set spending limits per charge per month or per year
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:50.160]   With privacy dot com's virtual card. You never worry about being billed twice or being upgraded without your consent

[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.800]   For their support of this week in google
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.600]   Um
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   Let's see here apparently chrome books are getting a boost on their
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   their support
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:15.920]   They always ship with an end of life date which has been pretty good when you compare it to like android device, you know, support
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:22.800]   Um, but google is apparently revising the end of life date for 135 chrome books
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:29.440]   To give an extra year of support in many of those cases most of those cases actually some of them like the slate
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.400]   Uh, they're boosting that another two years. So the slate for example you get an extra two years
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   Through june of 2026
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   Which just makes me wish that phone scott symbol that are support
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.560]   Uh, because that's a that's a nice long chunk of time for support
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:51.280]   Uh, there are some devices that only get a couple of months extra, but most of them seem to get a year or more. So
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.720]   Uh, that's pretty awesome. We've got chrome books. You're gonna be able to use them for a long long time
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.360]   So kevin by the way
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.240]   Wrote a 3 000 or was it 4 000 word review of the person will go
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.240]   Three though
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:12.720]   And I think I think i'm gonna go try it out. I gotta wait till i can touch it in a best buy
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.960]   But I might do it thanks to kevin
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:21.040]   Yeah, his kevin's biggest frustration is people who write these reviews a lot of times do not use chrome books on the regular
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.280]   Yeah, so it feels like right
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   They're not optimal reviewers for people who who love them, you know or who know what to expect
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.920]   so right right
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.680]   And we she asked we should plug about chrome books kevin coples great site out chrome books dot com
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.880]   That's right. So he says premium price for a premium device
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.760]   Uh 80 hours of using the 849 pixel book go
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.440]   And uh, yeah, it sounds like he's pretty pretty happy the only reason I want the tablet the one thing
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.400]   So I use the I use the flip thing online now for tablet when we take off or land in an airplane
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.600]   And they tell you to put your large device away, but you can keep your tablet so I turn into a tablet and keep watching my show
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.440]   I'm guessing that's not a major reason to not get a flippable device
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.480]   You you just yeah, you hacked the airplane, uh rules
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:21.440]   How much time do you spend on the tarmac? I mean really that's a question only you can answer
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.320]   Oh fair amount a fair amount so maybe that's worth it for you
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:33.840]   I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I buy some wacky devices. I mean look last year or last week. I brought christmas lights that cost a hundred
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.280]   $60
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.480]   I mean, that's true. You are pretty wacky. Um, so far had maju from the new york times
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.920]   Just asked a question on twitter i'm eager to get your answers to this
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.040]   Um, where the hell is it here?
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.600]   um
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.920]   He was asking whether there was anything
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.080]   um
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.520]   In the last
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.960]   Was there any tech released in 2010s that completely changed your life
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.160]   Nothing for me. He says the way I liked voice assistance and better wireless headphones
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.200]   But on the whole was kind of an incremental decade
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.480]   He says then the comments of course are the best part of it because people then nominate things
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:26.240]   Uh gab Rivera says uber and lift but far ahead says uh kind of on the bubble ramped up this decade
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.240]   But started in 2009
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:34.960]   Um, so I guess that's a question cameras on cars became required
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.400]   Far ahead says huh fundamentally
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.760]   But did he not run into things
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.280]   I guess not uh dropbox said somebody nope. Sorry. I started in 2008
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:53.040]   He but my nomination somewhere in there is of course
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.920]   Chromebooks
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.960]   Oh, were they yeah winded chromebooks launch
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.000]   They're this decade surely are they?
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.080]   No, hold on really not first first chroma
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.480]   If you're watching this winded chromebooks
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.800]   2011 2011
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.840]   Kevin
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.120]   Yeah, tells us ipad was the product of the decade this decade
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.480]   interesting choice
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   okay, well
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.520]   So i also said like like cardia heart afib thing that's minor, but it's being dealt
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.200]   What about you guys? Is there anything in this in this decade?
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.440]   Hmm
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.920]   I'm gonna go with amazon. Uh the echo
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.880]   I really think that changed
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.520]   My life and I think it's a precursor to a lot of things that are gonna be really exciting
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.680]   I would also say
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   let's see lte
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:57.200]   Officially launched in about 2010. I mean I in 2008 that's the definition of incremental though
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.880]   No
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.360]   Huge
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   Three
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.320]   Yeah
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.360]   But I don't know if like I can't remember when karaoke like
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.880]   In 2008 I went to one of my first demos at like ericson's lab, but I don't know when it launched
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.920]   But you know what phone browsers were like in 2008
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.520]   Well, I used to have a trio for god's sake, you know, so I was just major improvements
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.360]   Oh, yeah, painful so painful
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:38.000]   So tell you senera launched the first commercial lte service in sweden in december 2009
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.400]   So do we count that?
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.960]   No, you don't know he's gonna be in the u.s. It was 2010
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   Yeah
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.080]   That's that's right on the right on the bubble there
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.600]   But that's that's the sort of thing that's about Ben white says the tesla model s
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.720]   That's just a car. I mean I love it, but it's
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.360]   Oh, I thought you would have had more
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   Ubiquitous charging stations and they've done an open charging standard they could have been that technology, but they did not
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:16.480]   iPads were this decade really were they yes, I thought that they were but no
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.640]   They they must have been because I remember when I pad today launched
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.760]   It was that when I was been at twit when it since I've been a twit it was what is it 2012?
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.240]   I'm guessing for iPads 2012 2013
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.840]   iPad launch the droid was 2010 first iPad was 2010
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.720]   2010 April 2010
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.760]   So it was the g the g2
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:46.720]   The first android phone that was that was uh, that was uh, the o's okay because I know the
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   Verizon droid was
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.320]   2010 20. Yeah, 20 2011
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.880]   The moral of droids never mind never mind. I was 2009
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   Yeah, because the nexus it didn't android launch what did did android launch with the nexus? No
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.720]   Google while google's first was the nexus one but well before that. Yeah, it was okay
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.120]   Yeah, there was a sidekick and all was back into i
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.520]   Yeah, that's a hard question to answer
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:23.840]   I guess for me like the one that that that has been big has has been that the voice assistance the google homes
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.720]   I mean we've got them in every room. We use them every single day
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.280]   um
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.440]   And i'm going for lge and i'm gonna say it's december 2009 it
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.720]   We kevin kevin said he did his first test on verizon in december 2010
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.600]   um
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.080]   And you know when the carriers launch their first networks, they're usually like five square miles in like a test zone
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:56.000]   So i'm saying screw it. It's a very first worldwide launch of anything of lte was december of 2009
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.240]   I'd give it to you. I think that's firmly
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:05.840]   And the first the first us phones were late 2010. Yeah, and that's been huge. I mean, yeah
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.320]   So i'm voting for lte and far-hod can kiss my butt when he tells me it's on the bubble. I'll just be like
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.480]   If he wants to come on right now drop into the show and defend his uh
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:25.760]   Josh all of it says we chat we think a little more internationally than our us focus world we chat certainly changed a large chunk of the world
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.280]   That was 2011 you guys
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.920]   Yes
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.800]   GPU's cracked image net in 2012
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:45.040]   Boom see it in convolutional neural network things computer vision is a huge technology that happened in this decade
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.080]   Oh my god, this is such a fun topic. I could talk about this all day. Mm. Okay. Y'all are not excited about this, but I am
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.480]   Alpha go
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.040]   Alpha go was kind of big
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:04.960]   What's the game? It'd be it better. It goes back to what was his question that was invented or that just saw a big
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:11.200]   What tech what knew what was there any tech released in the 2010s the release he changed your life
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.080]   Like how or I would say as how
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.800]   Smart phones did or even a fraction of that. I see that's why he's trying to argue
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.000]   It's because he's always negative far-hod. He's trying to argue that it's a
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.600]   Incirmative
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.400]   decade
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.240]   a
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.520]   Because I'm saying we've got LTE we figured out how to do
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:36.080]   Neural networks at with at a scale that's possible like at a reasonable scale and price
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.280]   So that's huge and that's having an effect on our lives even today. We just don't necessarily realize it
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.680]   I'm just aren't using them like the way we use a smartphone. Yeah, it's not necessarily consumer technology, but in industry. It's huge
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.800]   Um, let's see. What else have we come up with?
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.880]   We
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.880]   Have five
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.520]   I see where you have a lot of votes for VR
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:06.720]   VR really I guess it was yeah, I'd started this decade did it but did it change our lives the way smartphone did
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:12.560]   Well, but if you're if you're into VR as a geek then maybe it did your life
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.280]   Maybe it did for certain gamers and everything. Oh, there's one vote here for LTE
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.200]   Yeah, that's that's a good one. That's the hill I'm dying on
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   um slack
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.760]   No, no, I mean slack is cool and it
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:36.720]   Yeah, but like I used to be on slack every day and now I don't have colleagues really so I'm not on slack and I don't miss it at all
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.800]   Inbox by google
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.200]   No
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.600]   You can argue
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.560]   the the mirai botnet changed things in a very
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.920]   Google way we're still feeling the effects of that change but
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.120]   And I did google drive start
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:05.520]   Ah, that's good. What are you throwing these productivity apps at these these are apps. These aren't core technology. Oh, cool
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:14.560]   Google drive launch, uh, google drive file storage synchronization service launched April 24th 2012, but that's okay
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.600]   That's files combination of chromebook and and drive
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.360]   Hugely changing for me. Yeah, I mean chromebooks a big one
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.840]   I think for a lot of people they'd hear that and they'd laugh but those are the people that
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.280]   Well, I haven't tofels talking about or as as what was it?
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.440]   He just said kiss my ass
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:37.120]   I said he can kiss my butt because I was not saying that other word on on well, but you
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:46.560]   All right, that was that was a little diversion there, but it was a relevant diversion. I would say kickstarter launched in 2010
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:50.960]   Kickstart affected a lot of people's lives
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:59.120]   AWS AWS launched the first cloud service. It was s3 in 2006
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.840]   After that and google cloud in azure, but I don't know about azure they did that late
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.760]   Um, let's see here
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.960]   All right, so change left. I don't know. I can't I keep thinking about things. I want to look up
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.160]   I was like
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.160]   BuzzFeed no no no no no no no sure we can do the change log. Let's do it. No, I'm just like
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.120]   Whatever
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.600]   That's okay. We'll do it
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.080]   We can always circle back around
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.760]   We can all right for all looking at the clock we can always circle back around
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.360]   Oh, this change log is long. You should call it change long
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.160]   Uh chrome 79 beta supports web based vr
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.440]   We're talking about how amazing vr was for everyone almost on the level of smartphones. Not really
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.800]   Chrome based
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.400]   web based vr via web xr device api controller supported by gamepad api
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:07.040]   And the support is going to come to chromium powered browsers
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.920]   Including many of those that you find inside of vr headset so content developed for the web but supporting vr
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.440]   And those api's will make for more dynamic content online. So that's interesting
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.560]   Uh, I don't know how much we'll see that proliferate, but it can now
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:31.680]   Meanwhile chromo s78 stable is rolling out. This includes virtual desktops, which we talked about our previous
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.200]   I couldn't figure out how to get the virtual desktop. I just figured it out. Oh, did you?
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.920]   Yes, I don't have the latest version
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.840]   Um the I updated just before the show because because i'm a i'm a good show member. I did just for the show good work
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.280]   Um above the five key is that as that
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.600]   Box with two lines next to it key. I don't know when you call that
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.360]   Above the five. Oh, yeah, the the switch a switch back and forth between between yeah
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.160]   Brought browser windows. Well now on the top there's a new desk button
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.680]   Oh, okay, go to that you create a new desk that when you get the new desk
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.040]   I couldn't figure out what to do when you hit hit to control n and you can get a new browser and then you have multiple desks
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   Okay
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.240]   Not bad
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:20.320]   We've been waiting for that. I think last time kevin was on or one of the times kevin was on he was very very pro this feature
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.520]   so
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   It also has the ability to
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.240]   Have an easier printer selection process because printer selection on chrome
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.040]   Chrome OS can be kind of a pain in the butt sometimes
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.600]   And apparently they simplified things
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:39.680]   So it won't require setups for connected printers. It'll just see them all and you can connect directly. So that's nice
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.000]   Google's area 120 developed
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.120]   Pigeon last year you may remember this was an app was an experimental app kind of like ways for public trans
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.200]   transportation
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:21:02.160]   Initially launched it only in New York City, but now it's going live in boston, chicago, la san francisco and the dc area so
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.520]   um, you can use this I think to to manage
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.720]   You know how you get the places on public transportation
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.440]   I'm not taking taking a look at the app itself, but
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.960]   Uh, that is coming to more places. That's because it's iOS only. Oh, oh, I see how it is one of those google apps
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.080]   That's iOS only you can sign up no sense. I could sign up for the
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:31.600]   Yes, there is an android waiting list. Yes. Okay. Wha wah. Well, that would explain it. Thank you karshen
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.760]   Uh google created a new rewards program for the play store called google play points
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.400]   This is something that they actually launched last year in a couple of markets japan and then uh earlier this year in south korea
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.960]   Now they're bringing it to us you can sign up for free redeem play points for
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:56.000]   Play store credit items discounts in certain games or even donating points to various and non-profits
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.880]   That sort of stuff. So how do they use them?
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:05.120]   Great question. I have no idea what they would do with those points if they apps and games and stuff. Yeah
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.600]   Staying walls. Oh, no
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.240]   Breaking news
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:17.120]   Alphabet's board of directors is investigating executives over inappropriate relationships
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:25.680]   Published 11 minutes ago the board of google's parent company alphabet is conducting an investigation into sexual misconduct by executives and has hired a law firm to assist
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.160]   Does it say which executives
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.560]   Uh it encompasses behavior by alphabet chief legal officer david drummond
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.240]   Yeah, that's been out there for quite a bit. We knew about that. So this is basically
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.680]   I'm reading this as I'm there doing something where where is the story?
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.760]   Uh, this is on cnbc. So it's a legit source
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.120]   Yeah, yeah, no, I was I didn't doubt you
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.000]   I was like it's legit or feels legit. It's four. Okay. Sorry
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.280]   We can we can move on
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.720]   I thought it was everybody besides uh drummond
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.360]   So it says executives so someone girl, but
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.960]   Yeah
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   Oh could get interesting
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.520]   The company paid him 47 million dollars last year
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.160]   Wow. Yeah
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.560]   Yeah, wowza. So it does say
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.040]   browser
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.160]   plural, but it does not give you any other names. So
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   It could be investigating how other executives
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:35.520]   handled oh I see to handle the case. Well, no, it says investigation into sexual misconduct by executives plural
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.240]   Does that include the person that he was
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:44.960]   They wouldn't they wouldn't include that other person because it was they were not sexually misconducting exactly right?
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.440]   That is that is not
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.680]   Those are not just out here. Miss conducting
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:59.360]   Yes, verb of honor. Okay. All right breaking news. All right
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   Okay
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:10.400]   Google into something a little less salacious google photos for android is is updating
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.160]   To allow for our boring world. Yes, exactly
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.440]   Frame export from videos. So if you find a part of a video that you want to pull a frame from
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.120]   Uh, they're now updating the interface in the android app
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.400]   Uh, it'll be integrated into the video editor
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.600]   Functionality and there'll be like a little button that you can say export this frame or whatever
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.160]   So if you want to make a picture out of a frame from your video, that's basically what this is all about
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.200]   It is a server side switch. So
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.680]   You know, you might have it. You might not
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.360]   Apparently it's coming to everybody
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.520]   Also updating is the google camera 7.2 app that pixel 4 has had since launch
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.440]   Uh, you know, it's very redesigned now. It's rolling out to older pixels
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.200]   Big interface changes there a new social sharing option, which is actually really useful when you take a picture
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.560]   You get this little like
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.200]   Pill-shaped thing with a preview of the picture
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.320]   And then this little button that when you tap it it has a couple of like your social services that you could just
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.280]   Share right to from there. I've used it a couple of times. It's really nice that it's streamlined like that
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.920]   It doesn't really get in the way or anything. So that's pretty neat. Also the astrophotography
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.920]   Stuff
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.600]   Updates to night site will be included there and apparently burst mode
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.440]   Which we know is going away. It's it's gone and this is well
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.120]   So if you like burst mode, do I care about astrophotography?
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.000]   I don't know you ever want to take a picture of the stars
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.600]   No
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.520]   So then probably not you can also do cool light painting stuff with it
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.000]   Well, that's true
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.800]   It's basically holding open the iris of the camera
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.760]   You can do a lot of the enough light to I'm in New York
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.240]   We can't see stars because earth is so bright
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.960]   You could do cool really cool traffic photos like with the the streaks
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.160]   Going by because it's true. It holds the the
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:05.760]   Basically, it's just something that holds the shutter open for one minute. Right. Okay. You can get some cool
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.400]   Effects that way. Yeah, thank you
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.680]   Yep
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.200]   Is well stuff there
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   Google News is going to show stories
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:19.920]   For up to two languages now support for multiple or bilingual feeds essentially in regions of interest
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.320]   Um, you can tap on your profile image in the upper right corner
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.560]   Go to settings languages and regions of interest and add a language and region and then your feed will have
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.680]   Multiple languages or at least two anyways
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.560]   Um kind of integrated into one so that's a nice feature
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.840]   Google Maps is adding
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.800]   Or has added in the process of adding large landmark attraction icons into maps
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.560]   So if there's something like the golden gate bridge or whatever you're looking at a map
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.160]   And it's an attraction that the many people would go to it's going to be called out
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.640]   with a uh special icon
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:03.200]   That looks like they kind of do a little doodle of what the actual attraction looks like so it's not just like a
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.560]   A red dot or something. Um, it actually looks different from everything else on the map and
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.280]   Make it easier to find them
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:19.600]   Also in maps we've talked about incognito rolling out to the maps on android devices and that's actually rolling out now so
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.960]   um, you know that that cuts off any sort of tracking or or logging of
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:31.360]   Wherever you happen to be going or navigating to when you're in incognito as you would expect and that's rolling out
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.080]   And then finally
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.840]   I added this one
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.160]   Yeah, so I think this was yes
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.560]   The recorder app the neat recorder app that's on the pixel 4
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.360]   Is now heading to older pixel phones
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.240]   I don't know if it's rolling out quite yet because I don't know if we have a date
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.120]   No, not quite necessarily, but it's going to happen
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.680]   um if you
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.680]   I wouldn't put it in my review
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.120]   but
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.520]   I want it yesterday. You can say I don't want it to
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.600]   Yeah, I was gonna say it's pretty easy to add this you can already get it
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.960]   Go to APK mirror calm and you can get the APK and install it side load it
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.920]   I hate so Jason now that you've had the four for a week
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.720]   Um still liking not liking carrying
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.960]   Cup I yeah, so I guess I'm a couple of weeks into it in a couple of weeks. Oh, yeah, and um
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.440]   I've been asking myself that question. I mean there there aren't a whole lot of things
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.960]   About this phone that I'm like, oh man. You gotta check this out. You know what I mean like it's
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.920]   Between the pixel three and the pixel four. There's there's really not a whole lot of differences outside of let's say the solely
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.880]   Thing but even that like how are they use it?
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.040]   Um, I don't go hold on to my three. I activated
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:51.280]   I went in the developer settings and activated 90 Hertz to like just like put it on and force it on and see
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.160]   How much of a difference it makes and I mean it's it's really nice
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.520]   But I could very easily keep that off and you probably won't notice the majority of the time that things are
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.680]   You know as smooth as they ever were prior to 90 Hertz being a thing
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.080]   So I feel like some of the major
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:13.920]   Revisions on this phone are need to have but not have to have that makes sense. Okay. Thank you
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.920]   I don't think it's a little bit. I don't think it's a little stop great if you've got the go instead. Yes
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.320]   Yeah, I would I would say that might be the better bet. Um, it's not a bad phone either
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.560]   It's not a bad phone. It's expensive for what you get that he sees Bobby
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.160]   I'm sorry. I was like all fidgety. It's I got stuck. Yo caught me on camera
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.560]   Was this the point where you had to stand up?
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560]   It was all through the stacy bob
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:41.840]   But I was just like oh my gosh. I have the dance all all the kids are doing come on Jason. Let's do the stacy bob
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:47.520]   Something like this. Maybe like that. Oh, oh, oh, what is happening here? I don't know
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:53.440]   You tell me to dance. There's only certain dances that I could do sitting down, but you want to see me boogie
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.400]   We stand up, but that's not for now. That's that's for. I was like, I want to see you
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.720]   Yeah, I want to see that. Yes, I would like that very much. Thank you. I am very much over promising on what I could actually deliver
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:10.800]   Let's take a break and then we'll come back. We'll do tips tricks numbers all that fun stuff and round out this show
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.480]   Uh, but first let's talk a little bit about Taylor store. They are the sponsor of this week in tech Taylor store is
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:21.360]   Awesome. I'm a tall individual. It's not easy for me to find clothes that fit
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.600]   That's why I like Taylor store because their clothes are made to fit
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:31.680]   They offer high quality made to order dress shirts for both men and women that are fully customizable and tailored
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.760]   To your measurements as a 100 carb and neutral business
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:41.280]   Taylor store challenges the traditional fashion industry with its new way to purchase clothes
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:48.080]   Ready made garments and author exercises have no place in the modern world. They rarely work for me to be honest
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.720]   People are individuals and Taylor store embraces individualism
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:59.280]   Uh, there are virtually endless options to choose from they have a selection of finished designs that can be directly purchased
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.760]   Or what's really cool about Taylor store?
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:06.960]   You can use those designs as a starting point for your own customization when i'm talking about customization
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.920]   You can get super detailed with how you want these these shirts these clothes to be designed
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.840]   They're perfect fit guarantee takes away the risk of ordering
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:21.440]   If your shirt does not fit you as you would like they will remake it for free
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.560]   All you have to do is just snap a couple of pictures if you wearing the shirt that you received
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.080]   They make the necessary adjustments and they send you a new shirt
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.960]   super quickly at no cost
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:39.200]   And the best part there are no returns. So that means that faulty shirt that you received first is yours to keep
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.360]   Um, so hey, you have another shirt. Maybe it doesn't fit as perfectly as the other one
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.600]   You can wear it or you can give it to charity whatever you want to do. You're not returning that shirt
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.640]   Taylor store has a size me app which revolutionizes the measurement process using advanced technology and
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:59.120]   Algorithms so you aren't pulling out a tape measure and like how it would you know?
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.480]   How am I measuring the neck and the sleeve and all this kind of stuff? You don't have to do that
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:10.080]   Um, no other hassles like that you just download the app and you let their algorithm precisely calculate your clothing measurements
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:17.120]   It takes just seconds and again. I used this it worked really well my the I received the shirt initially
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:22.400]   And it actually it fit the way I had described but I realized like I know I didn't get any tapering
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.040]   In the in the body and so it wasn't as slim as I liked so I contacted them
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.880]   They you know, I sent the two pictures. They sent me a replacement
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:37.280]   I kept the first shirt and I have a revised version of that shirt that fits me slimly and
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.160]   Couldn't be happier gone are the days when custom made to measure shirts were an item of luxury wherever you are
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.760]   Look and feel your very best in perfect clothes made only for you by Taylor store

[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.920]   We thank taylor store for their support of this week in google
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.280]   All right before
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.440]   Jason how you have the shirt that fits you and you have one Ellen ready for the middle age spread
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:35.120]   Yes, exactly a couple years down the line that's like sure it's gonna come in really handy
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.160]   Exactly. Just maybe maybe in January after the holidays you never know possible
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:44.720]   Yeah, you know, I'll keep throwing it on it. I'll be and I'll be a little depressed when it fits
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.440]   When it fits. I'll know I have failed
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.200]   Um
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.880]   Jeff you were going back and forth on a number before the show so i'm gonna throw you
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.360]   So kevin toffle came to the rescue as he does with everything he sent me a message
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.000]   300 is the number. No, that's how many topics you'll be able to follow on
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.800]   Twitter as they shift to an ability to follow topics not just people that's a good point
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:14.480]   That's right. So apparently this has been like I you know, I know I've heard people
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.880]   Wanting something like this along the way and I guess twitter has been kind of
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:25.920]   Wondering how they're gonna implement a feature like this for a long time and they finally have it 300 topics to start with
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.920]   um
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.920]   tweets from accounts
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:35.280]   Uh from people with credibility on those particular topics whether you follow them or not
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.680]   So it's gonna be kind of a stream based on topic and you probably aren't following a lot of the people in there
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.120]   Maybe you end up following them because you like that person or whatever, but that's a neat feature. I like the idea that
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.840]   I've actually talked to jack about this and he also wants to emphasize being able to
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.960]   Figure out how to insert expertise into these things
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.440]   So you follow topics from people who are good
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.080]   And I like that idea. Oh, huh
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.160]   You could just follow my list if you want like super wireless radio nerds
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.760]   Oh, I have I have a media
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.880]   Ai nerds wireless radio nerds. Do you both use the twitter list? I remember using a whole years ago and I I just
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.480]   I just I just um
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.360]   Those are the people I follow. Yeah, okay
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.000]   I you list is your followers or the people absolutely fault though. I have um
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:32.160]   One if you're if you're really boring, uh, then media walks is one of them. Mm-hmm. And then another one is um
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.640]   Trump watchers
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:40.480]   Oh, that sounds like a delightful. That's what I use more than anything else actually. It's it's it's you know around that news
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.760]   Okay, um, then I have a campaign 2020 which has a lot of all the candidates and their major
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.880]   staff people in the democratic side
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.400]   Um, and then I have a trump conspiracy one where they're kind of farther out trump watchers are
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.520]   Wow, he's you use the the list feature. I love the way it was intended
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.240]   Yeah, I stopped using it. I used it a long time ago, and then I just kind of stopped
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:13.280]   Uh, well cool topics rolling out. That's a good thing. I think for twitter stacey. What's your thing? Oh?
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.840]   All right this week
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.280]   Sorry
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   control for
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.440]   launch a brand new device
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:30.400]   They acquired a company in 2019 called neo and I had last seen neo's hardware at ces in 2017
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.600]   And I was super excited by it and it was a remote control to integrate your diy smart home stuff
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:42.880]   And it was gorgeous control for bought it and basically they have now turned it into a gorgeous remote control for control for
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.520]   So i'm going to show that briefly to you so you can see what a beautiful
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:52.240]   remote control experience looks like and I also learned that control for now
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.200]   Really you can build a system that works with a lot of your other stuff for about
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.560]   $2,000 at a very minimal which gets you the hub
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.600]   this particular remote control and
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:11.920]   It works with other stuff too like your nest your hue lights and other things so no's etc. So here's the remote control
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.640]   Is very skitty is very pretty its capacitive touch up here
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   there it is and
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.840]   It's nice
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.920]   I don't know what I mean. I don't know what else to say. I just thought
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:32.480]   It's worth seeing the remote control because it it kind of reminds me of the the phone design that Andy Rubin tweeted the super long format
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.800]   Yeah, it really did
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.200]   Now I can't even see it
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.040]   Because I don't have a control for system that I have with this is the charging
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.800]   Puck
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.960]   Is not both ways so it's not like lightning and if you flip me
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:54.240]   So this thing is huge and you're supposed to like stick the remote in but you have to stick it the right way where it won't stay
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.040]   And that makes me sad. Yeah
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.440]   Seems like this is a $600 remote and it's magnetized. I love magnets snaps right in
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.040]   Does it do you feel a magnetic rejection when you put it in the wrong way?
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:13.200]   So at least like you don't think it's in there and just like leave and it falls no it just falls over just falls over
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.240]   Oh, oh look
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.000]   I can't make it sit up straight if I do like this, but it won't be charging
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.680]   Um, it doesn't actually fit. There's only confusing them. Yeah
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.240]   Yeah, it is it is but
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.760]   So that that was my one beef with this whole thing and this thing y'all
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.320]   I could kill a man if I threw this at his head. I mean it is heavy
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:39.440]   Wow, sorry not that you're angry today. Yeah, don't throw that at anyone. I'm not I'm not angry
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.960]   But it's got a it's got a good heft to it. Is there anything you want to talk about?
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.960]   Love it right now. What was the name of that again?
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:56.080]   Is the this is the neo remote from control for and control it is beautiful nice
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.200]   What's the remote loan cost?
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.440]   $600 oh, wow
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:09.120]   Yeah, I wish they had sent me the silver one because the black one I feel like you cannot get a sense of how smooth and cute and fun
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.640]   This is it is a very like it is a nice piece of hardware
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:18.320]   I have the harmony remote and this is much nicer feeling in your hand. Yeah. Yeah, it looks nice
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:27.840]   Um, my tip is actually from twit.com unity if you didn't know we have a community page or a forum actually now twit.com unity
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.640]   Bill bowling on there in response to I love that this came from I
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.560]   Love it
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.760]   from last week when we were talking about getting your history on
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:47.120]   On things that you do. I don't know if you have my overhead shot, but um on things that you do inside where is
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.240]   Oh, there it is. Okay
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:53.840]   I'll do this. Okay when you have a query down in this
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.280]   Oops not there in this little google bar down at the bottom
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.160]   We were trying to figure out like how do you get your history and I was like, oh, yeah
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.440]   Well, you know, you just you go there and then open and chrome of all blonde
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.120]   You guys sounded a little let down that that wasn't a really
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:13.600]   You know, it wasn't quite the ideal way to get that history well bill and then twit.com unity followed through
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.240]   Uh, basically you touch the g
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.040]   And then you touch the g
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.240]   And then you get this interface right down here is recent
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.280]   recent
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.640]   Bill
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:33.120]   You can see my head that yeah, I know it's not the easiest thing
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   It takes a couple of taps, but it is there
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.120]   And that's good because I mean like sometimes you're like really bummed
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.160]   So when I'm really bummed I'm gonna be like I'm gonna hit my G
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.680]   I'm gonna hit my G again and then I'm gonna hit recent and then I'm gonna be like thanks bill
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.000]   Every time you do it make sure and say a thanks bill out loud and hula. Oh, you know, I will
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.360]   So what's this other stuff so so go to the more there go back to that
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.320]   More there's other things like collections and interests. I've never seen

[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   Oh
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.840]   My interests are all wack
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.480]   I don't have any interests. I'm boring
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.720]   You may have told google you don't want to keep it

[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.920]   It totally follows your searches because mine are things like
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:52.240]   Things I've clicked on in the news and things like leggings which I know I've googled or
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.120]   That's not my interest
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:02.800]   I kind of appreciate my hidden area which apparently I've I've hidden a bunch of things that I don't want to see including Justin Bieber
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.240]   Donald Trump
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.120]   NBA
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.880]   Oh, yeah, I don't have any hidden but I know why I get all the time
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.000]   the apprentice
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.760]   Yeah, so apparently there are things and I think these were a lot of these were in the the news feed things would come up
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.520]   And it's like dude. I just I don't care about that. I don't want to read about that every single day
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.320]   Why is this appearing in my news feed not interested in it puts it there?
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.600]   So I keep telling it that but it has not put any in there
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.000]   But it apparently knows that I am interested in Colin Joest and Michael Che
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.360]   There's a frozen - there's a lot of things. I'm not interested in most many of which I don't even know who they are
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.720]   Mark tevis Bryant
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.960]   Interesting manta. I don't know who these people are. That's interesting. I don't like them obviously
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:43:00.800]   You're you're not interested is very interesting. Oh my gosh. I found it. Oh, I'm not interested in Avengers Infinity War bill O'Reilly
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.680]   the Boston Bruins
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.680]   The British royal family
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.560]   It's fun to see what you're not interested in
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.720]   I love it. That's a fun game
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.440]   Just be careful before you play that game. You might not want people to know what you're not interested in
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.880]   Also has a category for spoilers. Oh, does it? So it won't show you you can tell it
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.840]   Uh, if you've hit if you start hiding spoilers, it'll remember that and you
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.120]   So it won't show you spoilers for things. That's kind of cool
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.520]   That is just in beavers in my hidden interest too. Okay, not mine. Thanks
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.400]   Because not just me
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.880]   And I know why that was it was god. It was on one show. I did a search for Justin Bieber
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:50.000]   And then ever since that show I would get like things in the feed about what Justin Bieber was up to
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.720]   I'm like dude. I don't care about it was a show joke
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.760]   I don't care about Justin Bieber and yet he would reappear. So hidden worked
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:03.520]   I have no I have no idea what Justin Bieber is up to and I'm happy about that. He married. Hey, how's no?
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.280]   Haley, Haley Baldwin a Baldwin daughter. Oh, okay. Now you know now I know
