[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Twink this week in Google and Pruitt's back. Stacey Higginbotham's here.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.160]   Jeff Jarvis too. We're going to talk about Amazon. They just bought the entire film catalog of MGM.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.120]   What are they going to do with it? And is it a trust violation? Amazon's being sued by the
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.720]   DC Attorney General because its prices are too high. Biden's White House says their prices are too low.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.360]   Which is it? And Charlie Bitmafinga. It's a good thing he wasn't holding the piece of blue cheese.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:40.240]   Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Twig.

[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show where we talk about everything but Google most of
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.200]   time. But there's going to be a little Google talk today. @proit has made his way back having
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.280]   recovered from a sequel injection. Yeah, we missed you. So glad to be back sir. Good grief.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.640]   Sounds like that second shot. Was that Pfizer Moderna? What did you get?
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   I do not remember. It doesn't matter. Look on your passport. Make sure you have your
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.160]   keep that card now. Don't lose that. Don't laminate.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.640]   That I do have is somewhere on this messy desk of mine. But I do have that.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.800]   I actually have put mine in a lanyard so I can hang it around my neck.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.280]   Because I feel like when I've had travel, I'm going to need to demonstrate it.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.240]   And you suffered for it so you should definitely flaunt it. Great.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.920]   There it is. This right here on my desk. Don't show it to us. I'm not sure.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   No, it's secret. It's great to have you back. Welcome back.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.080]   Thank you, sir. And also here with us, ladies and gentlemen, from the Fine.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.960]   I got to reach over here. I still memorize this. Leonard Tow Professor for journalistic
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.520]   innovation at the... Craig.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.160]   Graduates, Philip Jones, and the City University of New York. Mr. Jeff Jarvis,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   former TV guide critic buzz machine.com. Great to have you.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.280]   Founder of Entertainment Weekly. Right? That's an important title.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.960]   Oh, I didn't know you were a founder of Entertainment Weekly. Is that
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.400]   Entertainment Weekly still around? Surprisingly, yes.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.440]   Yeah. Okay. No, I just like, who knows? Sometimes we just call it you.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   You@EW.com. It's still around. That beautiful voice is, of course,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.080]   the wonderful Stacey Higabotham. Now via fiber, Stacey on IOT.com. God, the shot looks so good.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.120]   All the pictures. Really? I feel like I look blurry.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.600]   No, no. You're crystal clear. We've got you turned on 1080p now on our Zoom connection,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   and you're on fiber. So you're sending us enough bits to tell what's out your window.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.440]   Oh, the bits. Oh, can you see my rotis?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.480]   Oh, is that what those are out there? Roto Dendrens?
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yeah. Nice. I don't know how to say the word.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   I see the flower in front of it. What is that in front of the face? Is it a fern?
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.320]   That's a dragon tree. Dragon tree. But yeah, out the window are my rotis,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   and they are freaking gorgeous. What did they blossom? What did they bloom? Are they blooming?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.640]   Right now. I have like seven, they're native to the area, so they're like 10
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.680]   roti trees. Oh, that's nice. Like around my house, and they're all different colors.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   Can you? We go out. Why don't you go out now and carry the camera with you?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.320]   We could all really? No, I'm just kidding. I was like, I will.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560]   I wish we could. We're going to lose the fiber.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   No, no, no, that's not worth losing the fiber.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.440]   Fair. I can show you the here we go. Ready? I'll see if I can get you a closer.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   Yeah, because the light is brighter out there, so we don't see the color. Are they yellow?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   Yeah, I can't actually get my color.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.520]   Just didn't dispose for the highlights. Oh, I do see them. There we go.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.680]   Oh, I see it. Beautiful.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.720]   Literally rose tree from the Latin Rodon rose and dendron tree, the rodo dendron
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:53.040]   tree Greek. Sorry, not Latin. Thank you. No, I don't know, but they're freaking gorgeous.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   They're a little showy for me though.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.880]   They are. There's like five of these things. They're just like poof.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.480]   Oh, I'm so jealous. It's nice and native though.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.920]   You didn't have to plant them. They just, they're there. They came with it.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.120]   They just live here. Came with the house. That's really nice.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.760]   Look at there. Here's a picture from Wikipedia so we can see what the pink looks like.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.240]   It likes swamp. What? Really? They like swamp. They like wet wet.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.080]   Oh, well, you're on an island. I guess it's damp.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.480]   Well, I'll see. I'm seeing the animals.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.280]   I'm seeing the animals.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.840]   It's nice.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.280]   Somebody, somebody call me to ask me about that helium thing you have.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.120]   And I mentioned that you make money on helium. It's the people's network. It generates Bitcoin
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.480]   while you share your Wi-Fi. It does not generate Bitcoin. Generates helium,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.560]   blockchain, helium network tokens. Yeah.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.080]   He said his friend said he was earning 30 bucks a day. He lives in LA.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.480]   He was wondering if he would make that much. I said, well, I think
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   Stacy makes like 30 bucks a month from passing ships, but then she lives on an island.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   Oh, no, dude. Some days it varies based on the day, but right now,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.040]   oh, today is not a high earning day, but some days I make like
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.680]   70 or 100 bucks. What?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.200]   Okay. Really? The other day?
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.800]   Well, it just depends on the day. It depends on the market too, right?
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.400]   Well, yeah, it depends on the value of the coins.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.120]   Like right now, what it is. Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.760]   That's a good point.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.400]   So you get a fraction of a helium coin whenever anybody
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.080]   uses. Is it internet access you give them or what is it?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.640]   I'm giving them internet access. So I'm sending data using my Wi-Fi as a bat call.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.000]   So that's what I'm doing.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.600]   But you have enough bandwidth now with your fiber that you can do that.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.960]   Is it is it? Well, it's low bandwidth. They're using Laura.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.800]   So it's a very low data rate. Okay. So it's no, no, no skin off your nose, as one might say.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   Yeah. It's a horrible metaphor.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.000]   So and then you make money based on the bits or how does it convert?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.880]   I make money mining new coins.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.440]   So there's money for mining new coins.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   There's money for being as a for acting as a witness for other miners nearby.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.800]   Proof of stake or proof of work.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.840]   Proof of stake, right.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.320]   Proof of stake.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   And then I earn money for...
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.360]   Actually, it's proof.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.320]   They call it proof of coverage, which is wild.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.240]   Well, it is. I mean, it's basically like, is there still a thing here?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.800]   Have you converted it to dollars yet?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.840]   Yes. So I've converted about $15,000 to dollars.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.760]   $15,000 to dollars?
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.520]   Yes.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.480]   Holy moly.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   And then like right...
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.280]   Where can I get one of these?
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.400]   That's awesome.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.600]   They're all accurate.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.000]   So the IRS will know.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.200]   So it's really a pain in the butt to like calculate this.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.080]   There's actually an interesting lawsuit today.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.440]   So yeah.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.200]   So right now I've got 317 Helio network tokens that I've mined since probably...
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.440]   I don't know how long...
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.800]   Like the last two or three months.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.760]   That's phenomenal.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.480]   Those are now...
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.880]   That's phenomenal.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.440]   $4,700 because right now Helium is trading at $14.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.800]   Nice.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.080]   But when you...
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.280]   The tax implications are kind of a pain because what happens is
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.080]   you are taxed based on the value of the tokens,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.800]   and this is all cryptocurrencies, when they are mined.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.320]   So you have to know how much you mined, what they were worth,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   when they were mined.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.600]   Not on when you converted it to dollars,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.160]   but when you mined it, when you earned them.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.400]   And when you sell them.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.200]   Oh, well, so the basis is what it costs to mine them.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.480]   And then...
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.360]   Well, it's both.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   You pay tax on which, on the difference or the...
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.200]   You pay taxes on both.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.080]   You pay taxes on the value that you're mining.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.280]   So there's actually a lawsuit that was filed,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.920]   was it today or yesterday, by somebody saying,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.160]   "Hey, look, you should just tax crypto when it's sold."
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.640]   Yeah, that's crazy because you're double taxed, basically.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.760]   Double dip.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   Double dip.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.160]   Well, they're trying to discourage it.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.840]   Maybe that's...
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.000]   So I'm looking at the coverage map,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.400]   and yeah, there's a lot of Seattle Helium users.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.240]   It's very popular.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.600]   Yeah, and you want to have a couple...
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.920]   You make more money.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   If there's other...
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.400]   You have things near you.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.080]   Because then you get the proof of coverage stuff.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.400]   This is really interesting.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.760]   I wonder, I should look at the map down our way,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.880]   because I wouldn't want to do it if there weren't a lot of people.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.120]   See, it's not real big and...
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.000]   Well...
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.680]   You don't need a lot.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.880]   I mean, and it's long, right?
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.160]   Oh, this is just this petaluma.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight petaluma.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.040]   Do it, but you can't get the...
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.440]   Yeah, I bet not with...
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.560]   After what you just said,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.400]   you're never going to be able to get them.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.280]   Holy cow!
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.800]   Well, they've been backordered,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   but so the other thing is,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.000]   I mean, I'm not doing it like...
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.760]   I didn't do this to make money.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.960]   I did this because I was like,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.560]   "Lauren networks are fun!"
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.440]   Yeah, yeah, but...
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.200]   It's the same reason I turned on Amazon.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.920]   Yeah, bonus.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.240]   So...
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.960]   Right.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.160]   So that's an interesting...
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.000]   Now, that's another one that the radio show we go back and forth about,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.720]   "Should I leave my sidewalk on, or should I disable it?"
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.600]   It is going to be turned on any day now by the...
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.560]   Yeah, leave it on.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.600]   I mean... I think so.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.720]   I've turned it back together.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.040]   Yes!
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.120]   Okay, remember, you were going to have Steve Gibson look at it.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.120]   I don't control Steve Gibson in any possible way.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.160]   If I could...
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.200]   I know I know, but...
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   I can ask.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.440]   The sidewalk protocol that's running on top of the...
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.200]   It's either Bluetooth or Laura radios.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.160]   It can work on both.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   Is Amazon doesn't see your packets.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.720]   The device company doesn't see your packets.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.360]   So it's all...
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.720]   They're not looking at the data and the things
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.280]   attaching to your network and the things that attach
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.120]   and use the sidewalk network can't get into your actual network.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.760]   So it's a really secure protocol.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.400]   So...
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.640]   And it's providing this awesome service.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.280]   Now, if your...
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.720]   Issue is that you're like, "Screw Amazon.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.960]   I'm not giving them anything for free?"
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.840]   Then yes.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.800]   Then turn it off.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.880]   But what you're going to be doing is helping all of these companies
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.840]   that want to have a long range, low power, cheap IoT network.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.280]   They're going to use the sidewalk.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.320]   There's a huge benefit.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   By the way, Steve did cover it in security now 796 last December.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.920]   And his final conclusion was thumbs up.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   He says, "Well, we'll need to survive deeper analysis
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.360]   by cryptographers and academic analysts."
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.840]   Sure.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.960]   "Amazon has clearly worked to create and deliver a state-of-the-art
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.280]   secure messaging solution.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.680]   If this were to succeed, we might be in a world
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.840]   where a cool low frequency, low bandwidth,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.880]   low data rate message passing network was everywhere.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.080]   In this world, previously registered devices could roam
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.960]   free laywire remaining able to send and receive status updates
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.400]   and command messages."
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   So he was bullish.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.520]   He did, in fact, read the white paper.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.920]   I remember this now and talk about it.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.160]   And he was very positive about it.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.760]   In fact, he changed my mind on it.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.040]   So which...
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.640]   You are just debating this.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   Just two questions.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.440]   Which router do you recommend in this case?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.360]   In second, not that I would do this, but I live on the burbs.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.160]   I'm not going to work out here.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.520]   If I went to my office and just said,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.320]   "I'm going to plug this into the ethernet at the office.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.000]   Can I start my...
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.320]   The burbs are probably...
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:24.880]   The burbs are probably in office school?
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.880]   Yes, but the burbs are actually probably a better place to do it.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.080]   I mean, if there's too much coverage in one place,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.120]   you're going to earn less.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.160]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.560]   So Petalomo is perfect because there's eight.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.360]   Right.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.520]   Because there's some there, but there's not...
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.320]   But there's not two minutes.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.640]   But you can't get one, so good luck.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.080]   Yeah, you can't get one.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.160]   Kevin's ordered one back in January.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.400]   Do you go on the wait of those four?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.280]   Any of them are going to be the same.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.240]   So here's the choice.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.520]   Hardware is the same.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.320]   Here's the choice.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.400]   There's the RAK hotspot minor,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.720]   the NEMBRA HNT outdoor hotspot minor,
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.880]   the Bobcat minor.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.840]   Which one do you have?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.880]   Well, I have the helium one they made,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.200]   but I would say any of these...
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.080]   All of these are fine.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.760]   It just kind of depends on your goals.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.520]   Like if you want to do like...
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.360]   The outdoor hotspot minor is interesting
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.680]   because you can cover a larger area,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.600]   because you could stick it like outside on a pole.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.400]   But I would just pick the one that seemed to have the least backlog.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.760]   They are saying...
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.560]   Shipping batch three.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.320]   They're on batch four, it looks like.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.280]   I can't tell.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.200]   It does say sold out.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.800]   So the button is not...
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.760]   You can't even order it.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.000]   You can't even order it on this, on the NEMBRA.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.920]   Let's look at the RAK.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.560]   That's that gigastacy effect.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.240]   Yeah, it's all your fault.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.920]   Oh, no, no.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.280]   This was sold out way before,
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.720]   like I wrote anything about it.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.560]   I mean, Kevin ordered his in January
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.200]   and his keeps...
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.240]   It was supposed to come in May
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.480]   and it's getting pushed back again by another month.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.680]   Due to unprecedented demand for the RAC hotspot minor V2,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.800]   we are limiting the number of units
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   can be purchased to 250 per day.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   So you sign up for their Discord server,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.800]   and the message goes out in the morning
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.680]   to let everyone know
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.480]   that the selections for the day have been made
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.520]   and to check your email.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.400]   Also, you...
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.000]   They're basically doing a lottery.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.720]   It's a lottery.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.120]   You can order the Bobcat.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.160]   Can you?
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.520]   Yep.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.640]   I'll order it right now.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.120]   This is...
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.480]   I want to make $15,000.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:28.560]   Oh, this is...
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.080]   What are they doing?
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.040]   I can put it in my Bitcoin all night.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.520]   This is not real money.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.960]   There's no ration...
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.120]   There's no rational reason for this.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.920]   I just...
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.880]   The Bobcats, the people's minor.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.400]   Oh, it's...
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:40.960]   It's...
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.720]   It's your North America.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.680]   Let's see.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.400]   Buy it now.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.800]   I'm gonna...
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   Hell yeah.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.120]   I agree.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.400]   Choose the right frequency.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.840]   Watch this video.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.040]   Do not under or overpay the processing fee.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.560]   Oh, there's a processing fee?
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.840]   I don't know what that means.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.600]   I don't...
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.960]   Space is gonna keep this.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.000]   Sounds like means.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.520]   Ethereum gas charges.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.960]   You go ahead and do the show while I...
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   Check this out.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.400]   I don't know what to tell you.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.800]   Do you know anything about the Bobcat?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.760]   I know all of these companies like
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.600]   Nebra was formed specifically.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.640]   They were a spin-out of a contract manufacturer in the UK
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.840]   to specifically to make helium routers.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.720]   That's all they do.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.040]   Rack and Bobcat both...
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.000]   Make others...
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.760]   Bobcats owned by CalArts.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   Oh, I love CalArts.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.200]   That's a...
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.280]   Bobcat, I believe, is their brand, CalArts.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.440]   CalArts like the college?
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.680]   They want me to pay with something called Muggle Pay.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.960]   What the hell's Muggle Pay?
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.920]   That's cryptocurrency.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.880]   I could pay in the USDC or USDT Muggle Pay.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.640]   What the hell is that?
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   Do not underpay or overpay the processing fee.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.200]   How would I even know?
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.320]   I swear it just sounds like a...
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.360]   Cryptocurrency.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.640]   Ocouchhip, I'm sorry.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.200]   Calchhip.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   That's different from CalArts, which is a university.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.520]   Yes, I know.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   Okay, that's okay.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.560]   You see my confusion though.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.600]   I certainly do.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.120]   How would I know if I were underpaying or overpaying?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.360]   I don't know.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:21.840]   Like I...
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.680]   Oh, this guy really complicated.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.440]   I bought...
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.640]   Mine is from...
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.720]   It looks like I have to pay from a Muggle Pay wallet.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   Oh my god.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   Or...
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.840]   God, I don't even...
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.160]   This is...
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.880]   No, by that one.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.240]   I don't understand this at all.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.280]   This website is confusing the heck out of me.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.880]   It's CrayCray, USDT.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.400]   This is so crypto.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.040]   Man, I feel like I'm in the 28th century, man.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.760]   So you get to choose what wallet you're using.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.920]   This is CrayCray.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.960]   Oh, and to avoid the people who are individually asking me
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.400]   how you transfer your...
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.960]   Yeah, how do you cash in your...
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.440]   Helium.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.840]   I did it on Binance.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   Binance doesn't work in all states.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.320]   Binance is also now under federal investigation.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.480]   Oh, really?
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.960]   Besee.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.120]   Let me...
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.040]   This is looking worse and worse and worse.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.600]   B&B.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.840]   That...
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.880]   I'm telling you...
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.360]   This is...
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.720]   This is journalism right here.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.680]   This is me telling you...
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.720]   That's why I want to do it.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.520]   Journalism.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.080]   All the...
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.680]   Plus $50,000.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.320]   You're in a weird tax scheme
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.800]   where you can only pay using odd things
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.880]   and you can only get it using odd things.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.840]   I don't know, Stacey.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.440]   I don't know.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.560]   I paid money to get mine.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.640]   So, like, I don't understand how like...
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.920]   Well, this sounds...
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.080]   Bobcats created for you to earn more.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.920]   It's a high-efficiency minor hotspot for HNT.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.120]   Compatible with Helium Longfi and architecture.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.080]   It's also compatible with all low-run devices.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.040]   Five watts, signal range, 10 miles.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.480]   That's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.440]   It goes 10 miles.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.120]   So, that's why those people are trying to buy that.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.240]   I mean, because the difference is basically the greater your coverage,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   more you can earn on minor.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.280]   So, the outdoor...
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.960]   I guess the buy...
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.440]   So, yeah.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.320]   All right.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.760]   Well, I won't buy it right now.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.400]   Oh, you're not even if you do, you're not getting it for months.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.640]   I have to get a muggle wallet.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.400]   What the hell is a muggle wallet?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.240]   Yeah, Calchip makes that one.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.160]   But, Nebras sounds like it was designed specifically for this.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.080]   I'll get on the wait list.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.960]   We'll see what happens.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.880]   Meanwhile, how's your road at entrance?
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.760]   No, no, that's something else.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.960]   Big story.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.040]   Just broke.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   Kisha.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:47.040]   Amazon has purchased MGM for $9 billion.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.280]   That's good.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.560]   8.45.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.440]   Oh, all right.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.480]   8.45.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.200]   Including debt and pending, of course, regulatory approval.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   So, Jeff, you're old enough to remember the 1920s.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.760]   Just teasing.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.360]   But you maybe do remember a very famous anti-trust case
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.680]   because the movie studios in the early days of motion pictures
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.640]   owned the theaters, the movie theaters.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.120]   So, they had absolute control, not only the content, but of the distribution.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.200]   And they were forced to divest.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   This sounds exactly like a movie studio
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.120]   owning the means of distribution, Amazon Prime.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.640]   Well, Comcast.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.240]   Well, what about Disney Plus?
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.000]   Well, I guess this now is the thing.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.720]   Comcast and NBCU.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.760]   They're all allowed to do that.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:39.920]   Well, no.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.280]   Well, so when Comcast bought NBC,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.360]   Universal Universal Studios.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.720]   They actually, the FCC, put a bunch of conditions on the transaction,
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.400]   including things like, "Hey, you have to invest in minority cable channels,"
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.440]   which they did and nobody watched them.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.560]   So, there were a bunch of conditions.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.160]   Those are all done with now, but so it's possible.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   And this was the US versus Paramount Pictures.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.200]   The real problem was exclusivity rights.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.640]   So, the theaters that Paramount owned only could show Paramount movies
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.240]   and no one else could show Paramount movies and things like that.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.840]   And the Supreme Court agreed it went on for you.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.720]   What year was that case?
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.720]   It ended up being 1948 was the final Supreme Court decision.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   So, you do remember this.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.360]   Oh, so you were a live chef.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.600]   If you all, if you all.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.640]   It's very, it's famous.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.720]   It's prematurely gray, damn it.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.160]   So, do you think it was?
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:49.600]   Do you think, I guess we live in a different regulatory environment.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.080]   We haven't really, nobody's complained about Facebook,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.400]   you know, buying WhatsApp or Instagram.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   I mean, do you and nobody's complaining now?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.280]   Because how much translated the conventions of the physical world to the digital world?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.480]   That's part of it, isn't it?
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   Yeah, because it's digital distribution now.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:14.240]   But presumably James Bond, Amazon could say James Bond movies will only be shown on Amazon Prime.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.400]   Bezos, Jeff Bezos.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.240]   Disney does that on Disney Plus.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.160]   There are certain films that only show there.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.320]   That's absolutely right.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.400]   Mandalorian's only available on Disney Plus.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.200]   All right.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.040]   I mean, but I would argue though.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.280]   Well, Bezos is announced by the way that he's retiring.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.800]   Well, as CEO, he'll be on the store.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.000]   That's one more than, will he be pulling any levers after all the distancing closes and
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.720]   is official?
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.920]   No one knows.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.480]   He'll get a cameo on at least three films, guaranteed.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.680]   Ah, that's how you do it.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.360]   He can get cameos and films today.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.640]   No, I mean, Elon was in movie.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.480]   I mean, every rich Larry Ellison who nobody likes was in movies.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.600]   Come on.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.920]   What movie was Larry Ellison in?
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.400]   Also, was that the one where Sinbad is a genie?
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.800]   No, Larry Ellison.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.680]   He was what movie was Larry Ellison in?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.200]   Hold on.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   Hold on.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.880]   So Bezos has an ad for the nerds.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.480]   Yeah, really.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.280]   Silicon Valley.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.320]   I don't think that was the one it.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   Anyway, is it Bezos or Amazon?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.440]   It's not completely clear.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.320]   Amazon is no longer Jeff's personal.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.840]   Ironman 2.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.360]   Was he an Ironman 2 along with what's his name?
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.680]   I remember there was like a cocktail party
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.280]   and he's wandering around or something in their face.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.040]   He's in IMDB.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.080]   Wow.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.560]   That's just pure pandering.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.960]   Anyway.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.560]   So.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.640]   In Tim Curry's performance at Charlie's Angels was supposed to be him.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   Tim Curry.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.360]   Tim Curry.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.880]   The evil villain in Charlie's Angels.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.840]   Do you remember that?
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.400]   Was supposed to be Larry Ellison.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:00.720]   Okay.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   So 8.45 billion.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:11.360]   I remember when Kirk Corian was unloading MGM because it was like so deep and dead and so
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:11.920]   worthless.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.200]   I guess it's worth something now.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.120]   Well, it got sold again and again and lost stuff along the way.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.720]   Right.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.360]   No, I can't even remember grandpa.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.000]   Gone with the wind.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.720]   Yes.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.880]   I remember now is a show.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.360]   I remember.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.840]   Well, what studio was originally?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   MGM, wasn't it?
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.080]   Right.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.760]   So, and I think Ted Turner.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.960]   Right.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   He'll got gone with the wind.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.240]   He took away some of those.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.120]   Now, of course, no one's going to show me on with the wind anymore.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:41.840]   Right.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.200]   Turner Class of the movies.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.520]   Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind are not part of the Amazon MGM deal because
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.840]   they were bought earlier.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.200]   So, Prime will get 4,000 movies, 17,000 hours of television.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.480]   No Wizard of Oz, no singing in the rain, no Gone with the Wind.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.880]   They all belonged to Warner Media, HBO Max.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.080]   Because Ted-
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.880]   Which would turn-
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.880]   Which Warner got through the Turner-
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.040]   All of this stuff just sounds status quo for today though.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.720]   Everything is exclusive now.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.040]   Every-
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.200]   Every-
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.120]   I think there is a description search-
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.960]   That's a disadvantage for consumers, right?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.920]   It really is.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.760]   Because you end up having to subscribe to everyone.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.440]   So, this was what everybody told us when they said,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   "Hey, we're going to end up with no cable.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.040]   What you're going to do is you're going to buy a million-
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.400]   You're going to have to buy a million different-
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.040]   Well, it's $10,000.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.800]   Well, but the original plan was disaggregation.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.360]   The theory that a lot of us had with court cutting would be,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.600]   you would be able to just get the things you wanted.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.160]   You wouldn't-
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.920]   Because cable members sold you-
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.880]   You get ESPN,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.640]   but you also get 15 other channels that you-
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.720]   Free-hot channels that you never watched.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.560]   So, the theory was,
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.000]   "Oh, we could disaggregate."
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.920]   And of course, immediately,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.960]   as always happens when this disaggregation happens,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.440]   re-aggregation.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.240]   Consolidation.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:02.800]   Consolidation.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.600]   Consolidation follows.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.240]   Always happens.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:04.960]   Because-
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.840]   You can say the same thing about all of these services.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.160]   You subscribe to Netflix,
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.240]   and they have all of these different categories
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.840]   that you never even flipped to.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.280]   But get your still paying at full subscription price,
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.960]   just like you would for a cable service.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.080]   It's a little easier to drop these.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.840]   I'm waiting for the pricing to change on them,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.040]   to really lock you in.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.760]   But like,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.480]   so, you know, I'll subscribe to HBO Max,
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.560]   like, three months out of the year.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.280]   So, I'll subscribe for a month and then dump it.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:33.600]   And then-
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.720]   Yeah, I've done that too.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.760]   Depends on the season, if you will.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.000]   So really, that's all Kirk-Corkorian is doing.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.080]   He's canceling and re-upping.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.560]   He's-
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.720]   He's bought and sold MGM three times.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.400]   There you go.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.640]   He's just doing it on a slightly larger scale.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.680]   A slightly larger scale.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.240]   Fargo.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.000]   They own Fargo.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.960]   They own the graduate.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   What does MGM made for us lately?
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.480]   What is Bezos buying in current production talent?
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.840]   Well, there is a new Bond movie,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   which was supposed to come out last year,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280]   which has been held because of COVID,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.520]   and we'll come out this Christmas.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.640]   I mean, MGM has not been one of those-
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.680]   No, no, no, no.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.800]   It lost a lot of-
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.040]   It's all-
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.800]   So, MGM movies-
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.840]   Let me look and see what MGM released in 2020.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.880]   It's gonna be-
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.240]   It's gonna be amazing.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.600]   Breaking news in Yuba County.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   Respect.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   They did a star as born.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.080]   That star-
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.880]   Which the new one?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.080]   Oh, wait, wait.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.640]   The one-
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.520]   Yeah, the new one.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.640]   All right.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.160]   Bill and Ted face the music.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.120]   Legally Blonde 3 is coming.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.240]   And Legally Blonde.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.200]   Creed 3.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.160]   All children of the 80s,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.520]   they have the secret anem.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.880]   Adams family 2.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.640]   All right, this is all-
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.400]   Samaritans coming out.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   So in 2020, they only did two movies-
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.160]   Valley Girl and the Wrath of Man.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.840]   So is that-
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.880]   Is that inventory really worth $8.45 billion?
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.480]   Well-
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   Having a wide inventory of content might be worth that.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.560]   So what-
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   That's a question.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.920]   So which makes-
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.600]   What makes a movie studio valuable?
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.240]   The catalog-
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.520]   The back catalog-
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.280]   Or the prospects for new movies.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.320]   You know,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.360]   it's my sense that-
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.240]   The movie companies make money
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.640]   because they have the right people running them, right?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.080]   They have a nose for what's going to make money
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.480]   and they know how to produce it and they can make it happen.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.960]   Well, the deadline says that the executive team is in play.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.280]   Yeah, so you don't get the executives,
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.240]   but what you do get-
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.360]   Turns out the Winklevoss brothers are making a movie
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.080]   called the anti-social network for MGM.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.640]   I'm not-
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.080]   You're serious?
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.040]   I'm not kidding.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.280]   You're serious.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   They've got the new-
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   This is all from Wikipedia.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.400]   The new Fiddler on the Roof.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.960]   They're going to make Porgy and Bess-
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.760]   Oh!
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.360]   They own Project Hail Mary.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:09.920]   Oh boy.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.400]   That's-
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.920]   That's what I was going to ask you to do.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.320]   That's interesting.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.080]   Do they have Project Hail Mary?
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.480]   They do.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.080]   Considering you just had them on the show-
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.480]   They do.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.120]   Yeah, we-
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.000]   Martin-
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.280]   Smooth ant.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:19.760]   Smooth.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.320]   The author of the Marcia and Andy Weir who's wonderful.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.640]   It's going to be a great movie.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.120]   Of the Untitled Richard Pryor-
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.880]   Oh, this is good.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.800]   Untitled Richard Pryor biopic-
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.280]   Untitled Sammy Davis Junior Biopic-
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   And the Reboot of the Pink Panther series.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.320]   Which has been released at least twice.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.040]   Bottom.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.240]   Bottom.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:40.800]   Bottom.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.360]   Bottom.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:41.600]   Bottom.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.080]   Bottom.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.560]   Bottom.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:42.880]   Bottom.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   Bottom.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.520]   Bottom.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.600]   More I love me some dinner sacks.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   Now I know why they paid nine billion dollars.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.200]   Tomb Raider 2.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.840]   I'm joking.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.640]   I'm joking.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.680]   But here we are,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.920]   here we are, a show about platforms.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.160]   Talking about the old platform,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.040]   the movie studio.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.800]   So again, that is a legit question.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.880]   Toto's said we don't know how to do this.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.400]   Get us out of here.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.800]   Jane stopped this crazy thing.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.240]   But Amazon is buying this.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.200]   I think having a nice back catalog is pretty important too.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.400]   Yeah, considering what happened with Netflix last year and 2019 as well.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.000]   Uh, getting a lot of run out of that show,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   friends and a bunch of other old shows.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.640]   What was the other one?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.360]   The office.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.840]   The office.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   You know what that, yeah.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   Got a lot of live studios.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.560]   They made me pay money for seasons of parks and rec on Peacock.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.680]   That is my therapy.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.360]   I was very sick.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.320]   How dare they.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.000]   Oh, you love Ron Swanson too.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.880]   You're so awesome.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.760]   I Leslie Nope is my spirit animal.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.960]   I love Leslie Nope.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.320]   What a great name by the way.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.880]   That's a great name for it.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.320]   What was she a city?
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.520]   She was the Parks and Rec.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.560]   She was part.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.480]   She was the Deputy Director of Parks and Rec.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:06.880]   Deputy Director.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.920]   And Bonnie Indiana.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.880]   Bonnie Indiana.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.760]   That's right.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.080]   So they own a lot of TV shows.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.520]   I don't see anything quite as maybe as big as friends.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   The wild, weird, the wild, weird world of Dr. Goldfoot from 1965.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.200]   Mars needs women.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.440]   Yeah, I remember well American International Television.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.400]   Yeah, it's not looking that strong.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.800]   Not looking that strong.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.360]   So who is Apple going to buy a studio?
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.400]   Who else would buy a studio?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.880]   Apple, Apple I think is exactly the kind of company that will not buy a studio,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.720]   but instead will buy properties and executives.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   They don't need, but they need catalog.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.080]   And right in a way, really, that's what's heard Apple TV plus.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.000]   That's what they have been able to charge for it.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.440]   They keep pushing the date that they'll start charging for it,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.960]   but often to the future.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.920]   Because I think they're afraid, quite legitimately,
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.000]   that nobody will buy it without catalog.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.880]   I thought Apple was taking me many templates.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.240]   I'll buy it on a monthly basis for Ted Lasso.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.960]   Well, that's right.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.200]   And so maybe the way you build catalog is you just make as many shows as you can.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.320]   Maybe after a few years.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.000]   That's what I thought they were doing.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.720]   Like what Netflix was doing with this original content
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.120]   and going pretty much all in on it.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   What's spending $50 million here, $50 million there
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:33.360]   to bring this writer and this director and produce a whole lot of original content that people love.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.200]   I thought that's what Apple was going to do.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.600]   Crossing Jordan, they own Crossing Jordan.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.360]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.960]   Will and Grace also, they own that.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.200]   Will and Grace is funny.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.240]   Well, the Tony D'Anza show.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.640]   Jeez.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.080]   Saved by the bell, the college years.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.920]   Yeah, but I mean, so Netflix is an interesting story because Netflix pivoted, right?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.240]   They were originally DVDs by mail.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.360]   And when they first launched the streaming thing,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.880]   we were just talking about this this morning with Paul Thorett in this context.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.040]   They didn't have really anything you would want to see,
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.080]   but they quickly beefed up both their back catalog like the office.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.280]   I mean, that's where you watched it until they, Peacock took it away.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.040]   But they also did a very aggressive and very expensive.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.720]   They spent more than $9 billion making new content last year.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.640]   Huge, huge budget.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.400]   And so really $9 billion for catalog is not a huge amount of money in that context.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.080]   All right, true.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.560]   True that.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.400]   Anyway, it's fascinating.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.320]   And I do wonder already, there are lawmakers are weighing in.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.160]   As they say, here's representative Ken Buck.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:58.320]   As in the Buck stops here, no, he is a representative from Colorado's fourth district.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.680]   Member of the judiciary proudly representing Colorado's fourth district.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.920]   This proposed merger is yet another example.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.320]   I should probably do it as fog horn, leg horn.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.840]   Listen, proposed merger.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.200]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.720]   This is another example.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.000]   We're going to save you for yourself.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.480]   A big one.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.600]   I think that's a great voice.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.880]   But anyway, a big text commitment to total dominance in every sector of our economy.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.080]   If Congress doesn't act soon, there won't be a market.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.000]   Big tech doesn't control.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.640]   I thought Republicans liked capitalism in big companies.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.600]   I'm so confused.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.160]   Just it is.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.200]   It is a little confusing.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:42.160]   I'm going to leave for like probably two to three minutes really fast.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.880]   Okay, take your time.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.360]   No problem.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.440]   If you just left, no one would have known Stacy because I deal with it all the time.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.200]   I do actually.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.480]   I frequently get up.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.040]   I tell John, whatever you do, don't cut to me because you'll cut to an empty chair.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.160]   And you know that the world just keeps talking and so it's fine.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.040]   Well, I usually wait till you have something to say and then I can.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.080]   Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.280]   And then you leave.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.920]   When the moral panic sign comes on.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.320]   Good.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.600]   It's a slow-mo degree.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:07.920]   I go out and have a smoke.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.320]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.720]   So you know, you wonder what would Facebook have been smart
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:23.280]   to actually make its own content and people might like it for a sitcom instead of hate it for other things.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.040]   Well, we've talked about this classic collision between Hollywood and Silicon Valley and their models.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.880]   Quibi being the classic Hollywood play where you say, we're going to pay lots of money,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.200]   get the best talent, the best stars, make really high quality content.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.440]   And we know nine out of 10 will be flops, but that one in 10 that makes money will make so much
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   money will be friends that it'll pay for everything else. That's the Hollywood model.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.520]   And it failed for Quibi, obviously.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.160]   And then there's the digital Silicon Valley model, the YouTube model, which is we get everybody to
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.320]   make content for us. We use the algorithm TikTok does this, YouTube does this.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.360]   We get like the algorithm pick the best stuff and profit.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.080]   And honestly, I think that's a better model.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.720]   Okay, where does Netflix follow that?
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   Netflix is in the Hollywood model. Absolutely.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.920]   Hollywood model.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.240]   All right.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.840]   Except, except, except, and really good question because it's not in the sense that
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.000]   it requires the blockbuster of how many tickets were bought, how many books were bought.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.560]   It is a loyalty model. It is like a magazine model the old days.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.440]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.240]   You can't remember model.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   Well, this is my being a subscription model on Netflix.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.600]   And that's what Amazon wants to do.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:40.560]   In fact, there was a rumor that, and I believe it true, Netflix is trying to hire somebody to run
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.720]   a games division that one of the things they'll start streaming is games.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.840]   Not watching other people play, but you play kind of like Stadia.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.960]   You play online.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.720]   And that kind of makes, to me, it makes a lot of sense, actually.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:03.440]   Getting back to Amazon is prime video and afterthought for you, you folks here.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:03.920]   No.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.520]   When you go to watch television, is that like top of mind?
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:07.840]   Huh.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.880]   I want to check out what's on Amazon Prime today.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.800]   No, it's one of the big three that we check.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.600]   What's your third Netflix Amazon end?
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.480]   Actually, I should say four because we do check Showtime and HBO.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.800]   But really, Netflix Amazon Prime.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.160]   Hulu?
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.120]   No.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.360]   Hulu, Hulu, you know, it's funny.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.720]   So that's an interesting thing.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.320]   It's not the content in Hulu is bad.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.160]   I often want to watch content in Hulu.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   The interface there is.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.720]   There you are.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.080]   It's so awful.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.800]   I don't want to use it.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.160]   And then they put ads in.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.240]   And even though I'm paying as far as I could tell, the most you could pay for Hulu.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.360]   And I still get ads.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.720]   I thought it was supposed to be free.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.360]   So Hulu is, is they're shooting themselves in the foot because they have good.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.120]   I'd love to watch some of the stuff on Hulu.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.360]   How about any of the new ones, you know, Paramount's and NBC's and CBS's.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.880]   Maybe I'm hitting that subscription fatigue thing, but I think it must be.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.000]   I don't do Peacock.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.800]   I don't do Paramount.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.680]   I have Disney Plus by accident.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.200]   I think I got it from Verizon.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.280]   That's the thing.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.200]   You got it free for a year from Verizon.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:18.080]   I do Apple because and that's by accident too, because I buy the Apple Plus subscription,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.960]   which includes Apple TV Plus, but a bunch of other stuff.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.560]   So yeah, I mean, I spent Amazon has some pretty good stuff on their,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.680]   on their platform, but it's never top of mind for me.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.640]   I never see any type of marketing for it.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:39.440]   Even on my device, this listening to me all day, it's is no where they
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.960]   Netflix YouTube or Hulu.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.720]   You know, where they market really well is on the Amazon devices and the fire TVs.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.480]   Pretty much a viral.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.120]   TV is an ad for Amazon Prime.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.280]   The things that I don't have, I know.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.920]   You know, and what strikes me is, is that so many of the, I like series more than movies.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.520]   And so many of them on the platforms are so depressing.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.040]   Yeah, I've gone through that too, especially last year.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.000]   I had a pretty much spent most of last year just watching reruns because I didn't want to be
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.560]   bummed out.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.000]   I refused to put a bunch of dark crap around me and just cloud up my space.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.360]   I'd refuse to do this.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.480]   The Nazi's with America.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:25.920]   The right wing religious nuts take over America.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.480]   From technology takes over the UK.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.960]   They're just so dark.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.320]   You know what?
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.120]   It really is the best streaming value money can buy.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.880]   What's that?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.280]   Take it.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.840]   What's that?
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.720]   Glove to it.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:41.680]   Podcasts.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.800]   For a minute, look at what you get.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.200]   For a mere $7 a month, ad-free shows of all kinds.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.640]   I mean, there's shows like this show of all kinds.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.360]   That's just by itself, I think worth $7 a month.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.360]   But then you also get our Club Twit, Twit Plus bonus content.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.000]   Stuff that we don't put in the shows, but there's a lot of good stuff in there, including
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.760]   we're now doing a Linux show and other stuff.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.680]   And then of course, our Discord, which we've come to really enjoy.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.960]   It's turned out to be the surprise hit of the Club Twit.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.160]   If you want to know more, $7 a month, go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.480]   And by the way, that ad, Club Twit members don't see that either.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:33.360]   But Club Twit members do get to see me talk about my awesome fan mail that,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.320]   you know, you will probably make a bit out of that.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.800]   Sure.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.240]   That should go in the Twit Plus feed.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.120]   Stuff from the cutting room floor.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.880]   The other week, I asked you permission when Audible came back to talk about Audible,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.960]   and I talked about Audible and Stacey talked about Audible,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.160]   you talked about Audible, and somebody accused me of Twitter saying you did all of that,
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.680]   just to get people to join Club Twit.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.840]   We do in fact.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.200]   It was a long commercial.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.120]   Stacey's leaving again.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.240]   Oh, she leaves again.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.720]   She has very low tolerance.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.840]   I'm taking this personally.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.520]   I'm sorry, but I think so.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.280]   I am taking this personally.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.640]   Maybe we should talk about Stacey's article while she's gone from Stacey on IOT,
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.000]   a deep dive into Google I/O's smart home news.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.120]   Oh, I was hoping that would draw her back, but there she is.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.680]   Okay, I'm back.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.280]   I'm so sorry.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.360]   It's chaos right now.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.320]   What's going on?
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.200]   I think I heard thunder or something.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.400]   No, that's my chair rolling across the floor.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.360]   No, that was my dog.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.720]   That was a dog related interruption.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.440]   The prior one was a doctor interruption.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.520]   Did you pick up a waffle on the way, Stacey?
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.080]   A cookie?
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.840]   No, there was no waffle involved.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.560]   Oh, damn.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:44.960]   This time.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.120]   This time.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.000]   Exactly.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.040]   Right attitude, Anne.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.600]   You know me.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.240]   So I had breakfast with Henry today, and we were talking about his TikTok,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480]   which features some of the most delicious looking.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.880]   I said, can you come over and shoot some of those at our house so we can eat the food afterwards?
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.040]   So I think we're going to, I think we're actually what I told him, Stacey, is if you did some
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:14.000]   thermomics recipes, there's a whole community of thermomics users that you could add to your TikTok.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.360]   And then wait, you know what?
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.320]   I'm getting an idea.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.840]   I'm going to create a thermomics channel and I'll expense the thermomics.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.520]   Exactly.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.480]   And Henry, if he doesn't do it, I'm coming for him.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.240]   Well, then, that's nice thing about TikTok.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.600]   You could do a collab as the kids say.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.320]   I also said I have a Vitamix if you want to try that in a June oven.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   We could.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.760]   I have a Vitamix and a June oven.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.160]   I'm good.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:40.480]   I know.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.360]   Well, I'm just saying.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.880]   I told him, I said, I literally said to him, hang come over and I'll give you a tour of the kitchen.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.480]   You can decide what you want to shoot.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.280]   I'll show you what I got.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.720]   Plus, I think your pizza oven.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   Oh, I forgot the uni.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.160]   Yes.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.360]   I have shocked in an awe.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.720]   You still have the pizza oven?
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.120]   Of course.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.960]   What would I throw it away?
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.440]   Well, okay, that's true.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.240]   I have only used it a couple of times.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.480]   I have, well, and I said, come over.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.240]   We'll make chicken and waffles.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:20.960]   And I have the finest cast iron skillet made today from butter pad industries.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.760]   Do you know about that?
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.280]   I don't know that.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.160]   Butter pad industries.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.320]   I just have a, I have a, what's it called?
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.320]   La Cruzette.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   No, La Cruzette is fine.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.600]   And I have many La Cruzettes.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   But the butter pad industry cast iron pan is the finest cast iron pan made today.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.880]   It's polished cast iron cookware.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.960]   And they are not an advertiser.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.360]   Although if I could get them, I would be very happy.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.800]   What was the shipping cost on those?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.200]   Oh, I don't.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.320]   These are ridiculous.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.640]   Like truthfully, I just, you know, get a lodge pan at the, at the five and, at the good will,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:00.880]   right?
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.600]   Some, a lot of cast iron, rusty cast iron pan.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.400]   You can get like a lodge one everywhere.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.680]   And then just, and then you condition them.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:15.200]   But I have to say the butter pads even better because they take a little extra care to polish it.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.960]   So it's really smooth.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.800]   Interesting.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.880]   Did you help with Sarah?
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   No, I did not.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.400]   I'm not that stupid.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.360]   Well, maybe I am.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:25.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.640]   They see, didn't you get one?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.760]   No, no one here got it.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.160]   Oh, no, no.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.000]   I thought y'all made fun of me for the June oven.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.560]   But you know what?
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.680]   I stand by that purchase.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.200]   I love that thing.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.880]   I just wish that I had known they were going to cut the cost by about 35.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.600]   Well, I just bought a new one.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.120]   That's how, because we just, we just, we had.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.960]   Well, we, we use, we use it so, we use it like, especially because of the pandemic,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.720]   we were using this thing like five times a day every single day.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.640]   And we, we kind of wore out the, what's it called?
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.960]   We broke the handle and then it became more and more difficult to clean.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.080]   And then when the handle broke, we were just like, screw it.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.640]   We're getting into it.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.280]   Yep.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.080]   Time for a new one.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.000]   Now, what's the go to thing in your June oven?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.200]   What's the, what's the, oh, I'll tell you, Brussels sprouts for us.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.320]   Roast Brussels sprouts.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.440]   It does that automatically.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.160]   It's awesome.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.200]   They're so good.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.120]   Ours is probably chicken and waffles.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.200]   I mean, we do toast a lot of waffles.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.680]   But the things it cooks for cooking is chicken, salmon, and asparagus,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.800]   and then any vegetable.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.640]   So we roast all our vegetables in that thing.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.440]   Like every night there's a vegetable going into the gym.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   Let me, just for the ASMR fans, here is a, a, a, a, a, um, spatula scraping across a
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.800]   traditional, a traditional pan.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.680]   Turn up my sound.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.760]   Okay.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.080]   Listen.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.520]   That was quick.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.960]   Okay.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.920]   Traditional pan.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.960]   See that?
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.640]   Traditional.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.120]   And now.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.160]   A polish.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.400]   Listen to the butter pet.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.120]   You hear the difference?
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.680]   Okay.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.320]   That's why.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.120]   What is the proof?
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.000]   What does that tell you?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:16.960]   I don't know.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.440]   Your biscuits taste better, because they're not, I don't know.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.840]   That's the most ridiculous pollack demonstration I've ever seen.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.760]   Easier to clean.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.960]   Let me, let me put this, this skillet over Leo's head.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.640]   Let's put this skillet over Leo's head.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.200]   This one makes a louder noise.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.080]   Must make better.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:34.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.440]   I don't, I'm asking the important questions.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.800]   The important questions he asks.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.000]   What the heck?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.720]   And I am going to give my son and stick talk one more plug,
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.040]   salt underscore hank, if you want to watch.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.600]   Hank's killing it.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.640]   The best cooking.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.000]   He really is, isn't he?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.800]   You know what he's killing it.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.440]   You know what I thought he was doing this all with an iPhone?
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.640]   He said, well, no, actually the iPhone I use for the top down
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.840]   shot and then I use the Canon 5D Mark 4 for the video.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.560]   I said, well, they match.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   He said, oh yeah, they match quite well.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.760]   So that's.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.960]   Big cheese more of her.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.880]   And you know what, an interesting thing, Ant.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.000]   He uses, I thought I gave him all these fancy microphones.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.640]   He uses the built in microphone on the 5D Mark 4.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.160]   He says it's actually the best sound because sound is important for him.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.200]   The, the chopping.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.800]   Was he always a cook?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.440]   Um, yeah.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.000]   I mean, I, you know, I cooked, I made sure that when I cooked,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.760]   I taught him how to do it and stuff, but.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.440]   Good dad.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.000]   Good dad.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.200]   He, uh.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.320]   And now I, oh, well, this is the thing.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.600]   I said, come over.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   I said, what happens to this food?
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.040]   He said, I, he said I had a couple of bites.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.840]   It was too much.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.480]   I said, what happens then?
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.800]   He says, well, I bring it out every Friday.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.640]   I bring a bunch of stuff over to my friends.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.960]   That's awesome.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.280]   I like the hanging out posture of it.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   I know.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.480]   It's very cute.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:54.960]   He's on the counter.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.480]   He, you know, young people understand the medium better.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.440]   I said, keep it up.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.800]   Don't, he said, I want to do a podcast.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   I said, no, no, that's, that's old school.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.480]   You're, you're a people.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.440]   It's old people.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.360]   I seriously, the media.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:07.760]   No, yeah.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.320]   Those people born in 1920 and 1940.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.360]   I mean, that's all they're doing.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.720]   Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.040]   The landscape is changing so rapidly.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.680]   This was the hot thing 15 years ago.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.360]   It's, it's, and it's hot in some respects, but no TikTok.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.480]   The media companies now.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.480]   It was the big media companies that started wearing the NARU jacket.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.280]   It wasn't cool anymore.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:27.920]   It's not cool.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.120]   Once the big, big guys arrive, then you know it's no longer cool.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.240]   And honestly, I really think TikTok and I have to say Discord too,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.920]   are really impressing me.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.040]   I think that both of which are used mostly by people under 25.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.840]   That's.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   TikTok is the first, to me, it is so important.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.600]   I've said it before, it is the first truly collaborative platform.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.680]   And that's, that's.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.840]   They've done a lot of things right.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.640]   It's the future.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.960]   Are we at all worried anymore about them being owned by China?
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.920]   Does that, did that just stop being a concern?
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.200]   That stopped being a concern.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.040]   Okay.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.800]   It just sort of went away.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.600]   Just disappeared.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.000]   Just disappeared.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.280]   Is Larry Ellison a movie star?
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.000]   Is he disappointed that he didn't get his TikTok?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.280]   Yeah, that he didn't get their cloud business because.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.960]   He was, he and Walmart were going to buy it together.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.480]   There's a match made in heaven.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.760]   All right.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.040]   Back to our deep dive into Google I/O's smart home news.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.360]   I have to confess I'm was little disappointed with the Google I/O keynote.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.880]   We've talked about that last week.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.360]   But this is your particular, you know, beat.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.280]   So I'd love to hear what you think was the big story in home.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.400]   In fact, you had exclusives.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.000]   You couldn't reveal a last.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.560]   That's right.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.360]   I did.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.120]   So I knew, I knew the.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.880]   I'll tell you what, let's take a break.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   It's Stacy will reveal all when we come back.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.840]   How about that for a time?
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.760]   Well, she walks away from us again, which she might do.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.440]   I was just saying, unless I move.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.920]   You could walk away, but just come back, please.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.440]   So leave us.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.480]   Come back.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:09.440]   Our show today, actually, I have to go and get the, get the clipboard.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.280]   Our show today, it's actually no longer a clipboard.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.600]   It's a virtual clipboard brought to you by Udacity.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.760]   Actually, this is a really nice combination with this week in Google,
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.360]   because Udacity was founded by a Googler, Sebastian Thrun.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.080]   Beginning of the decade, I joined in 2012.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.320]   I think he started at 2010 or 2011.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.680]   But I remember the reason I joined it, we talked about the Nanodegree program back in 2012.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.320]   What happened was Google and others realized big companies that they weren't getting the employees.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.480]   They needed the skills they needed.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.600]   Even people who had gone and got computer science degrees
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.920]   weren't really ready for the workforce.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:54.160]   Sebastian worked with Google and other big companies to create these Nanodegrees.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.600]   Udacity offers a unique part-time, so you can do it with your current job
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.360]   with an eye towards the next job, online education program
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   that's geared for those people who are looking to take their technology to the next level
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   with really great specialized and exciting content.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.480]   These Nanodegrees, they did in conjunction with Google, but also Microsoft, IBM, Amazon,
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.920]   many other companies.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.320]   Those companies said, "Look, these are the skills.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.120]   These are the things we need our employees to know."
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.200]   Udacity offers the latest cutting-edge Nanodegree program,
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.720]   some of which are not available, most of which are not available anywhere else.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:38.480]   I mean, imagine they have a program on flying car and autonomous flight engineering.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.360]   Where else are you going to learn that?
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.840]   AI, deep learning, intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer, robotics,
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.520]   software engineer.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.120]   So when you get these skills, this makes you so desirable in this market
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.720]   because companies are dying to get people in the door who can help them
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   innovate in this area.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.080]   Blockchain developer, look at that in the School of Programming and Development.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.280]   If you love learning, you're always learning to learn more tech stuff.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.120]   You will love Udacity.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.000]   They can help you master the latest tech skills and techniques.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.080]   What I love and really enjoy about Udacity, of course, they've got the video courses,
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:22.720]   but as part of this is very much hands-on, there's always projects to do active learning
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.120]   that covers cutting-edge technology.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.080]   Another advantage they have over the brick and mortar schools is they can really be up to date.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.560]   These are constantly updating their catalog.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.600]   These are constantly changing because technology doesn't sit still.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.080]   But when you're doing those projects, you're proving that you know how to do it, and that's
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   so important.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.640]   Your homework, your projects all review by qualified professionals.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.280]   You'll get human feedback, code reviews.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:54.400]   You'll have access to mentors 24/7, and you can absolutely do this in your spare time.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.560]   Udacity is completely flexible.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.200]   You set your course schedule, your own pace.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.920]   But if you're really motivated, you could put in as little as five to 10 hours a week,
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.120]   anytime of the day or night, and graduate in as little as three months, you could have a better
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.160]   job in three months.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:19.520]   According to the World Economic Forum, 75 million jobs will be replaced by automated processes
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.040]   in the next three years.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.760]   If you're looking behind you right now thinking, "I don't know what my job is going to be like
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:31.120]   in the future," Udacity will prepare you for the jobs that are coming, the future jobs.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.880]   No wonder 14 million people now have taken Udacity courses.

[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.840]   IT support data analytics project management.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.080]   Because on Sun, Jake is taking one of them right now.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:38.800]   Oh, you're kidding.

[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.000]   So Jake got a four-year degree, though, right?
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.720]   Jake needs to beef up on some specific--
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.880]   Oh, he's got a few things.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.600]   Yes, he is.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.880]   He was a programmer.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   He was writing Facebook code in high school.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.840]   Yeah, he was.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.280]   Very motivated.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.200]   So what does he want to do now?
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.280]   He loves security.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.000]   That's the thing.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.720]   It's a pivot for him.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.560]   He loves really interesting with security.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.280]   Good.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.560]   Well, I know he's got the skills.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.760]   He's a very talented coterie at a very young age.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   Wow.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.160]   So that's great.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:16.960]   That's really great.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.360]   So your dishwasher can now talk to your Nest Hub.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.280]   Whoo!
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.600]   Those are just--
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.400]   So they did announce new notifications.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.280]   So your appliances, you can now hear, like,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.160]   if your dishwasher is done, it'll do your nice.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.040]   I would love that, actually.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.080]   Like, exactly.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.360]   I actually thought that was really cool.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:45.120]   But so the big news was, hey, the hubs,
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.160]   the current generation, Nest thermostat,
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.320]   the-- a lot of the speakers and the Wi-Fi routers
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.040]   are all getting matter support going forward.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.520]   Matter.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:57.760]   What's matter?
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.320]   So we talked about that.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   What's matter?
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.360]   Oh, matter is what project chips.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.600]   So project connected home over IP became.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.080]   Ah, that's right.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.520]   And that is an interoperability standard for the internet of things.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.320]   It's for certain smart home devices.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.680]   So they will all work together,
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.040]   even if you're using Google or HomeKit.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.400]   Or Amazon's Echo.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.760]   You could just swap in between
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.680]   because they all now share a common data.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.120]   That's really good news.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.760]   Has Apple said they're going to do that too with HomeKit?
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.080]   Yes.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.920]   Apple is one of the founding creators of Matter.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.040]   And they haven't said what devices will support Matter.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.880]   But most HomeKit devices coming out now have either Wi-Fi or thread.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.680]   And those are the two protocols that matter for Matter.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.360]   Boy, I poo-pooed chip.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.160]   I thought you're never going to get these companies to agree.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.920]   They all want silos.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.120]   And I was wrong.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.200]   This is great news.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:47.760]   Well, sort of.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.720]   But we've been talking about this for a couple of years though.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.800]   This hasn't been an overnight thing for sure.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.360]   It's been two years.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.480]   So they launched it.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.880]   They announced it in December of 2019.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.400]   The hope was that it would be out at the end of 2020.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.840]   But we had that pandemic.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.640]   So get it out.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.160]   Hey, everybody gets a dance.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.200]   I'm just saying, getting that many engineers together.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.640]   It's only five months later.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.520]   That's not awful.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.400]   Well, it's now in .7 release.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.120]   So it's not going to--
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.160]   I was sort of at least enough.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.200]   Main features are all set.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.960]   So this fall, sometime in September,
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.840]   so is when they'll be able to start testing devices.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.240]   And they're going to be devices for sale.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.480]   NED Atmo, Logitech-wise, all participating.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.440]   Oh, it's 180 companies.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:37.920]   It's crazy.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.400]   Wow.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.440]   It's really--
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.040]   I never thought this would happen.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.960]   The only thing I can think of is
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:48.320]   they finally realized after 10 years of each going their own way with Zigbee and Z-Wave.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.520]   They finally realized that's a show stopper.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.800]   People are not going to buy into this unless everything can interrupt.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.920]   They're not going to put their foot in the water.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.120]   Right.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.160]   So they have to interrupt.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.040]   And all the developers are like,
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:06.080]   God, you know, the stupid man hours that we have to waste,
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.480]   like building an app for the HomeKit app,
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.920]   and then building for Google's ecosystem,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.600]   and building the bottom A integration, or the Amazon Echo integration.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.320]   It's just too much.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.880]   OK.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.200]   So Google I/O, they announced that their devices were going to work with Matter.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:21.680]   Goodness.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.480]   We knew this was coming.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.040]   We're glad.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.960]   They also said--
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.400]   what did they say that I was really excited about?
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:34.560]   They have, you know, like, they have an easy to connect Bluetooth option that was kind of meh.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:40.320]   And they also updated their policies around security.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.400]   So they've got some new security policies.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.200]   They announced this.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.040]   I don't know if you had to actually follow it,
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.360]   but they now have you following it,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.720]   that every year you have to get recertified with Google's policies and security efforts,
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.320]   or if you announce a new feature.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:02.000]   And one of those things that they're now adding is if it's like a plug or something
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.800]   that caused damage in the Home, it has to have a physical security element tied to it.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.360]   So some sort of certification like UL or-- I don't know what it is in China.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:18.960]   So basically, that's a nice-- they're saying, hey, if our device is going to control one of your
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:23.680]   devices, your device needs to have all the physical safety things in addition to all of
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.760]   these cybersecurity standards that we've set.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.320]   So that's good.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:32.480]   And then they created like a website where you can find smart home products at work with Google.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:38.400]   And then-- So we asked you this last week, we should look for matter on the box from now on.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.760]   Yeah, so right now we're in this awkward, stupid phase where nothing's matter certified and
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.680]   won't be until later at the end of this year.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.920]   I tell people who say, like, what do I do? Do I dump my stuff?
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.880]   Don't dump your stuff. Keep your stuff. As matter stuff comes out, buy it.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:59.600]   Some of your gear is going to get updated to work with it, and some of it you're going to have to
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.800]   replace. And check-- Don't freak out now. Make sure it's a company that's in the matter alliance,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.200]   right? Yeah, well, they'll have a matter-- Who's missing a little one?
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.120]   --a little matter logo. Well, you pointed out in your article that right now connected cameras
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.600]   aren't supported by the protocol. Is it too much bandwidth? No, it's-- cameras are a little harder.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.880]   So with matter, they're building data models, right? Standard data models. So I'm a light bulb,
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.640]   I turn off, I turn on. Here's how you do that. Here's how you change my colors. Here's, you know,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.000]   those elements. A camera's a little harder. And plus, I also think this is going to be like--
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.200]   this is where a lot of revenues made in subscriptions, so it's a little dicey.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.960]   It's a little more competitive for the company is working on this. But with cameras, you've got,
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.520]   you know, image recognition. How do you build a data model for all the types of things
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:58.000]   with image recognition? So there's a lot more to a camera that you have to account for than some
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.800]   of these other devices. But there is a plan even with cameras. I mentioned all the camera
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.360]   companies. Yeah. Going to support it. Yeah, yeah. There is a plan. I just don't know if we'll get there.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.880]   Right now you're looking at lighting, blinds. You have a nice-- from the Zigbee Alliance, a nice
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.480]   graphic that shows what device types. Lighting, electrical, blinds. Oh, the slide is old.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:27.360]   HVAC controls. They remain themselves connected. The Connectivity Standards Alliance.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.800]   CSA. I'm so confused. Yeah. This hubscats of America. Access Control, Safety and Security
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:42.080]   Access Point Bridges Connected Home ORIP controllers. So, but this is intended.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.280]   This is part of your article. Should you get-- sell all of your smart home gear to get ready for
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:54.160]   matter? And I presume the answer is no. Kevin Tofen wrote this actually. Yeah. Yeah. He writes
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.320]   all of our-- we answer a question on our show each week and he writes all the articles answering
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.280]   the questions. You wouldn't recommend that. No, just chill out for a little bit.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:10.240]   See what happens and then gradually replace because it's pretty expensive to replace all
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.520]   of your smart home gear. That adds up. Google also has a figure all of this out. This is so--
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:23.200]   Chip begot matter or is it the other way around? You missed two weeks and you missed a lot.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.240]   Let me tell you. You missed at least five pivots. Three names. Back two weeks ago.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.360]   Yeah, two weeks ago almost exactly. I'm looking at my calendar. They did a rebranding
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.040]   where chip became matter and then the Zigbee Alliance became the Connectivity Standards
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:47.840]   Alliance because it no longer made sense to have the Zigbee Alliance have the matter protocol
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.760]   because Zigbee is going to be like, yeah, who cares about Zigbee and matter is going to be like
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.000]   super sexy and awesome. I'm trying to think of movie stars but anyway. So, the point is they
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.680]   became the Connectivity Standards Alliance. They also broaden their scope. So, they still have
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.280]   Zigbee under their purview. They're actually developing a couple other standards. I did a
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.360]   scoop last week where I talked about one of them as a connected lock standard and then they have
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.000]   matter. So, all of that's under the Connectivity Standards Alliance formerly known as the Zigbee
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.480]   Alliance. Okay. Thank you for that. Does that help? It does. Google also announced that they're
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.560]   going to put fuchsia, their operating system, on all of the-- All these existing devices,
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.560]   which I thought was really-- No, they said that-- No, no, no, hold on. They're putting fuchsia on
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:42.800]   the old displays. All the displays, the hub max, yeah. I'm really upset about this because
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.320]   why didn't they talk about this at I/O? They spent-- They did I/O and then a week later,
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.920]   they're like, by the way, that's huge. Yeah. And I've been curious about fuchsia. I'm like,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.200]   "You're in the war." They're what, and ready? Y'all next-- Oh, oh, I just get by my foot. It hurts.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:05.440]   Kevin did a deep dive into the GitHub repo on fuchsia and-- No, in Friday's newsletter,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.720]   he's got a fabulous article. I liked it so much I saved it for the newsletter. Oh, I can't wait.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.520]   Okay. It's really good. I'm a subscriber, of course, and you all should be at stacianiot.com.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:23.200]   So, this is their third major operating system, Android, Chrome OS, and now fuchsia. They've started
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.320]   this from scratch. We've been watching it develop and wondering, by the way, what the hell are they
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:34.480]   doing? It's interesting that they are going to take in-- They're going to in place replace
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.720]   what was cast OS, I think, on all these hub devices with fuchsia. Yeah, I checked mine. It
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.400]   doesn't have it yet, but-- It's going to roll out slowly over the next few months.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.920]   Oh, and I don't-- You've heard a little Lenovo displays, but I don't think it will.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.680]   There's a question. Captain Jack's asking. And someone else had asked me this, and
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.720]   the Lenovo ones run cast OS, but I don't think they're going to get the update,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.040]   because I think this is Google's way of testing it in a limited control environment.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.360]   They say you shouldn't notice any difference at all.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.480]   That you won't even know you've been upgraded unless you check. Have you seen anything that says,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.640]   "What makes fuchsia fuchsia? What's the architecture?" So, here's the awesome thing.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.800]   It's Friday's newsletter. Since we don't have that, you know.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.120]   Last week, we had to wait for your I/O views. This week, we have to wait for Kevin's
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.520]   Friday newsletter. Geez. I will go. I'm the anti-internet. You make us wait forever.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.480]   You know, there's a way to get around those commercials. It's a thing called
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:40.800]   Clutch, which is seven miles away. No, actually, hosts don't get to skip the commercials. Sorry.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:48.800]   So, Ronamadio on ours, Technica, writes about fuchsia. This is, I think, interesting. Fuchsia
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.840]   is something very rare in the world of tech. It's a built from scratch operating system that
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.640]   isn't based on Linux. It uses a microkernel called Zircon. Google's been working on this
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:07.920]   in-house since 2017, which is actually pretty fast for years for a brand new operating system.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.720]   They've been working on it since 2016. Oh, six years they've been working on it. Okay.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.640]   Fuchsia's primary app developer language is Flutter. And that's, by the way, why Google says
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:24.560]   you won't notice any difference. We're going to slip in Fuchsia underneath instead of CastOS,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:32.240]   both CastOS and Fuchsia used Flutter for the display, so we can make it exactly the same.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.520]   It's not going to change how it's a cross-platform UI toolkit, so it's not going to change how it looks.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.640]   Flutter right now runs on iOS and Android and the web. In fact, a lot of people are very interested
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:54.000]   in Flutter development, including Paul Therat. So interesting. You probably won't notice.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.560]   I don't know if Fuchsia is in any way better. I'm not sure what the point of this is, honestly.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.360]   CastOS, it wasn't a good choice. Oh, I'll give you some secret tips.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:10.320]   Here's what it's highly compartmentalized. And Kevin suspects that there will be secure.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.160]   Yeah, sandboxed. And everything is kind of very component-driven, which he thinks has
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.080]   good security implications. That's the modern way of handling security problems.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.560]   Yeah. So that's all I'm going to tell you though. The rest, you have to just wait.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:35.280]   Oh, shut up. It's just so mean. There's a Linux that I played with called cubes, QUBE-OSOS.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:42.080]   And they call it a "reasonably secure operating system." But that's, and Snowden recommends it,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.640]   but the whole point of it is everything is sandboxed. Everything is in a container.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:54.720]   So nothing can, there's no, all the inter-process operations. Rogue process can't impact the rest
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:02.000]   of the operating system. That's the way to do it. For sure, compartmentalization, as you said.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.440]   So, yeah, it would make sense that if you were going to today, or even in 2016,
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:13.520]   start designing an operating system from scratch, you would probably say, yeah, we should compartmentalize
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.880]   everything. So is there anything that informs, I'm going to ask you another question, Stacy,
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   you may not answer it. But is it more in terms of the mobile versus computer
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:32.640]   split that exists now? Does this architecturally give any indication of how we can bring it all together?
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:38.720]   I don't think it's concerned with that. I think it's concerned with running apps on many different
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:46.240]   types of devices. So I guess it would be negating that split. But I don't think it's designed for,
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:54.000]   I mean, I don't know, in our story does not cover the fact, like, I don't know if it's designed to
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.160]   run on a computer. I mean, it could, but I don't know if there's benefits to it.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:05.520]   Or what their goal is, yeah. Yeah. Probably they're not, but who knows, you just don't know.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.920]   Matter support will come to the Nest thermostat. That's good.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:16.720]   Oh, and then the other thing is, remember when Google killed works with Nest like 18 months ago?
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:24.960]   Yeah. So they said the thing that, and so if anyone was using works with Nest to have their
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.720]   Nest devices that were not like the Google Assistant devices, if you were using those devices to
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.960]   control things in your home, you weren't supposed to upgrade your Nest account because you would
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:42.240]   lose that functionality. So Google says that those people who want to use like their Nest cameras
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.160]   to control a smart home process, they can actually do that. They can do up to three of those in,
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.640]   by using what it's called, it's a device access console. You have to pay five bucks,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:59.840]   you become basically a developer for Google, and you jump through a bunch of hoops and then you can
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:08.560]   run your own Nest integrations that were taken away by works with Nest. But you have to build them.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.240]   Google has also, and I suppose this really going to change log, but they've also created a directory
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:24.320]   of smart home devices that work with assistance. So this is the page at assistant.google.com.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:31.440]   Your home can do more, discover smart home devices that work with assistant. So it's actually,
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:39.520]   there's only three. There's more tabs. Oh, look, a big ass fan. Nice.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.680]   Yeah. Sensei. Actually, we have these.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.440]   Yes, fans was one of the original companies that worked with Thread way back when Thread was
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.240]   announced in 2014. They were one of the seven companies who were part of it.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.640]   And anything that works with Thread will work with Chip now or whatever the matter.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:05.840]   Is that right? Matter. So we're waiting theoretically. I say this because Apple right now says they're
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.520]   putting on their stuff that the home kit stuff that it's a home kit Thread. I'm hoping that goes
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.200]   away. That's a question I've asked Apple, but you know, Apple, they're just like,
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:21.840]   ha, ha, ha, ha, we'll tell you when we're ready. So Roku is on this list. How would Roku,
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:31.120]   how what would you get with Roku? Did you see Yanko's story? No, Yanko Rethkers. He no longer
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:39.600]   works at the right. Now he works where protocol. So he wrote a story this week at yesterday.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.880]   Roku is getting into the smart home. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why there are members here. Look at
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:55.280]   that. Fancy. Roku wants to expand his vaccine commercial. I've missed that. Sorry to mention
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.600]   the vaccination. Yeah, let's not mention that. Companies IoT plans include both part issues
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.880]   and musicals all state off partnerships and products developed in house. That's it. I mean,
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.920]   why not? I mean, they've kind of gotten to the end of the line on what you can do with a set top
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.120]   box. So that makes sense. Yeah. And AV is the missing. I mean, really, unless you go with a
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.760]   professional installer, AV is the missing component, especially since Logitech killed their Harmony
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:31.520]   remote. Yes. Oh, man. Yes. We're all like, oh, sadness. So in a way, Apple led the way with this
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.160]   because the Apple TV is a hub for home kit. So this isn't that far-fetched. I didn't leave the way.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.360]   Please. Well, who else has a TV device that's a hub for your smart home?
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.560]   All of the display companies out there? Oh, okay. They all want to be the hub for home automation.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.680]   Yeah. I mean, they're just not a TV, but I mean, I watch YouTube on my Google display.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.720]   Yeah. Oh, you're right. You mean like the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max? Those are
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.320]   hubs. Yeah. Are they Android? The Echo shows? I don't think of them as TVs, but you're right.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:16.640]   I can watch clips from YouTube. You can see your doorbells on them. Yeah. What I say,
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.720]   TV, like the AV side being missing, I'm thinking about things like, you know,
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:27.040]   Madam A, turn on my, you know, turn on Netflix. I used to have that when I had the Logitech remote,
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:34.960]   but when that died, Amazon's FireCube does that. You know, it's a FireTV device. You don't like it.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.880]   I didn't think that thing is sold. They're still selling it as far as I know.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:48.000]   I like it because I could walk in a room and say, turn on the TV and turn to NFL, you know,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.080]   it's a 49ers game. I like that. And you can do it with routines, I think, with a Chromecast on a
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.240]   Google display. The shoot did it the old school way with IR blasters and stuff. So it really wasn't
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.680]   a smart home device. It was really a big difference. Yeah. It was more like the harmony, actually.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:12.400]   Yeah. But it was a cube and it had it at Madam A and you could talk to it and you could turn off
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.240]   the TV or turn up the TV and things like that. I like that. All right. So Roku's, that's when you
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.080]   say Roku's getting to home automation, it's at a level like that. Well, we don't know, but my
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.800]   suspicion is there's a hole in the market and Roku is a logical company to fill that hole.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.920]   To come out with lights, I'm going to be like, why Roku? Why?
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.520]   I love it. The Jeff Jarvis has written a thank you note to the internet.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:48.880]   Order the card from this collection, by the way, beyond grateful. Thank you so very much.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:54.320]   And you make a good point, Jeff. This would have been a lot tougher year. I mean, it was tough,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.000]   particularly for young people, but it would have been a lot tougher if we didn't have the internet.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.560]   It just take a moment, take a moment and think of what the pandemic would have been like without
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.320]   the net. Think of all the things that it did well and how people used it well for that.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.480]   And so what I argue is the net needs, you know, you know, much stick. The net's yet young. We have
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.400]   a lot of time. It's early Gutenberg years. But as we talk about how to think about the next
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.880]   generation of the net, the starting point, which I every conference I go to now is well, it's all
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.240]   messed up. It's all bad. It's terrible. It caused. And then then the then the ideas are all incremental
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:39.440]   and small. And if we start instead with what do we want it to be? What do we want it to do for us?
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.160]   It's a different conversation. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying there aren't tons of things
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.400]   to fix. Of course there are. They're not saying that the current proprietors don't need to do a
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.080]   hell of a lot more. They absolutely do. But let's have a discussion about what we want it to be.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:16:00.720]   And that's my point. And you thank you for leaving us out of this. You say in every panel
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.480]   and conference I watched and that's stupid show I do call this week at Google.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.960]   Oh, no. It's like a voice in here. The starting point of the discussion about the net is what's
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.000]   wrong with it. And you also, I saw you tweet where you said, Hey, you know, I know a lot of people
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.480]   lost their jobs during COVID. But a lot more would have if it hadn't been for the internet and the
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.160]   ability to work from home and things like that. That's a very important. That's true. Parents
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.520]   will stay at home. Students able to continue studying family and family and I mean, Leah and I are old
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.760]   enough to remember. Can you get off that phone? It's long distance. Oh God. Yeah. Science and
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.400]   doctors doing amazing work able to share information through preprint servers and everything commerce
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.840]   continuing. I got food to my 95 year old father in Florida. The great miracle. In fact, Andy,
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.400]   Weir was talking about this. I interviewed him for a triangulation, the author of Project
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.680]   Hail Mary and the Martian. He said, you know, people forget we invented a new way of making
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.360]   vaccines called MRNA that probably will end pandemics forever that they're going to change
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:10.080]   medicine forever. So technology is not just the internet technology. Very much saved us in this.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.880]   And let's look to after the murder of George Floyd and the fact that we all unfortunately
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.920]   were able to witness it. The movements spread across the world at long last on a racial
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:30.320]   reformation capital R. Of course, we also bring up the fact that the internet propagated QAnon and
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.920]   the stop the steel and all that. I stipulate I stipulate that but but you can't help yourself.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.440]   You just can't help yourself. Well, it's a mixed blessing.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:48.320]   But it's a mixed blessing. I acknowledge all of that. But but I think that my point is made.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.600]   If we if we start the discussion differently, then then to me, it's more than about fixing the
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.520]   problems. It's more than about adapting an existing institution. It's what can we do with it? And
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:05.120]   I you know, one of the great things for the pandemic for me is as a silver lining was I finished writing
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.240]   my manuscript. Still waiting to sell it, trying to hear back from the publisher
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.240]   on the end of the Gutenberg age. But that gave me a lot of perspective. Yeah, that's a useful
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:21.440]   perspective. And you you know, I think both they're not incompatible views. No, they're not.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.080]   The internet has been a I mean, technology general. That's why I cover technologies,
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:33.120]   an amazing transformative thing that's happened. That's as big as if not bigger than the industrial
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:39.680]   revolution, certainly as big as the Gutenberg revolution. But there's also consequences, just as,
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:46.720]   you know, the, you know, discovering discovery, discovery of nuclear fission had some benefits,
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:50.320]   but also had some negatives. Nothing's perfect in this world.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.400]   Dr. Einstein, well, we have to be, but you know, frankly, we have to be cognizant of both.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.360]   So and I agree with you that perhaps we talk too much about the negative and don't spend enough
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.280]   time acknowledging. Let's let's imagine what we can do. So it's nice to think of course,
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.840]   I want to create with Doug Rushkoff. Doug Rushkoff is a guy who wrote throwing rocks at the Google
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.440]   bus. So he and I have to reviews the things he's also in CUNY. I'd love to start one around
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.160]   designing the internet we want, whether that means you're designing a feature or a company or a
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:24.640]   regulation or a set of standards. Let's start, you know, presuming our agency with it. Yeah,
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.320]   thank you for the time on this. Yeah, rush cuff is a great guy. I didn't realize you worked with
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.840]   him. That's very interesting. He's been college and I'm at the journals. Yeah, very interesting. Yeah.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:43.920]   And he's been around like you a long time. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, he's younger than me. So you're
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.000]   actually right. So there's a little dispute in Washington. What a surprise. The DC attorney
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.800]   general is suing Amazon because he says the prices are too high. But Biden's antitrust people
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:04.080]   says say Amazon's prices are too low. They're so confused. It's the new anti trust paradox
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:12.240]   rice, Casey Newton and platformer. So so which is it, you know, I would tell you, but I I'm not
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.520]   subscribing to subscribe. You know what? This is like, I had three in a row. The great Casey
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.960]   Newton pieces. I just he's good. He's actually done doing really great stuff as a solo artist. Yeah,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:30.640]   really is. Yeah. It isn't very interesting. So the the and I think the DC attorney general is going
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:42.880]   to have a tough uphill road on this one. He's basically saying Amazon tells sellers what to charge.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:49.440]   They did until 2019 have a clause in their contracts with third party sellers saying,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:55.440]   and by the way, this in my mind is quite reasonable that you can't undercut the prices you're using
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.600]   on Amazon. You can't go off and sell it for less somewhere else. Amazon did, I think, discover in
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:10.240]   2019 that that is in fact, a tr anti trust violation. So they they pulled it out, but they did kind of
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:19.600]   leave in something similar called a fair pricing policy that lets them quote, impose sanctions on
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.800]   a seller that offers their product for a lower price. And that's what the DC attorney general is
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:31.600]   using as saying that's price fixing. And that's illegal. Amazon says the the DC attorney general
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.720]   has it exactly backwards. Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.240]   Amazon takes pride in the fact we offer low prices across the broadest selection. And like any store,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.680]   we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are night priced competitively.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.280]   So the which if I may if I may insert right there, which is really interesting, I think it was Casey
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.120]   who raised this, there's a section 230 angle over that. You can't tell us what we have to promote.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:05.600]   Right. Yeah, I mean, and it is a benefit to consumers. Absolutely. So I'm not sure really,
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:11.040]   I mean, okay, maybe it's a technical violation of the Sherman anti trust tech, but I I think it's
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:18.800]   be this guy's gonna be hard pressed to prove harm. Carl Racine, the Washington DC attorney general,
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.240]   and it is ironic that that's exactly the opposite opposite.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.720]   I was paying this legal bill.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.520]   Who racines or Amazon's? Racines.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.360]   Uh, it's the taxpayers. Because it's because it's because it's because he's
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:41.440]   getting all of us. Yeah. Which is why this angers me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   maybe it's show boating. And certainly that would not be the first time a state attorney would
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.280]   show boat or would show boat. I don't know. It doesn't bother me that Amazon, I can understand
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.240]   why Amazon would say we don't want you on. Well, maybe I'm violating any trust. We tell the same
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:04.880]   thing to advertisers. If you give us a discount, please don't offer one lower. But the reason we
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:11.120]   say that is because our audience is not stupid. They'll go, they'll find the lower price. So please
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.360]   give us the best deal you've got. We don't enforce it in any way. And sometimes people do, in fact,
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.600]   undercut their, their deals, but we don't like it. People give Amazon a lot of grief because they're
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.800]   big tech and they definitely have their problems. But they also give a lot of small businesses,
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.840]   a bit of a lifeline to be able to have their products distributed through, you know, through
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.040]   them and to a lot more people that they're not necessarily able to get right here in Sonoma County
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:47.280]   as a small business. Yeah. I have a feeling this suit is not going to go very far, but we'll see.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:53.040]   No. We'll see. I would go about as far as Florida's, uh, pro-Disney.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.720]   Oh my God. How long before that's challenged in, uh, and quick?
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.640]   Mike Masnick had a great, uh, tweet this week. Just part of me, I'll be gone for a little bit. I'm
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:09.840]   buying a theme park. Yeah. It's protected. Uh, yeah. The, uh, we talked about before, but the,
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.480]   and by the way, that Florida bill has now been passed, uh, and signed into law. Uh, it does exempt
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:23.840]   anybody who owns an amusement park, AKA Disney because, well, that's the home of, uh, Disney world.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:32.000]   Uh, but the, it says that if you, uh, you'll be fined $250,000 for every day, any social media
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.560]   site will be fined for every day more than two weeks that a statewide political candidate is banned.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.960]   Obviously, uh, in direct response to Trump's banning on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:52.480]   Um, and as numerous people pointed out, it violates section 230. It probably violates the
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.600]   constitution. Um, not necessarily the first amendment, but the constitutional prohibition against
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:05.120]   states regulating interstate commerce. Um, I can't imagine this will survive in court, but no,
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:13.920]   but well, I mean, with the courts we got now, who knows? I think, uh, there's a lot of performative
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:21.280]   stuff in politics these days. And it's a lot of it is aimed towards one guy in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.920]   Uh, Ron DeSantis just wants to send a message to the Donald that, um, I'm on your corner.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:35.360]   You know, which I don't, I honestly don't get to this extent. He's, now he's off Twitter, he's
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:42.320]   off Facebook. He's virtually silent. Is he powerless? No, that's I feel like these politicians must be,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:50.080]   they must be, um, testing the win. I don't, I don't think it's a C. I think it's the idea of him.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.240]   I think it's, I think it's, that he's getting the benefit of it.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:59.040]   Simple. Yeah. Yeah. And he raises money for himself and all that, but he's a symbol of,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:04.960]   uh, you know, being able to say nasty things or whatever. Uh, but, but the idea that he himself
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:12.240]   right now is wielding power. I don't see it. I should, I just don't want this cat to end up being a
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.600]   martyr. Oh, he's going to be that no matter what. That's his thing. That's his stick.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.840]   He's the ultimate victim. There's never been anybody better at saying, Oh man,
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.320]   no one's ever had it been treated worse than me. He's like the Rodney Dangerfield of politics.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.920]   Yeah. But yeah, but you can't win that one.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.200]   And he is going to be a part of no matter what that would come to their senses and not give him
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.640]   that much. We just, we just, we just, he who shall be named. Well, I wish that too, but here we are
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.200]   in the year of our Lord 2021 in the U S of A. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I had a, I had a big
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.840]   freight the other day. I thought we all thought it was 2020. It's 2020. What if it's the 2020s?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.920]   You're in me? Oh, we're done with 2020. It's over. There's something stupid happened.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.880]   We're getting the whole decade. Yeah. It's the whole damn 2020s. Oh, no.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.960]   The caters are cool. Why are we so against the cicadas?
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   You crunch on them on your sidewalk in about two days. I have, I have dealt with cicadas
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.120]   and I've dealt with the annual onslaught of crickets in Austin. Believe me, I know it's kind of like,
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.720]   eh, but it's also pretty awesome. I had to come up with something. Yes, I know. I know. I had to
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:28.960]   just open it. Actually, completely unrelated. What? What? What? What cicadas?
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.040]   Cicadas? I got related to anything. Well, no, it is related to cicadas, actually.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.800]   Somebody is somebody posted on Twitter the one time. Let me just see if I've got
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:49.680]   socks on here. The, the, I can, I can, yeah, I can, I can install this here. Let me just quickly
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:56.240]   install this. I can make a, uh, since this starts, I can make my, I can make my, uh,
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.480]   my computer populate a cicadas breeding sound. Do you want to hear it?
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:07.520]   Sure. That's it. That sounds like the X files. I know it's good, isn't it?
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.080]   This is a, uh, a Linux one liner. If anybody wants it, I'll, uh,
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.160]   if you're on to the sound moment in the show, I direct you to line one for, I have another
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.560]   sound moment. All right. Let me stop the cicadas though. That does sound, doesn't sound like cicadas,
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.120]   they're, they're lower, but maybe this is the brooding cicadas of the sound.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.880]   The X cicadas? Yeah. They're, they're brooding. Do you know what that is?
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.720]   Brooding cicadas. It's the 10th.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.280]   They're brooding. They're breeding. Are they breeding? Right. Like they're,
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.840]   they're up in your, they're up in Jeff's neck of the woods, right? And then they come out every
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.320]   17 years. This is the 10th year. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're going to hit by some. Sorry.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.440]   The 10th generation. So this is like locusts. They're going to, they're back.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.760]   17 years. Oh, that's interesting. 13. Oh, I didn't realize that.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.360]   And there's other broods like there's broods in other parts of the country that'll emerge at
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.880]   certain times too. So well, as long as yes, when we don't go down for that long, we're in the audio
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.880]   portion of the show. The Google doodle today is an audio doodle. Oh, yes. Here. Let me, let me,
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:19.280]   press play. It's put your rhythm to the test as we celebrate swing dancing and the Savoy ballroom.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.800]   All right. Shall we play the two player? No, we'll do the one player game. Press the matching keys in
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.440]   time with the note. Are you ready to play? This is Ella and Louie. And the keys are F, D, J, and K.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:38.800]   Yes. Here comes the note. F, J, D,
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:46.080]   D, this was my wedding song. Really? This is the song my husband and I dance too. Okay. Well,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.840]   you got to play this, man. This is F. No, that's what we walk around to. This is our first dance.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.200]   See, I'm losing and I feel like I'm winning. Did you jitterball?
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:04.080]   That sort of probably going to get taken down. How can they take me down for something that's
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:10.560]   on a Google doodle? No, they won't. They can't. YouTube, watch YouTube do it. Anyway,
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.120]   it's fun. If you get a chance to play, it's great music and it's the Google doodle. They're
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:21.040]   celebrating the Savoy ballroom. I don't know why. Today would have been Miles Davis's birthday.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:28.960]   Really? Little great Miles Davis. May 26 1926 is when he was born. Well, the Savoy ballroom was
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:35.040]   we're talking about. He's less swinging more jazz, but you know, it was in Harlem and it was one of
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:41.360]   the first racially integrated public spaces in United States history where black people and white
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:50.000]   people could go to dance together and sing. You say potato and I say potato. Yeah, neither
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   my husband or I when we picked that as our song to dance to realize that the the chorus is let's
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.240]   call the whole thing off. Yeah, you missed that part. We just caught on to the fact that we often,
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:08.800]   I say tomato, he says tomato. It's a it was from a Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers movie. I think it was
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:15.600]   a Gershwin song. I try to remember it was swing time. It's a great scene, actually, if you ever get
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:23.520]   a chance to to see that, let's see, let's call the is a Gershwin. Maybe it's Gershwin. Maybe it's
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:29.440]   Gershwin. I think it is. Gershwin, what? Porgy and best. Yeah, this song isn't from there, but
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:35.600]   that was your porgy. That was your effort to make, make Jeff out of gift. They're, they're, they're
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:41.440]   roller skating or as you kids would call it roller blading. Most aiding and blading are different.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:47.040]   They're skating. They got four wheels. They're skating, but you'd figure Fred and Ginger could
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:54.480]   probably pull it off pretty well, right? This would probably get flagged. This is one of my
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.760]   favorite movies of all time. Man, the thirties were good. Remember those, Jeff?
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.520]   The depression. I was only the depression.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:14.640]   It's from the movie Shall We Dance, 1937. A very good year. That was the year I married my first wife.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:25.520]   So you want line 14, 100 14 or not? Yeah, we're doing audio. It's our audio daily double and line
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:34.400]   114. You're going to love this. This is, this is, oh yeah, I, we've actually played this on
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:38.560]   Windows Weekly a while ago. Cause they did, no, no, no, I'll do a few of these. They do,
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:44.960]   the windows boot up sounds and everything. This is a, this is a South Korean
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:52.320]   acapella group called Maytree and they do, they do a lot of different, you want to show
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.200]   you the, the Skype one? Is that the one you like? Let me see here. They got PlayStation.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:07.520]   They got. Windows XP. Where's Skype? I see zoom. Huh. Maybe if I go to their YouTube channel
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:14.960]   or it's Instagram story has a since no, I clicked it. Here's the Skype here. Let's see. Here's the best.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:18.000]   Oh, oh, oh. Where's my audio?
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.760]   Yeah. I'm talking.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:25.600]   Snapchat. That's Snapchat. Wow.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:36.000]   Oh, I hate this. My, my, my daughter calls me the whole house fills with that.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:44.800]   That's Google do a messenger. What's happening? Wow. They're really good. They are really good.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:52.960]   Oh, they didn't get to Skype. They skipped Skype. Let me, let me go back here and do it again.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:34:00.080]   Let's see. Purposely skip Skype. Go forward a lot. That's Hangouts. That's not so good.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:10.000]   I love their faces. They're so cute. That's fine Skype, which is my favorite song. In fact,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.200]   I'll probably sing along with Skype. Okay. Just if you're listening at home, don't worry.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.040]   Your phone is not ringing.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:26.160]   Isn't that great? God, we know that sound way too well. Way too well.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.000]   I'm proud of you here, especially. Yeah.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.880]   Here, here's the Windows XP ones. What? That's the best one.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.160]   So good. It's pretty good. Vista.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.280]   USB.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:53.680]   That's the error trash can.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.200]   The happiest.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:09.600]   That is pretty awesome. That was our sound portion of our show today.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.120]   The rest of the show will be all silent.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.240]   No, one other sound here.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.720]   Oh, silent. He never said Charlie, bit my finger.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.760]   Oh, this was a shocker and very.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.480]   This was very and you can't find it anymore because it's been sold as an NFT.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:36.720]   And there is apparently hidden versions of it on YouTube. They said that I'd be peeved
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.360]   if I bought it for half a billion pounds to find that Charlie, bit my finger is still hanging around.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:51.440]   Let me ask you, isn't that what the Internet Archive is for? Yeah, everything's there.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.040]   The kids are all grown up. They're in their fifties now and doing quite well.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.000]   Wouldn't it be on Internet Archive? I don't know. Seems like you could find just not anything
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.080]   out there. It seems like that's exactly what the Internet Archive was invented for, doesn't it?
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:16.800]   We talked about it and they talked about how they're going to take it off of YouTube forever.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.240]   I'm like, yeah, you can take it off of YouTube, but that doesn't mean that's the Internet.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:28.640]   Oh, I know. They actually have a website, Charlie Bitme. The auction has ended.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:36.800]   Oh, Charlie, Charlie bit my finger. Wait a minute. The final bit was $760,000.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:43.360]   Why would somebody do that? That's nuts. Anyway, I'm glad the kids got some money.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.160]   You don't even really need to hear it. You know it. It's in your head. Just watch it.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.800]   So the video is still there, but the audio is fun. Yeah. Charlie bit my finger.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.320]   So he didn't say that. He didn't say that. He's Charlie Bitme.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.600]   You know, it's called Charlie Bitme finger.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:09.440]   Fascinating. I'm searching archive.org. See if you can find it, Ant.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.520]   Yeah, there it is. Funny or die.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:20.240]   Oh, there's no preview. It's got to do it. Please download the file. So yeah, there's a very,
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.840]   very careful. If you post a picture on Instagram of your favorite blue cheese,
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:32.400]   if you post it with a picture of your fingers, you might get in trouble.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:38.720]   This fella, who is apparently a fan of a very good mature blue stilton from Lester Sure.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:45.200]   I love stilton posted a picture on an encrypted message service called encroach at turns out.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:52.160]   Who else is on encroach at the po po? I was gonna say the FBI's. They were able to analyze his
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.280]   fingerprints. He was just sentenced to 13 years and six months in Liverpool prison,
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.480]   pleading guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin, MDMA, and ketamine.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:09.360]   And stilton. And apparently stilton stilton. He's such a fan of stilton that he thought
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.800]   oh, I'll just post this picture. No one will know it's me except apparently you can see the wars,
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:22.480]   whorls and patterns of his fingerprints and the police got it. So he's on this site. Like,
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:30.880]   how does the police know to check his? They had a they had a he so this site he used this site
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:37.120]   encroach at to sell drugs. Got it. Okay. And I was like, where's the connection? And then they were
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.800]   apparently the police, you know, you think it's encrypted. Well, the police can't figure that out.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:46.800]   And so the police were on it. And they saw that the same guy, Tophie force,
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.680]   was also a cheese fan. And we're able to put two and two together.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.600]   And they could get a fingerprint off the photo. Yeah, they actually got him, which is kind of
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:03.440]   okay. Don't do this. Don't do this. Did you I heard about this? I meant to ask my son. He was
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:10.000]   in LA over the weekend. I wonder if he went to the Huntington Beach party. This is
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.720]   the owner run down because it's social media. Tic Toc. This is what's wrong with the internet.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:26.880]   Okay. So it was a 17th birthday party for a young man, which unfortunately,
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:36.640]   to which the invite got posted. I think on Tic Toc or Instagram and 2,500 people from all over
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.960]   the world showed up. It turned into a riot. People, many people got arrested.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:53.840]   Huntington Beach police, police department requested assistance from outside agencies over 150
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.560]   officers from all the agencies within Orange County went to Huntington Beach.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:07.200]   An emergency curfew was issued. 121 adults, 28 juveniles arrested, booked for vandalism,
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.040]   fireworks, failure to disperse and curfew violations. No serious. Is this at his house?
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:26.160]   No, this is downtown. Police said they knew about the post and made preparations.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.840]   Do not post your party invitations on Tic Toc.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:36.720]   Did that person do it or did someone of his friends do? They thought they didn't think people
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.000]   would show up to it. I don't blame them. I would who would know that that people go,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.720]   "Let's go to Huntington Beach." That's the good and the bad of the internet.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.600]   Probably got a lot more people to this person's party. It could have been a great time and
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.240]   something they would always remember. Then the foolishness happened and it devolves within minutes,
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.480]   unfortunately, the good and the bad of these platforms. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.840]   little time out, a little breather so the Stacy can go get a waffle.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:22.240]   When we return, it will be time for the Google change log. Are you all waffled up, Stacy? Are you
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:28.480]   ready to come over? That was a faux break. You can come get a waffle. I'll wait.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:34.960]   No, no, no. You don't start the change log. I got nothing to add. It's time for
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:48.880]   the Google change log. Like the guy said, June 15th, that's the end of the line for free Google photos.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:56.400]   Unless what? The fastest change log. It's okay. It's okay. It's all you need to know.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:07.280]   I didn't give my waffle that time either. Actually, June 1st, next week, the Google Photos policy change.
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:12.640]   No longer will you have free unlimited storage for high quality or compressed photos from that
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.400]   date unless you own a pixel phone from the two onward. I do. Thank goodness. However,
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:25.680]   everything you got there so far up to June 1st will stay, right? So you should really upload all
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:35.120]   your photos today. Get it done, folks. Any existing high quality photos and videos or exempt from
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.520]   the change won't count toward the free 15 gigabyte storage that you get with a Google account.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.960]   But anything new you upload will count against your storage from June 1st. So if you want to use
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.160]   it like you've been using it, you'll have to pay for that storage. Google Photos has offered a new
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.320]   weeding tool. And the Google said, "Today we're starting to roll out a tool in the Photos app
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.840]   to help you easily manage the photos and videos you've backed up that count toward your storage
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.920]   quota." Which is like going through your email. Well, it's automated, which is good.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:14.240]   Fixing your bookmarks. Yeah. Nobody's going to do it. It will surface blurry photos, screenshots,
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.520]   large videos. That's actually a big one on me because I had turned on video uploads. So it's
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.520]   uploaded to every video I've ever taken from the last... Any whiteboard pictures?
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:29.920]   Whiteboard pictures. Yeah. It hasn't rolled out in all devices, but when it does, you'll find it by
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.600]   clicking on your account in the top right hand corner of the library section and tapping "Storage."
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Then you'll see "Manage Storage." And you should see new sections, including blurry photos.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:47.440]   Actually, you know what? They should have done this years ago. I can't wait to delete my blurry photos.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:54.800]   I've got fun. Are these to my wife? Are these bananas green enough for you?
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:01.040]   Pictures. Oh, yeah. Right. I do that all the time. But those, it's not probably going to
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:07.440]   highlight. Anyway, it's so annoying trying to get rid of all of those one-offs too.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:15.280]   The picture... Anybody else downloaded Android 12 yet? I've been playing with a little bit. I like it.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:23.520]   I'm a little gun shy with betas. There have been people who have bricked their phones.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:31.440]   XDA developers says, "You should use DFU to install the update, not just the OTA update that
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.800]   Google offers." That's what I did. Had no problems on my Pixel 4 XL. But they say, "If you use DFU,
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:44.720]   you can roll it back." So maybe that's the device firmware update technique. It's explained on
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:52.880]   xda-developers.com. Pixel launcher discover feed on Android 12 can be themed by doodles in a
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:59.200]   material you like manner, according to Abner Lee writing for 9 to 5 Google. I don't even know what
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:05.360]   any of those words mean, but I was hoping you would consider that. They briefly spoke about
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.280]   material you. They're an I/O, but it just sounded sort of... They don't yet have that really nice
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.080]   wallpaper changer feature. That's the one I'm looking forward to, because I don't want to spend a lot
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.800]   of time theming. But if it will take my wallpaper and change my colors, that's nice.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:31.200]   You know that page that we all have that Google has that shows you your searches?
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:39.920]   Web and app activity? That pretty much anybody who has your phone or your browser could probably
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.720]   just go there and look at all your searches. I'm going to take a chance here and go to activity.google.com
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:53.520]   and see all my searches. You can now password protect that. You might want to.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:46:02.000]   I thought it already was. No, it's not. Well, it is in the sense that you have to be logged in,
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.800]   but most of us log in on our browser, right? And it's always logged in. So if somebody got my phone
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.800]   or my set down on my computer, I'd be logged into my Google account and they could just go to...
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.680]   On my phone, yeah, I would definitely still be logged in, but on the computer, no, I always log out.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:24.800]   That's a lot of work. It's habit. I do not... I leave myself logged in everywhere. I'm logged in right
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.960]   here. So as you can see, I searched for Charlie, but my finger earlier today. I searched for...
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.040]   So John's saying, "You sure you want to show this?" I don't think I searched for...
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.680]   Slow down, sir. Slow to scroll. I think I searched for anything bad.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:47.200]   I think I'm okay. Anyway, you might want to password protect it because, well, your searches say a lot
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:54.000]   about you, don't they? True. That's exactly what Google says to all of its people buying ads.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.200]   One more photos thing and then we'll wrap this thing up. If you have Gmail attachments,
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:09.520]   finally, you could save it to your photos in mobile. Holy cow, how long is that? We've went for that.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:16.720]   Only JPEG images are currently supported, but if there is a photo in your email, you can now
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:22.720]   save it to Google Photos instead of downloading and importing. And then uploaded it. Yes, that's such a
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:36.960]   pain. And that's the Google change law. ScooterX just posted something in the chat. First physical
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:44.640]   Google store, open in NYC. We have that. Yeah, that's in our Quick Takes section.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.120]   They've had... They've had... They've had... They've had...
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:55.360]   Section? Yes. That's something new. And this is... Oh, okay. It's time for the Twig change log.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:02.640]   For all four of you who read the Twig rundown, we now have a top stories and Quick Takes section
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.440]   because Leo is missing big stories. I was going to say, is that because Jason's like,
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.240]   don't talk for too long about this. It is stupid. No, no, Jason and I collaborate,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:21.760]   but I have a tag. I say, this was going in top or this one's a Quick Take. And Jason agrees.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:26.960]   This is a Quick Take. Nicely done. Google, I put a fair amount of stuff on the rundown. I don't
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.840]   presume to put it in either. Please don't. I'll put it wherever and then I figure you and Jason.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.240]   Jason will move it around. I don't make a judgment. It was like the green, but we had green boxes for
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.760]   a while. Yeah, the problem with the green boxes is they were... Tell us that some of my stories
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.000]   didn't get big boxes. They were all spread around. And so I was missing Greenbox stories,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.240]   so we thought of a new way to do this. And that's your Twig change log.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:55.120]   I have to say Google has had brick and mortar stores many times before. So I don't know why
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.080]   this is new. Only as pop-ups, I think this is a permanent one.
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.800]   Okay. They had a brick and mortar store in Austin for Google Fiber.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.960]   They had at the Oakland airport for a long time. You could do a Chromebook. See, I've never seen
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:16.960]   this store. It's always been the internet fiber, never something in this 4-actually Google hardware.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.560]   Yeah, they haven't had a retail like this. They haven't had a lot of hardware, if you remember.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.120]   Other than Pixel phones. They've launched. I wish they had more. Pixel smartphones,
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:35.360]   Pixelbooks, Fitbits, Nest, Smart Home devices. There'll be customer service
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.600]   right there. You can make online orders, pick them up at the store, kind of like Apple does.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:44.000]   I should point out Microsoft closed all of its retail locations not so long ago, but
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.440]   maybe Google's too better. All of them? Yeah. They closed the whole thing? Wow.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.360]   Shout it all down. I always had so many stores that I had. I do remember seeing a Microsoft store.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.560]   I'd walk by there and those geeks are just kind of twiddling their thumbs and you go by the Apple
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.720]   store. It was so quiet. It was so quiet. It was so bad. Yeah, it was really bad.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:06.720]   And often Microsoft built the Microsoft store across the way from across the whole.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.480]   Yeah. So that comparison was even more. The price was all the worst.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:16.080]   Pathetic. Google has been fine. Big fine in Russia.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:28.080]   $81,000 for the... I don't even know. It's like, oh, it costs us too much to read it, check. We'll just
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.520]   get to big fine in it. Yeah, well, it would be a lot for me.
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:42.160]   Just give me Google+. Roskom Nodzor. Russia Media Watch Jug said they gave Google 24 hours to
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:47.520]   delete videos that contain drugs, violence, and extremism. They fail to do so. That's going to cost
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:53.600]   you 6 million rubles. Oh, Ruble ate what it used to be.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:58.720]   I was going to say, how much is a Ruble worth? Yeah, 81,000 total.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:05.840]   I'm not even going to talk about the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:15.280]   It's just a Camara. It's exactly what it is. Not a Camaro. That's a car from Chevrolet.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.280]   Yes. It's a Camara, which is something you're not going to...
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:26.320]   I say Camara, but I don't really know. Let's check the...
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:34.960]   Say again? What is it? Camara. Camara. Camara. Is that like an I'mira?
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.760]   Nope, it's not. No, it's according to Greek mythology, a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:45.520]   creature of lycea composed of the parts of more than one animal. But really, the reason we use that
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:50.400]   is it's something imaginary, illusory, impossible to achieve. Camara.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:56.240]   Oh, okay. The Pixel 6. What is it? Camara. That's what it is.
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:11.840]   India rated the Delhi Twitter office kind of the same reason Russia doesn't like Google.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.320]   There was no one there, but they made their point.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:24.640]   Is that really? News cameras were in tow because they wouldn't take down tweets that bothered
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:32.320]   Modi. It was a symbolic message, the Prime Minister. They've been putting pressure...
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.080]   The Twitter change log. There's a Twitter change log?
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:38.480]   Let's do it. Now apply. And now...
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.960]   Now the Twitter change log.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.280]   I can play cicadas again if you want.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:47.040]   Do they set...
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:47.600]   Please, no.
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.560]   Okay.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.160]   Let's call the whole thing off. Is that what you're saying?
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:53:00.800]   Twitter has previewed ticketed spaces, but I have to love the way they did this because it
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:08.320]   really was a little bit of shade at the Apple Epic battle because basically, spaces will allow
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:16.800]   you to charge for an event or a stream or whatever. So you can host paid gatherings.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.040]   Twitter will take 20%, but if people are paying on an iPhone, Apple will take 30%.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:29.280]   And you'll get whatever's left after all of that. You'll get about half of it.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:36.720]   It says you can earn up to 80% up to 80% of the revenue on ticket sales after platform fees
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.240]   are deducted by Apple and Google on the Epic purchases.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:46.000]   The math is way too complicated, but it is interesting. I guess this is a way for...
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.640]   As Twitter charged for anything in the past, this is the first, right?
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:51.040]   Negative.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.840]   So...
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.800]   This is just a shot in the dark. They haven't implemented this yet, right?
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:01.440]   Space has been around, but the...
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.800]   No, no, I need to get paid.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:04.320]   The paid version.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:07.360]   Get ready.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.960]   This will...
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:17.600]   Will users in the US will be able to apply to host paid live audio rooms in the next couple of weeks.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.160]   And I think that makes sense.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:26.000]   They don't want just anybody doing it, I guess, because it saves them
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.360]   headache and money with all of the hosting and so forth.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.600]   So make sure it's somebody that's actually notable and actually going to get some people in to
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:40.240]   draw some funds where they can get their cut, because I guess that makes more sense.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.200]   Not just anybody.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.440]   New York Times, I thought... I misread this.
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.920]   I thought it said the New York Times was in talks to buy the Atlantic, but it's actually the
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.240]   athletic. What the hell is the athletic?
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.080]   Even though I'm not a jock and I don't want the athletic.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.680]   Oh, is it a website?
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.640]   It's a huge...
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.400]   I thought it was a magazine at one time, wasn't it?
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:07.680]   No, it's been a site. They stole basically every beloved sports writer across the country.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.280]   Oh, this is a...
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.640]   Okay.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:11.360]   This is the site.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.720]   I thought they were old magazine.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.640]   Athletic laid off 46 people last June, but ended up hiring about double that number back last year.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.120]   They're huge.
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:21.520]   They have...
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.560]   They're the darling of subscriptions.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.080]   Oh, can't we be like the athletic?
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.640]   Because they got all these sports writers and jock people like that.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.160]   I don't get it, but they do.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.480]   And so they competed with every newspaper out there.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:41.440]   They took their talent and built the athletic opponent.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.360]   Is it for athletic supporters?
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:46.640]   Rimschach.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.680]   I think that's why they named it the athletic.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:54.480]   The only thing is you may be old, but he never grows up.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:05.520]   Yeah, I guess... I mean, that's not so interesting in sports that I would go to a general sports thing.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.600]   Plus, it's a subscription.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:08.720]   I'm specific.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.320]   It's a huge success story.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.880]   I mean, that's the market for that, though.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:21.360]   The way ESPN is quite polarizing, because again, they are the world of sports news,
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.720]   however they quote themselves.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.760]   But they have a lot of people that love them, but just as many people that hate them
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.400]   because of the way they sensationalize a lot of the different events in the sports world.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.320]   And maybe something like the athletic is the better way to go,
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.200]   whereas it's a pure journalistic approach to it and not a whole bunch of fluff.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:45.440]   Because if you turn on Instagram or whatever and go to ESPN,
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:52.080]   everything's just slam-dunked, home runs, and really no meat to the story about the game that happened.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.920]   It's just, you know, flash.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.160]   So that's Aunt Prud, our sport ball, car spot.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:02.720]   I was like, I have nothing to add here.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.520]   Aunt?
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.840]   Bravo.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.560]   Bravo.
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:07.040]   Well done.
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.480]   We're all going.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:09.360]   Come on!
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.560]   What the hell was that?
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.040]   I don't know.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.040]   When I hear sports, I just zone out.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.320]   I just complete these zones.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:22.560]   As a child, my greatest trauma was going to the barbershop.
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.080]   There were still barbershops then.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:24.480]   Because they...
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:24.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.280]   Hey, hey kid, how about them bullies?
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.240]   See, I had a very similar experience, except it was,
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:33.840]   "Hey kid, how about them playboys?"
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.400]   What?
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:40.880]   I'd go to the barbershop and there's girly magazines in there,
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.120]   and it's like, I was not prepared for this.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:47.440]   I'd rather talk about sports, thank you very much.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:54.240]   I think that's pretty much everything we were going to talk about today.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.240]   Would you like to move along to our picks of the week?
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.400]   Yes!
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:00.880]   Did you have...
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.640]   You scared me?
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:03.840]   Okay.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.360]   All right, picks of the week.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.640]   I'm so excited about mine.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:11.440]   Stacey Higginbotham is so excited about her pick of the week.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.480]   She can't wait to tell us about it.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.000]   What is your pick of the week, Stacey?
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.560]   So, you may have seen this, because this is not new,
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:24.000]   but I just encountered it for some reason.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.200]   And it's a site sponsored by the EU called How Normal Am I?
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:30.320]   How normal am I?
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.120]   And you go to the site...
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.960]   ...dot EU.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:33.680]   Should I do it?
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.240]   Shall I do it?
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:34.800]   Shall I do it?
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:35.360]   You can do it!
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.160]   It's sponsored by the government.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:37.760]   So, let's talk about...
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.520]   So, it's an educational thing.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.080]   Specifically, we'll be looking at four AI.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.680]   So, it's...
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:44.720]   You will just get to part of it,
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.960]   but it's going to tell you how attractive you are first.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.320]   And this guy is telling you, it's asking you some questions.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:50.720]   He wants to know, always.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:52.320]   This data, by the way, is not kept.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:53.680]   Okay.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.920]   And...
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:00.320]   None of us read the terms apparently.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.280]   I read the terms.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.320]   I am reading this right now.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.600]   I didn't even see the terms.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:04.080]   Yes.
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:04.640]   Okay.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.640]   So, it's giving you your beauty...
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.840]   I'm a six and a half.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.800]   I'm a six and a half.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.280]   I'm a six and a half.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.400]   That's...
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:11.840]   I'll take it.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.360]   Look, this guy's a seven.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:14.400]   Wait, nine!
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.360]   For example, what the hell...
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.160]   So, if you play it without...
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:20.720]   I got more attractive.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.800]   Yeah, I got more attractive too.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.680]   But I didn't get a seven.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:26.960]   I'm more attractive than 80% of the Spice Girls.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:30.400]   I don't know about that.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.680]   Well, it got up if I smile.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.920]   I don't think so.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:36.080]   If I go down, that was terrifying.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:39.360]   Oh my God, it went up!
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:46.320]   So, if you were listening to the little German dude in the corner,
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:49.120]   instead of us, they would be explaining to you
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:54.480]   how this algorithm is calculated and what types of companies use it.
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.880]   So, I encourage you, when you go check this site out,
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.280]   to actually sit down with the sound of...
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.480]   He talks about that.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.200]   Did you ever end up algorithm?
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.720]   No, no, no.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.480]   He talks about why it was developed,
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:09.200]   which ones they're using, and it talks...
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:15.360]   It's predicting my answers as well.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:20.160]   So, my beauty is ranges from 5.8 to 7.8,
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.840]   although apparently I got a 7.9.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:25.280]   My lowest age prediction is 37.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.320]   Thank you very much.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:30.400]   Mine was 32, so that is pretty wrong.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.520]   Wow, that's good.
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.520]   Did I lie about my age?
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:33.840]   Yes.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.560]   My gender's a man, that's good.
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:36.960]   Go ahead.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.320]   Play the guy's voice.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.960]   Your culture in which an algorithm was constructed
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.960]   can have a big influence on how it will categorize and...
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.080]   What algorithm?
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.000]   It's 99% sure I'm not a woman.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.120]   About at the gay pride.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:48.480]   Whose algorithm?
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.760]   Our next algorithm.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:51.360]   Oh, it's going to tell me about BMI.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.240]   What do you message?
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.120]   Get ready for this.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.880]   Am I from just looking at your face?
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.880]   Just looking at my face, it knows it's going up.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:57.680]   Who could put the algorithm like this?
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.240]   It's going up.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.840]   This is what the EU comes from.
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.120]   Here's what you want, Jeff.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.840]   Here's right here.
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:05.760]   In practice, I found that the required data
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:07.760]   is often simply scraped from the internet.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.280]   For example, some researchers who work at Google
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.200]   took these pictures from online communities
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:14.240]   where people shared their ways.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:16.160]   That's their straw man.
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.000]   I love that this algorithm is perfect.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:18.800]   They're putting up here.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:19.200]   Where are you?
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:22.000]   I'm going to say, Stacey, it's moral panic.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:22.800]   Oh, no!
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:24.160]   An algorithm can do this.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:24.880]   What algorithm?
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.680]   From whom?
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.560]   With what?
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.840]   This is irresponsible as well.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.360]   Listen to it before you think.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.640]   This is the whole thing.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.080]   I have 44 years left to learn about Link on this thing.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:34.800]   Tell me about it.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:35.280]   It's not there.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.040]   It is there.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:37.760]   Okay.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:38.560]   Yeah, keep...
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.240]   Go to the site.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.000]   You read the site because we're not playing all the audio here.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.400]   These types of predictions are essentially created
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.720]   by stacking educated guesses on top of each other,
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:50.800]   which makes the result even more imprecise.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.680]   Dutch.
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.160]   However, that doesn't stop insurance agencies
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.920]   from purchasing these types of predictions.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.800]   So this is an art project by a gentleman named...
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.600]   It thinks my name is Mr. Sexy Pants 80.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.360]   So one guy wrote one algorithm.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.120]   Now this speaks for all algorithms.
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.000]   How awful are you?
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.040]   He's talking about...
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:13.760]   So in this thing, before you have a freaking moral panic attack,
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.960]   listen to the whole thing.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.560]   So he developed...
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:21.040]   I don't remember if he developed this or not,
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.600]   but the idea is to show where these things are used
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:27.200]   and how they are developed.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.600]   And the way they're developed is not wrong.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:32.480]   I've talked to people who build these sorts of things,
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.760]   and the sorts of data he's crunching to get to these algorithms
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.400]   are the same sorts of data they use.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.280]   So the point of this is not...
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.640]   That does a lot of work.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:49.840]   The point of this is to make people aware of two things.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.080]   One, that when you go to these things,
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.200]   a lot of times people are using them to grab your information,
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.160]   which is true.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:58.800]   So if you go to like hot or not or whatever,
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:02.640]   you're going to get...
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:06.160]   They're using that data to feed algorithms.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.920]   One, that's point one he's trying to make.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.520]   Two, is he's talking about how these are used?
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.760]   (laughs)
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.800]   Wait, you already...
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.880]   This isn't now to the dog.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:19.840]   This was to the dog at the beginning.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.040]   Oh, I was happy.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.160]   So I think this is a really good idea,
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.600]   despite what Jeff says,
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.200]   how normally am I that EU?
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.760]   Because it informs you about how these things work.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.120]   I think...
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:34.560]   Yeah, things.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.880]   This is how these things work.
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.240]   It's exactly how these things work.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:38.720]   It's technology.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.800]   This is exactly how these things work.
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:44.400]   But I do want to say there is a flaw in this,
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.640]   which is I am much more interested in what it thinks my age and BMI are,
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.440]   and whether my score looks is seven or eight,
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.160]   that actually makes me much more interested.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:54.800]   (laughs)
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:55.120]   Right?
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.520]   Oh, Jeff, he does...
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:57.600]   What?
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.560]   So what he talks about,
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.360]   the beauty scoring model was found on GitHub,
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.040]   and he points out, too,
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.760]   the models to predict gender age and facial expression
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.600]   are part of face API, JS.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.320]   Who's the first one?
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:08.960]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:10.080]   Jeff, he leads to it.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:11.680]   He's two, I'm gonna get a score.
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.120]   Before my score is revealed,
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.040]   will you allow the anonymous data in the list above
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:16.800]   to be used to calculate a new average?
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.000]   It will shift what this test considers to be normal in your direction.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.040]   I don't even know what that means,
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:22.080]   but I'm gonna say, okay,
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.000]   I am 58% normal.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.880]   I'm averagely normal.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:31.600]   So, I don't know what that all means.
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:34.400]   But again, I'm more distracted by...
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.640]   Oh, I think some pretty good looking.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:38.480]   (laughs)
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:39.040]   Honestly...
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.920]   There you go.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:41.360]   I'm missing the whole point of this,
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.120]   you know, the whole thing,
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:43.680]   because I'm going,
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:45.520]   "Wow, they'd only think some 37."
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:48.160]   It thinks my BMI is 22.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.840]   What the hell?
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:52.160]   I like this machine.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.520]   (laughs)
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.320]   It thinks I'm gonna live another 80 years.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.160]   I love this machine.
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:00.160]   So I'm missing the whole point,
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:00.960]   in other words, right?
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.640]   Yeah, and Jeff,
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.080]   if you go into...
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:05.840]   He puts his sources in there,
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.520]   so you can meet up and get your...
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.000]   It's just an art project.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:08.880]   Yeah, it's...
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:11.440]   But I think it's really good for explaining...
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.320]   I agree.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.440]   What this stuff is,
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.720]   and how it's being used.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.760]   And even...
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.000]   Like, I mean, we just saw the tweets from Lemonade
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.920]   talking about how they're gonna sesh fraud
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.280]   on your insurance claim,
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.280]   based on your video claims data.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.880]   They're gonna run it through an AI.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.720]   And he does, at the bottom,
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:29.680]   Jeff have a whole link of sources and references.
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:30.800]   Yeah, my point is,
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.000]   he sets up a straw man.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.800]   I'm saying, this is what all of it does.
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.080]   Jeff, you're setting up a straw man,
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:38.880]   'cause you didn't listen to the whole thing, period.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.920]   Stacey is snapping at you right now.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:42.720]   Facts.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.280]   Facts.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.800]   Be the full article man.
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.480]   No, waffles for me.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.760]   By the way, the beauty judgment
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:52.400]   comes from how TikTok works.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.760]   So, okay.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.720]   Okay.
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:56.240]   I'm just saying,
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:57.680]   I'm according to TikTok,
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:58.880]   I'm good looking.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.160]   Well, I can't confirm,
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:02.400]   TikTok does this algorithmically, comma.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.560]   No, it doesn't.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:07.120]   Well, they've said that they do.
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:09.600]   They've been on the record about the practice.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.880]   But it's not, no.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.000]   Let's move on.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:12.800]   Let's just move on.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:13.040]   All right.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:16.720]   Move on, 'cause I'm gonna get sn cochier with Jeff.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:18.640]   It tells you, it watches the whole thing.
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:20.320]   I like it.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:22.720]   And it's an art project.
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:24.640]   Is it a smart man from playing about technology?
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.240]   Yes, because he's no one.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.040]   He's for you.
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:30.240]   This is an educational thing for people to understand.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.360]   Should we don't have a specific--
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:34.080]   How algorithmic decisions are made about you.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.120]   I think he should check in.
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.680]   He's labeling all his--
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:39.600]   Besides, it thinks I'm 37.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:44.000]   I only did that to seduce you, Leo,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.360]   so that you'd buy things from it.
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:47.280]   No, it's not selling anything.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:48.560]   All right, Jeff, what's your number?
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.480]   Smudgey camera.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:54.160]   And it stays so you can say anything you want about Jeff's number.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:57.200]   Line 120.
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.800]   This will fit right in actually now.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.760]   Line 120.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.320]   120.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.360]   America talks.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:02.800]   They're now coming up called America Talks,
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:04.880]   which is based on something that Dietseit did.
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.520]   A couple of years ago called Düchlänstprikt,
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.360]   which man's Germany speaks,
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:13.200]   where you answer five binary questions.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:18.400]   And then the algorithm will pair you with someone,
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:21.280]   if it weren't for the pandemic,
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.560]   it would be someone near you.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:25.520]   But now it'll be on Zoom with whom you disagree.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.560]   Oh god, the last thing in the world I want to do is talk to somebody.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.400]   That was my question.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.400]   I'll just call up my family.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:36.080]   I can talk to people I disagree with without leaving the house.
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.680]   I don't need to do this.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.160]   So if you go to sign up,
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.480]   it will then ask you five questions.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.240]   You can demonstrate that.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:46.480]   Do you approve of the job Joe Biden is doing?
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.200]   Yes.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.600]   It's kind of a binary choice, but okay.
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.240]   It's all binary.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:53.120]   Should the laws covering the sale of guns be more strict?
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:53.840]   No.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:56.400]   Is freedom of religion an attack today in America?
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:56.960]   No.
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.120]   Is a 15 minimum wage good?
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:07:59.840]   Yes.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.400]   Is legalizing recreational marijuana a good idea?
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.520]   Absolutely not.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.800]   Is a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants a good idea?
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:07.360]   Yes.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.680]   Is three speech threatened on college campuses?
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:09.920]   No.
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:10.160]   Okay.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.360]   I've answered the questions.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.280]   I missed one.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:13.840]   Oh yeah.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.160]   Yeah.
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:18.160]   No, I don't believe freedom of religion is under attack today.
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.920]   Thanks for your responses.
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.800]   What are your hopes for America in the coming year?
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.360]   So the thing is-
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:24.240]   How are they June 12?
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:26.720]   I don't want to talk to somebody who disagrees with me.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.480]   Really?
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.040]   Do you?
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:30.560]   Well you do it here every week.
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:30.880]   I know.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.080]   I don't have much choice.
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.120]   I'm talking to Jeff right now.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:37.760]   Yeah, I guess we get our film this.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:38.720]   No.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.880]   You don't want to talk to someone who disagrees with you
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:43.200]   because it's an impossible conversation.
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:44.960]   What are you saying?
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:45.920]   Because I think that's the-
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:46.320]   That's the-
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.480]   Well, it depends who they pick.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:52.480]   But if they pick somebody who thinks black people are inferior,
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.080]   Donald Trump won the election,
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.400]   I don't want to have nothing to say to somebody like that.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:56.800]   Right.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:58.080]   And what'd you do?
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:00.960]   I'm going to Texas in two weeks.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:01.520]   Would you do this?
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.480]   No, I don't buy other stuff like this.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:04.640]   No.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.760]   Stacy, would you do this?
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:07.440]   No.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:09.680]   I already do this with my family and it's no something.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.760]   I've praised this from Germany and then when it actually came time to do it, I said,
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:14.880]   "No."
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.360]   Yeah.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:15.600]   No.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.400]   So this is the-
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:16.880]   No.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:16.880]   This-
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.560]   Some would say this is the problem is that we are not talking to one another.
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:21.280]   And-
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.040]   But sometimes for good reason.
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:26.640]   I think there are people who feel to like,
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.600]   "I'm not going to talk to that atheist liberal from California."
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.520]   I don't want to hear from him.
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:35.040]   Maybe you'd meet someone very nice and find out that they're actually okay.
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.000]   I'm sure they're nice.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.240]   As long as we don't talk about any of those issues.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:38.720]   I'm so-
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:38.880]   I'm so-
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:38.880]   I'm so-
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.760]   I'm so-
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:39.840]   I'm so-
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:40.400]   I'm-
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:40.880]   I talked to people-
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.360]   I talked to people about them-
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:41.680]   I'm so crazy.
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:42.080]   I'm so crazy-
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:42.720]   I've talked to people about them and they keep-
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:43.120]   I talk to people about them and they keep-
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:43.120]   I talk to people about them and they keep-

[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.640]   Yes, it's £1 for a 5 minute argument.
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:25.040]   I shouldn't play the whole thing because YouTube-
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.720]   I do? We will get picked on.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.240]   It-
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:29.760]   But it doesn't just say no it doesn't.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:30.720]   Yes it is? No it isn't!
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:32.640]   [laughter]
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.040]   Arguments and intellectual process, contradiction is just the
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.600]   automatic game saying of anything the other person says.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.400]   No it isn't.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.600]   Yes it is! Not at all.
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.240]   No, no!
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:40.720]   [bell dings]
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:41.360]   Thank you.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.160]   [laughter]
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:47.680]   Alright, that was very good and I think that's exactly what happened with me.
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.520]   I went and talked to somebody.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.040]   So today I was in a faculty meeting where things got a little heated?
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.720]   Well no, um, um-
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:57.760]   Spicy?
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.320]   Difficult.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.760]   Difficult conversation time, right?
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:00.320]   Okay.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:04.240]   And so, people I have said something to say, somebody else had a somebody say,
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.560]   is one faculty member said, really brilliant. And this is what I have to say, I'm tired of having this conversation.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.800]   And the person who started the Zoom accidentally at that moment killed the entire Zoom.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:16.880]   Oh!
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.400]   Are you sure it was accidental?
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:21.120]   Well she is the one who talked to another power.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.600]   It was a mic drop.
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:24.800]   It was a perfect Zoom drop.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.000]   [squeals]
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.640]   That was great.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.520]   Oh that's fun.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.360]   There we have it.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.280]   Your number of the week-
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.400]   or no, it wasn't a number of your site of the week was-
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:34.800]   Well I'm the one.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.440]   Let's say it again.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.200]   americatalks.us
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:42.880]   In case you're one of the handful people actually wants to start a Zoom.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.440]   I think I'm so glad that's the case.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.040]   Who disagrees with them.
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:46.320]   And what's your pick of the week?
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.960]   Oh, let's see.
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:55.520]   Mine was something fun and it's something I saw on Twitter and I got 11 out of it.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.480]   And you know I almost showed this the other day because of your tweet and then I'm glad you
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:01.680]   glad you brought this back up.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:02.160]   You got it.
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:02.720]   What did you get?
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:04.160]   I got 11.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.200]   11?
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:06.640]   It only goes to 10.
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.680]   What?
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:10.720]   But this is testing your lungs.
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:13.600]   Basically this tweet has this little revolving-
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.520]   No, no, no.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.520]   Okay, I just want to say if you're watching this show-
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.520]   Because there's no audio so-
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:21.120]   But if you're watching this, please don't do this.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:22.240]   I don't want you to pass out.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.000]   I don't think that can be dangerous.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.440]   You won't pass out.
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.640]   What do you mean you won't pass out?
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.840]   Hopefully you decide to excel if you can't hold your breath a little longer.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.040]   You exhaled before you.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.000]   I mean like I probably could have gone to 10 but I might have passed out.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.920]   Did you really get 11 and 10?
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:36.960]   You guys, are you-
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:37.920]   No, I got nine.
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:38.320]   Are you D-
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:38.880]   I got 11.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   D-
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   I got 11.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   D-
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   I got 11.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   D-
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:38.880]   I got 11.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.880]   D-
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:42.720]   competitive breath holding or what's going on.
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.040]   I'm pretty good at slowing down.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:45.680]   If I were playing against Ant.
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:49.040]   Oh, I'm pretty good at slowing down.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:49.680]   Is this just-
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:52.400]   Oh, is that what you do is you just let your body go and lose your body?
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.360]   You just got to slow down.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:53.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:55.440]   I'm not going to do this.
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:58.640]   But I wanted to challenge y'all on that and see what you got.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:01.600]   But that was my one pick and my other pick was-
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.440]   This by the way, it does come from a hospital.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:05.920]   So I'm going to presume it's somewhat accurate.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:09.600]   Although I'm not a fan of these kinds of tests because honestly,
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.120]   I think people could hurt themselves.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:11.520]   Go ahead.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:14.720]   Yeah, there are some people that are doing that.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:16.160]   I think people could hurt themselves.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:16.640]   Don't hate yourself.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:17.600]   Exhaled if you need to-
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:20.080]   Chate room, chate room, breathe please, breathe.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:20.400]   Okay.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:21.120]   Please, please.
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:22.160]   Don't stop breathing.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.640]   I am also-
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:26.720]   I was recently on a-
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.920]   another show called Behind the Shot where I was able to share-
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:31.920]   one of my favorite shots-
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:36.480]   so actually my favorite shot that I captured in Shanghai, China a couple years ago.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.400]   And it's a long exposure.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.760]   I call it the Blue Ghost.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:47.120]   And yeah, it was a lot of fun talking about how I was able to capture that and put it together and just-
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:50.080]   Yeah, nerd out a little bit about photography.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:52.320]   So it's behind the shot.tv.
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:56.480]   Hosted by Mr. Steve Brazel on this episode.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:56.800]   Nice.
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:02.000]   And before we go, this is May.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.200]   The month is almost over.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.280]   This is Mental Health Awareness Month.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:08.320]   I want everybody to remember that.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.720]   Don't forget that and take time to-
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.600]   if you need to take a break and have a vacation or staycation, do it.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.960]   Take care of yourself.
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:18.800]   Get your mental health in order and-
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.240]   Thank you for always bringing that up.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:22.720]   A lot healthier, if you will.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.080]   I bet you that it's now been a year since you've been with us because I remember you talking about this last May.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:29.840]   Have you been with us here?
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:33.280]   Well, no, it'll be two years in July, sir.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.800]   Are you kidding me?
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.080]   [Laughter]
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:36.480]   It'll be two-
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.920]   I thought you were the new guy.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.800]   Because we haven't been in the studio for a year, so yeah.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:42.560]   I thought you were the new guy.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.000]   Wow, it's almost two years.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.040]   It'll be two years in July.
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:50.720]   We were just talking about that here in the house because, you know, this is milestone time and-
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:57.200]   It was a big move for you guys to leave North Carolina and family and friends and come all the way out here
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.280]   on a fairly speculative job at Twit.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.880]   I'm eternally grateful to you for doing it.
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.880]   You've been such an addition to the show.
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.640]   I can't believe it's been almost two years.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:09.280]   That's incredible.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.280]   And there you go.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.400]   This week, this week, as of Friday coming up,
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:15.200]   Oh.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.280]   Senior hard hit will be a graduate.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:20.400]   I am pretty pumped up on it and can't.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:20.960]   That's great.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.560]   He'll be shipping off for school here soon.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.480]   Still waiting on a way to get more money to pay for school.
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.000]   But yeah, I'm pretty proud.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.680]   That's a big milestone.
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:34.880]   Tell me the truth now.
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.960]   I know this was difficult, a very challenging move.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:40.160]   I know for Queen Pruitt.
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:42.400]   The boys are just pretty well.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.760]   Are they happy they're out here now?
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.360]   Oh, look.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:47.440]   I'm dead serious about this.
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:52.480]   Before we even got to California, they already had friends here.
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.080]   Wow.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:58.000]   We were in Arizona somewhere and they were on Snapchat
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.440]   and talking to other people.
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:00.080]   See?
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.480]   At the schools that they were going to attend.
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:02.720]   Yeah.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:06.400]   And they were already popular before we even got here.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:10.560]   And when school started for them, they were just no big deal.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:12.960]   And they're just so living it out of that.
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:15.280]   I was a little worried.
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:18.320]   It's hard for kids, especially high school students,
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.720]   to leave everybody behind and go to a new place,
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:21.920]   a strange place,
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.760]   place very different for where they grew up.
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:26.640]   So I'm very happy to hear that they did well in there.
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:27.360]   They're happy here.
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:32.000]   There were high schools in three states and four elementary schools in three states.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.200]   Was your dad in service?
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:33.920]   Why did you move over?
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:35.120]   No, he got out so he wouldn't move.
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.320]   But in that time in America, back in the '20s, as you've been saying,
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:42.160]   you were in sales management.
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:43.600]   They moved you around.
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.560]   Yeah.
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.040]   It also explains a lot about how weird I am.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.480]   It sure does.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.800]   But me and the new kid can have some advantages, right?
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.320]   Because you get it when you get a fresh start.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:55.200]   Get to start over.
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:55.520]   Yeah.
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.000]   Well, I...
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:56.480]   I mean...
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.120]   I thought this was the right time.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:01.600]   I had to consider it,
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.840]   but I thought it was the right time because at the time,
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.080]   the senior was a rise in junior.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:09.040]   And I felt like, okay, that's enough time for him to get a speed read.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.440]   And it's better to have a couple of years instead of just one.
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:12.400]   Right.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.600]   And then the...
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.240]   now, freshman, he was getting ready to go into the eighth grade.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.760]   Oh, so he was going to be able to...
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.240]   Yeah.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:20.800]   Right.
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:21.840]   So it had been...
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:22.240]   It had been...
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.120]   How's yours, though?
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.880]   How's yours doing with me?
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:25.440]   Oh, she's fine.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:27.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:29.440]   She moved from Austin to the Seattle area.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:30.480]   Did she...
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:32.400]   Yeah, she was a rising eighth grader like Ants could.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:33.600]   Yeah, that's a good time to do it.
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.320]   Yeah.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.920]   She would disagree.
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:36.800]   But yes, it was.
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:38.480]   Well, wait, wait, wait.
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:40.960]   So she would say, oh, no, you ruined my life or...
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.440]   She was really devastated.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:44.880]   I mean, she had gone to the school...
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.440]   The same school for Kinder through...
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.280]   It would have ended in eighth grade,
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.120]   but she had gone to that school since Kindergarten.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.400]   That is a big disruption.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:52.880]   Oh, okay.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:59.440]   I moved to California from Providence when I was a sophomore
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.080]   in high school.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.640]   And I was very unhappy about the prospect of the move.
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.480]   But once I was going to a boys' school,
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:10.400]   and as soon as I got to Santa Cruz High,
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.720]   I realized there were certain benefits.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:17.840]   And I quickly got...
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.840]   Yeah, in California in the '70s,
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.680]   I quickly got over my...
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.760]   I never went back.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:26.480]   Actually, I still love California, so...
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.600]   It can be challenging, but I'm glad...
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.000]   You know, this has been a very horrible year for kids.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.680]   They've done unbelievably well,
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.080]   and I'm quite proud of both of them.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.840]   I'm quite proud of the Queen Pruitt,
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.440]   because again, like you said, it was hard,
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:43.760]   because she's leaving her family behind,
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.280]   just like I left my family behind,
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:49.200]   and she has a much tighter bond with her family than I did.
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:50.800]   So I knew it was going to be difficult,
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.680]   but she's been able to just put her head down
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:55.440]   and keep herself occupied,
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:57.280]   and find things of interest,
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:00.160]   and entertain, and learn, and grow.
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.280]   And it's just...
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.520]   It's been quite fascinating to watch.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:06.640]   I keep pushing out that film that I shot,
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:08.160]   because it means a lot,
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.960]   because I saw the growth in her,
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:12.480]   and she saw the growth in her,
[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:13.760]   and when I presented it to her,
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.200]   I was like, "We should share this.
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:16.400]   We should put this out here,"
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.800]   because you just lived this mess.
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:21.760]   2020 was a mess for a lot of people,
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:26.320]   and people that have mental health problems,
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.880]   it's really, really, really hard,
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:31.440]   but she buckled down, as you say,
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:33.280]   and fought through it,
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:34.800]   and just really grew up,
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:37.680]   and got some stuff going for her right now,
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.080]   that she's quite proud of with the...
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:41.120]   I love the pods.
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:42.080]   Yeah, I love my head.
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:42.880]   My head.
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.080]   My head.
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:44.240]   Yeah.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:47.120]   What's her Etsy store?
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.080]   Where can we...
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.760]   She's taking it off.
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:53.040]   Oh, and I end up putting it right on her own website.
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:54.960]   I can't say that.
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.000]   Not too bad she doesn't know
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.760]   somebody who could help her set that up.
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:00.320]   Yeah, we're going to do that.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:00.880]   I am.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:01.360]   I am.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:01.840]   I am.
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.800]   We're going to do that.
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:05.440]   She's going to the pharmace market,
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:06.560]   and doing quite well.
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:09.600]   Please let us know when she's got those for sale,
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:10.480]   because I mean,
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:11.520]   they're people around here bottom.
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:12.240]   They're great.
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:12.800]   Yeah.
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:13.360]   Yeah.
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:13.760]   Yeah.
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.680]   You know, you raised another really important point here,
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.160]   which is part of what I guess I was trying to say about.
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:19.760]   I think you don't do the internet.
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:20.160]   Is that...
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:23.600]   We all have a lot to be proud of
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:24.720]   for having gotten through this year.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.240]   And it was tough,
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.440]   and it was difficult,
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:34.640]   and a lot of people had worse times than me.
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:35.840]   I'm very privileged.
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:37.440]   I have a job, but...
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:37.680]   Right.
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:38.640]   That's what I say.
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.760]   But people survived,
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:42.640]   and they got through it,
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:43.600]   and they struggled through it,
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:44.960]   and I think everybody who has
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:46.080]   should be proud of themselves
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.760]   for what they've accomplished in this last year,
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:48.800]   because good lord,
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:49.360]   it's been on Windows.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:49.840]   No doubt.
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:51.760]   No doubt.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:52.000]   Yeah.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.160]   Well, Ant,
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:56.320]   thank you so much for being a part of our family.
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:57.280]   We love your family.
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:58.160]   Thank you for having me.
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:58.640]   Thank you for having me.
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.040]   Thank you for having me.
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:02.320]   Find Ant at twitter.tv/handsonphotography.
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:03.120]   H-O-P.
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:04.160]   Yes.
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.360]   Every Wednesday,
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.040]   right here on This Week in Google.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.760]   @ant_pruit on the Twitter,
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:11.120]   and of course there's YouTube,
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.400]   and there's a lot of other things.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:13.360]   If you search for Ant Pruit,
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.840]   you find many, many adventures,
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.520]   including NFT.
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:19.280]   Have you sold that yet?
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:22.960]   Yeah, actually somebody very close to us
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:24.480]   bought that first NFT,
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.920]   but I put two more out there.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:26.320]   Nice.
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:28.160]   Pruit.com/NFT.
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:28.720]   Nice.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.560]   This is what I spent doing on my vacation
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.720]   is coming up with some more art.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.040]   And Pruit.com/NFT.
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.760]   And Pruit.com has a lot of beautiful pictures too
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:38.960]   as a wonderful photographer.
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:39.600]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.560]   Thank you.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.280]   You appreciate it.
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:42.480]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:43.440]   Thank you.
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:46.320]   You know what I want for Christmas?
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:48.960]   I want to do the blob opera version.
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.080]   I'm singing Craig's name.
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:52.160]   I think we're going to get that software.
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:53.520]   How can we do that?
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:54.000]   Can we make it?
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.600]   Mr. How is the musician?
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.520]   He has a way to make that happen, I'm sure.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:58.720]   We could do that, yeah.
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:22:59.840]   That would be really...
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.600]   That's actually interesting.
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:04.880]   So they improved the blob opera, they said, right?
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:05.680]   So that we can do...
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:07.200]   Can we do like...
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.880]   Can we tell it what to play?
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:09.360]   I don't know.
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:10.160]   We should try that.
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:12.240]   Let's see here.
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.360]   Let's...
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:14.240]   Why don't we...
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:14.960]   What do you guys see?
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.400]   She thought she was so close to a waffle.
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:17.440]   Okay.
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:18.000]   I know.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.600]   How about a whole man?
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:20.160]   You ready?
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:21.120]   Here we go.
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:23.280]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.280]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the...
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:32.000]   Greg.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.440]   Greg.
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:37.040]   New art.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:38.000]   Graduate school journals.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.240]   That works pretty well.
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:40.800]   It needs work.
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:41.120]   Yes.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:41.440]   Needs work.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.160]   Uh oh.
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:44.880]   He's coming back.
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:46.880]   Let's see it rehearsal next week.
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:53.920]   Stacey Higginbotham@staceyoniot.com
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:55.680]   You should subscribe to our free newsletter.
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.560]   There's events there.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:58.000]   There's great journalism.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:58.800]   And of course,
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:01.360]   the IOT podcast she does with Kevin Tofol.
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:03.520]   We appreciate that.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.640]   And this week's newsletter is going to have the thing
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:08.400]   she wouldn't tell us from Kevin.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:09.920]   Which means next week,
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:11.680]   and now that it's old news, she'll tell us.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:12.640]   Yeah.
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.480]   So, uh, look forward to that.
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:16.080]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:16.640]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:17.280]   Thank you, Aunt.
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:20.000]   We do this show this week in Google,
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.560]   which is, as you can see for a little about Google,
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:23.360]   but a lot of stuff.
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:27.600]   Every Wednesday, about 11, no, I'm sorry, 2pm,

[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:37.120]   If you're doing that,
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.440]   you really should also join us in the chat room.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.160]   Of course, club twit members can listen live in our Discord.

[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.680]   even sometimes ask questions and participate.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.120]   That's always a lot of fun.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.320]   If you're not a club twit member,

[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.880]   we'd sure appreciate a five-star review.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.120]   Let other people know why you listen to this week in Google.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:20.480]   And if you subscribe, then you'll get it automatically.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.240]   I have a Wednesday evening after the editors turn it into something better
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:26.560]   than what it was.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.320]   One hopes.
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.960]   Anyway, thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:33.600]   We'll see you next time this week in Google.
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:34.080]   Bye-bye.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:42.400]   You know what's fun, Android.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.920]   You know what's even more fun though?
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:44.880]   All about Android.
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.440]   That's my show, Jason Howell, along with my co-host,
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.200]   Ron Richards, Florence Ion.
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:54.240]   And we welcome guests on each and every week from throughout the Android ecosystem,
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.480]   developers, Googlers, journalists, people who are all geeked out
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:00.320]   about the Android operating system.
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:05.040]   We tell you everything you need to know, twit.tv/AA every Tuesday.
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:06.080]   We'll see you there.
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:16.560]   [Music]
