[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160]   And I got to say this right up front, because people always get mad.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.960]   They say, well, it wasn't all about Google.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.360]   No, it's not all about Google.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.840]   It's about everything and anything that Jeff Jarvis and Gina
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.440]   Tupany want to talk about.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.480]   And it's particularly Google, the cloud, that kind of thing.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.320]   Gina Tupany is here, founding editor of SmarterWare.--
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.440]   She's always been the founder and editor of SmarterWare.org,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.120]   but also Life Hacker.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.440]   And the author of Think Up.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.640]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.360]   Hi.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.160]   Good to be here.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.040]   We have decided a new feature for Gina.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   She's going to do the Italian recipe of the week.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That works.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   There we go.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.520]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachined.com
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.680]   and the author of Public Parts and What Would Google Do.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.040]   Hey.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.160]   And joining us, and we always welcome him,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.240]   Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   And you now have a whole bunch of lands.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.160]   He's land-rich.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.480]   That's one of the land-marketing land, too.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.040]   Marketing land.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   Good to have you, Danny.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.920]   That's an Atlanta.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.760]   Thanks to having back.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.360]   One of the most astute observers of the Google sphere
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.520]   and this space in general.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.120]   So, Golly, where to begin?
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.960]   There's so much to talk about this week.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   The president is doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.120]   I think that's awesome.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.440]   I just had to say that.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.080]   Go to Reddit.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   It's reddit.com/r/iama.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.520]   And right at the top there, you should see President Obama's
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.640]   ask me anything.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   OK.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.000]   Just have to get that out there.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.840]   We can move on.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   Get to before the birth certificate.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.960]   Oh, that's so silly.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.040]   I love this because it's--
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.200]   you have to-- when you do an Ask Me Anything,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.160]   you have to say, I am and ask me anything.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   And he says, I am Barack Obama president
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.600]   of the United States, AMA.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.200]   I love it.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.000]   He actually doesn't start till 130 Pacific,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   430 Eastern time.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.880]   And then he says, proof it's me.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.480]   And he quotes his Twitter.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.840]   Isn't that funny?
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.680]   That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.160]   And then he says, yes, I'll be taking your questions online.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.360]   So that is crucial.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.720]   And that's a verified account.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   So we know it is the president.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.080]   Who likes to make that happen?
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.520]   I wonder.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   Who is his team--
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm sure there's a team working with him.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.280]   They're very, very savvy.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.040]   Oh, there he is, typing on a Mac,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.320]   although they've obscured the Apple.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.080]   Look what they did there, except they made a mistake.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.560]   He's got a magic mouse.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   Look at that.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.400]   What did they do to the Apple?
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.560]   Can you zoom in on whatever that thing is?
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.160]   Is it an Obama logo?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   It actually looks like it's just a-- oh, yeah, that's it.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's it.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.320]   Not fooling anyone.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   Yeah, it looks like that's a comic book.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.680]   I think I'll make sure the president.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.240]   Oh, and look what happened to Reddit.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.840]   As soon as we said that, Reddit is under heavy load right now.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.560]   Sorry.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.200]   All right, now as long as you've got my screen up,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.560]   keep it up because I want to go to google.com.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920]   And note that things have changed a little bit
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   on the formerly clean, simple Google homepage.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   I'm counting, let's see, an ad for the Nexus 7 right there,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.560]   the bound stop.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.840]   Another ad here for Discover a Faster Way
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.440]   to browse the web, install Google Chrome.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.960]   And now it's telling me somebody's birthday.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.760]   That's the part.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   That's quite cool.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.000]   The birthday crap is going to--
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.920]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.040]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.520]   Where's Marissa Meyer when we need her?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   I'm just saying Marissa Meyer is drowning
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.560]   in her new dog office.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.960]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.360]   So this is coming from Google+.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.200]   These are these birthdays are people.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.320]   I don't actually know who this is that I'm supposed
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.840]   to say happy birthday to.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.040]   Don Draper, it looks like.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.440]   Don't you?
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.960]   Come on.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.480]   I'm not as a Google executor.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   Very strange.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.360]   Well, I think what you're seeing, though,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.040]   is the coming Yahoo--
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.360]   Yahooization of Google.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.440]   Oh, God.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840]   Don't say that.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.440]   Oh, but it will.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.680]   This is my prediction.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.720]   So Yahoo makes a ton of money off of their homepage.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.220]   Right.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.720]   The huge one.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.240]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   So many people go to it.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.720]   Right.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.600]   I mean, Google has traditionally-- I mean, what was it?
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.560]   They said millions of dollars a day that they're foregoing.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Right.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.680]   And I think that's going to stop happening.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.880]   Now, the ad that you see for the Nexus 7,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.280]   we've had ads like that kind of thing, maybe not
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.880]   with the little pop-up, but they have over time
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.840]   them little lines underneath it like that.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.960]   So it's not even like you can write the headline like,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.720]   for the first time, Google doesn't add on.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   I mean, they--
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.600]   But the pop-up is a little more--
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.760]   I know the pop-up, though.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.680]   But here's the key thing.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   Actually, the more significant thing
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.320]   is what's going to happen with the birthdays.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.280]   I think what's going to happen is, in a year from now,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600]   you're going to log into Google+,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.320]   because we all have accounts at that point.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   And Google's going to show you a different home page.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.320]   You're going to go to Google to do a search, the Google Home
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   page.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.520]   And they're going to say that, hey, because you're on Google+,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.800]   we've now put the best of Google+, into the Google Home page.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   And you'll get things like not just a little birthday
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.560]   notification, but maybe what's hot on Google+,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.160]   and slowly and gradually.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.560]   But what will happen is, the Google Home page
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.600]   will turn into being this portal page.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.280]   They'll be able to have ads out there.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.200]   They'll be able to promote Google+, out there.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.560]   But they'll say that they're only doing it for people
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.760]   with Google+ account, so that the classic Google Home page
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.160]   will remain the way it is.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.880]   And they can still kind of say, well, no, it's still all clean.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.680]   It's still all new.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's not not anything different.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.640]   But yet, they'll tap into this huge amount of inventory
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.400]   that they pretty much haven't been able to use.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   Why?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.560]   Didn't they just kill that?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.640]   With what's my call?
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.680]   What was the homepage that they killed?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   I Googled.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.440]   Exactly.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.920]   Exactly.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.280]   They killed I Google, right?
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.680]   Good way to get rid of it.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.160]   Because nobody really kind of used it.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.960]   You never necessarily got forced into it.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.360]   It wasn't really growing.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.560]   But this will be what will come down the line.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.280]   This will be the iGoogleization of the Google Home page,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.720]   or the Google+ification of the Google Home page.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.280]   That's really the better thing that's going to happen,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   is that I think you're going to see Google+ start to move out
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.760]   and take over that homepage, so that when you go to Google.com
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.720]   and you are logged in, it's not just
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   going to be a search box.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.160]   It's going to be, here's what's hot on Google+.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.640]   And that'll be another way of them to help promote the Google+
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.600]   social network, too.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   So what happened?
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.480]   Because Google has chewed this for so long,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.680]   and turned down millions and millions of dollars.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.200]   What happened to Google that they changed their tune?
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.400]   Want to make more money?
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.680]   Yeah, but they could have made more money any time
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   in the last eight years.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   Why all of a sudden--
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.040]   It's not even for them to do it.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.400]   Now it's like, who are they having to compete against
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.760]   to be a portal like that?
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   AOL?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.200]   Yahoo?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.080]   I mean, now that they've--
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.360]   they haven't necessarily done it,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   but now that you've had a lot of these things sort of go away
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.920]   and you're looking at the landscape, what are they competing
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.120]   with?
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.920]   They're competing with people who are going into things
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.440]   like Facebook and starting their day at a Facebook
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.360]   by seeing everything that's showing up.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.400]   All right, well, that's what Google+ is in part
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.320]   supposed to do for them.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.800]   But if you're trying to entice more people into it,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.040]   who aren't necessarily going there,
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.080]   you start leveraging your homepage.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   I think what happens in their minds
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   is that they look at these different things very individually.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.320]   That they'll say, well, we're putting this stuff out
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.600]   on the Google Home page because it's
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.040]   in the benefit of the user and we're showing more stuff for them
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.720]   and that's going to help with discovery
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.640]   and that's going to help with all sorts of stuff.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.280]   And they don't tend to look back on it like, wait a minute.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.240]   Didn't we say we were never going to do this
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.080]   and there were reasons why we were never going to do this?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.440]   And to be fair, sometimes reasons do change.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.000]   But that's why I think you see this sort of thing happening.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.320]   And then the chatroom's saying reasonably, well, who cares?
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.080]   Because nobody uses the Google Home page.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   We all use the browser search.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.000]   Yeah, I was just going to say, the entry point of Google Search
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   isn't-- I think that the homepage is on decline,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.240]   not because they're adding crap to it,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.400]   but because people don't use it as much.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.920]   I mean, there are so many other entry points in a Google search.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   And if you look at what Google's doing with Google now,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.200]   that's them trying to anticipate what is relevant to you right now.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.720]   What do you want to know?
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.600]   So you want to know if you're one of your friend's birthdays.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   I also agree that that's just not something I want on my Google.com
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.560]   But you can control it in the Google now,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.800]   and you can say, I don't want to see that card again.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.200]   I actually love Google now.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.560]   I don't know why that's different from my mind
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.680]   than the Google Home page being.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   That's a really good point.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.880]   Well, Google now is a totally new product.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   And you expect that it's trying to anticipate
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.160]   what you're going to ask for.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.840]   I think that's kind of-- I mean, these things
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.000]   are all sort of merging into Google's-- just like Jeff's
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.440]   talked about for 160 episodes, they want to divine your intent,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.040]   and they want to use all the signals they can.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.840]   And so now they have this whole social graph
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.320]   through Google+, so they want to show you stuff
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.480]   that they think you're going to want to know.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.520]   And of course, well, the Nexus 7 advertisement
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.560]   is just them trying to tweak sales.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.040]   They want to sell it while they can,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.600]   before Amazon comes out with this new Kindle and Apple comes out
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.040]   with its iPad Mini.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   Exactly.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   One is that Google has still not sold its home page.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.240]   That would be a huge Rubicon to pass.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.280]   That's a good point.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.240]   This is all Google stuff.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   It's Google stuff.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.160]   And they're probably--
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.760]   They get rapping.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.560]   They're already there.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.080]   It's great.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   Second place.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.160]   Do you just have an earthquake, Danny?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   I have an earthquake.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.120]   Where are you located?
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.600]   Newport Beach.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.640]   That was definitely a quake.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.880]   You felt it pretty strongly?
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.720]   Yeah, you guys gone.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.880]   We're having swarms down here.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.120]   Gita, you should feel it.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.640]   Yeah, I know.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.160]   I'm looking at my hanging plant.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.800]   It hasn't moved.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'm not feeling it here.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.960]   I'm checking my sphincting out.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.360]   Because you had some strong ones the other day.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   Well, maybe my imagination.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.040]   Anyway, go ahead.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.560]   No.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   Let's look at the real-time earthquake map.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.120]   And just--
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.760]   I was thinking in the Earth moved for me.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   I don't know.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.640]   The Earth moved.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.120]   Donda, his feet.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.920]   The real-time earthquake map is not
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.440]   showing anything right now.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.640]   I'll take a look at it.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   There was a big cluster in your area.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   Well, they've been having a lot out in Brawley.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.760]   Brawley, that's where it is.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.040]   Here we are, 2057.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.440]   Now that's too later.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   Anyway, I'll hang in there.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.240]   It might have been just my imagination.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.640]   Isn't it funny if you start having earthquakes?
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.280]   And people are wondering what we're talking about.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.360]   But if you start having earthquakes in your area,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.080]   you feel them then all the time.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.440]   Phantom earthquake.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.480]   It's like a phantom phone buzz, yes.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   I feel-- now, can we just talk about the phantom phone
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.640]   buzz?
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.520]   Because I thought I was the only one afflicted by that.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.640]   Oh, I get it all the time.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.680]   And now I hear that this is actually a thing.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.520]   Yes.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.680]   So I feel like I have my phone in my pocket,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.960]   and I feel like it's buzzing.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.520]   When I don't have it in my pocket, that's
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.560]   where I know I'm nutty.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.320]   I feel a buzz.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.000]   OK, well then we know it's not real.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.080]   You people are crazy.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.880]   You've never felt that?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.480]   I don't-- I have an aversion to voice calls, so--
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.040]   No, it's not.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.720]   It's just a buzz.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.280]   It could be anything.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.720]   It's a buzz.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   So like a notification.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.680]   OK, OK, yeah.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.760]   Yeah, I kind of have an aversion to those two.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.960]   But yeah, I'm not.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.120]   Others in our chat room say they are
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.520]   feeling the phantom vibration.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   And Chad, you feel it too.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.320]   All the time.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.760]   Isn't this funny?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   We are all subject to this.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.200]   And nobody really knew it until somebody said it.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.040]   And then now we go, oh, yeah, I got that.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.400]   Well, I mean, I got that.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.920]   Yeah, we talked about that way.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.800]   Oh, we have.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.520]   Well, I mean, me and my friends--
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.520]   I remember before I moved out.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   There we go.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.040]   There we go.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   It is in here, Belinda.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   All right.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.120]   Oh, yeah, here it is.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.320]   Five kilometers south of Brawley.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   Boy, there's a big cluster.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.280]   Yeah, four ones, you'd feel that.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.320]   So that's not a phantom buzz.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.280]   It's the real deal.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.640]   I thought I was getting earthquakes all the time.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.520]   And then I realized that it was my dryer that was going down.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.880]   You know, was that the note you couldn't fit in your pocket
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.160]   or stuff?
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.680]   Yeah, I tried.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.200]   I broke out the note because, of course, one of the stories
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.800]   will be the new note.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.280]   Oh, that's so small.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.720]   It's so tiny.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.200]   How do you survive?
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.600]   How do you live with such a small phone?
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.040]   And we'll talk about the new note in a little bit.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.680]   Gosh, earthquakes, phantom vibrations in the Google Home
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.720]   page.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.960]   Item number one.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.360]   Wow.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.480]   Let me say this about the Home page.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.320]   I think-- I'll just go too far because that's what I do here.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.800]   I think all Home pages die.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   The notion of a Home page is there because you have to have one.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.360]   Like, you have to have cinder blocks under a house or something.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   But it's just not part of what you do.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.120]   It's happening with news sites like Crazy.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   No one goes to the Home page.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.440]   They're all coming in elsewhere.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   Or your real Home page is on Twitter, Facebook, et cetera.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.320]   And the Home-- people, all these companies,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.200]   spend all this effort going to Home pages.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.680]   If anybody comes to them as a destination, including media,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.640]   and you don't have to-- the New York Times, they do.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.440]   But otherwise, no, they don't.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.760]   So I think the Home page is absolutely meaningless.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.640]   And Google--
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.000]   I think people--
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.960]   I think that I know that we all will use Chrome
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.320]   and we'll search with it and we'll go with it.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.760]   But there are lots of people going to the Google Home page
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.400]   still.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.360]   There must be.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.120]   If they weren't, they wouldn't be bothering
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.560]   if doing this sort of thing.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.440]   Well, I think it depends on the page.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.400]   I go to the Home page at Tech meme every day.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.560]   That's a Home page.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.720]   But of course, it links deep into the page that I should be--
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.520]   so I don't go to the Verge Home page.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   I go to Tech meme's Home page and that links deep into the Verge.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.400]   I was talking with somebody I work with today.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.240]   And he said it well.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.440]   I mean, if you think about a site-- not as a site,
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.880]   but as an API, which Dave Weiner's talked about.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   That's RSS.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.360]   It's a RSS.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   It's a stream.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:57.880]   It's a river.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.000]   It's a hooks into something.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.680]   Then, yeah, you may have a page and it's your page
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.720]   and it's the one you go to, but your page is like no one else's.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.360]   And that's where I Google was starting to go.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.840]   That's because it's back to what Danny was saying.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.640]   So maybe the new experience you have with Google
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.200]   is indeed Google+.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   And by the way, yeah, you have a search box there too.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   OK.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   I mean, there you go.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's not that much more to say about the new Google Home page
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.560]   except that it is the new Google Home page.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.920]   It's theirs to mess with.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.440]   Just a bit.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.200]   I was pulling up some things here.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.480]   They have promoted as far back as like 2005 different things.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   They promoted Firefox.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.000]   Right.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.600]   I remember that.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.920]   Or they promoted Google Pack.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.160]   Everybody remember Google Pack?
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:47.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640]   Google Pack.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.320]   Google Pack.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.040]   Google Video content from NBA and CBS.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   They promoted DaVinci code, contests
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.280]   that they had going on out there.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.040]   The G1, when it came out, was promoted there.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.680]   The Nexus one.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   The Droid was promoted on the page as well.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.880]   So they've promoted lots of things that are there.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.840]   And that Meyer quote, when she said it was,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.120]   there will never be banner ads on the Google Home page.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.160]   This is in 2007.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.080]   There will never be crazy flashy graphical doodads
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.440]   flying and popping up all over the Google site ever.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.520]   And you know.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.560]   It's 2012.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   We've moved on.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   It's a long time ago.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.880]   And remember, we were all playing Pac-Man in the Google
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.840]   Doodle Doodle.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.520]   I never was complaining about that.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:30.840]   No.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.480]   That was fun.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.200]   It wasn't an ad.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.680]   That's why.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.720]   I should do an ad right now.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   No, I'm--
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.560]   No ads.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.960]   I'm going to-- I'm going to--
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.040]   no ads today.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.920]   Throwing out the ads.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.600]   No, don't throw me up to ads.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.560]   No, I don't know, actually.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.240]   I don't have the right clipboard.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.440]   That would be bad news.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   It's a very bad news.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.280]   Google has once again disclosed all the people they gave money
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.320]   to in the Oracle Google suit, including, I'm
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.400]   sad to say, the guy at Fos Patents, who-- he was being
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.560]   paid by Google or Oracle.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.880]   I can't remember.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.560]   Oracle.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.320]   And I still like Fos Patents.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.720]   But it's just kind of depressing when you find out, oh.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.160]   But a lot of them were-- that was the point.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.520]   He said, Google first said, well, nobody.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.160]   And so then they came back and they said, OK, well, this
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.480]   person who's an employee of ours did talk about this case.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.840]   And this person, like Lauren Weinstein, we've done things
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.520]   with him in the past.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.400]   And he, using his free speech, has talked about the case.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.960]   There was no one for one that said Google paid anybody
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.760]   to talk about the case.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.240]   Was there?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.320]   Well, here's the one that Mark Lemley, he's a Stanford
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.120]   professor who apparently is oft quoted without saying
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.920]   he's getting money from Google.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.520]   Then Google says, well, he's our outside counsel.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   He's sort of like a contractor?
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.920]   That's the disclosure.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.080]   And part of this is because Google initially told the court
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   in the Oracle trial that it hadn't paid anyone to comment
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.200]   on the case.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   Right.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.000]   But part of that exact thing, that says that we paid you
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.920]   to write about the case.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.040]   And unless I'm wrong and I read it very quickly,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.240]   I didn't see a case of that.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.720]   They saw, OK, all right, if you insist, here's people
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.640]   who've written about the case with whom we have a business
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.640]   relationship.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.240]   So really, it doesn't come down to-- in my opinion,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.000]   it doesn't come down to Google.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   It comes down to Florian Mueller at Fosbattons
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.040]   or Mark Lemley when they blog about the case to say, oh,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.160]   oh, by the way, I'm outside counsel for Google,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.200]   or oh, by the way.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   The cash washer--
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.440]   I mean, you know, cash washer is very good about that,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   including your personal relationships.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.840]   Right.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   Yeah, in fact, if you go to All Things D,
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.880]   you almost can't avoid the ethics disclosures.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.800]   They're big fat links pop up sometimes.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.440]   So I don't know what to say about this.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.160]   It did seem like it was a little indirect.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.440]   It wasn't like, here's some money.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.120]   Go say nice things about us.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.520]   So dumb question.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.280]   Don't lawyers pay experts to testify--
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.800]   Yes.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.760]   --to offer their opinion in cases all the time?
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   Yes.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.640]   But that's generally the law firm pays.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.800]   Well, it's understood that if you're
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.160]   coming on to testify, you're a paid expert.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.880]   In fact, I think they often--
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.640]   and if they don't, the pros and counsel will say,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.480]   well, you're a paid expert.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.400]   You'll be declared a paid expert.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.320]   I've done those sorts of cases and legal things before.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.480]   It's not hidden.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.640]   Yeah, they know.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.160]   But in this case, the court was really
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.400]   trying to understand experts that might be speaking
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.760]   about the case and writing about the case that were paid,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.320]   that were not providing legal testimony.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.520]   So they wouldn't have been declared.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.920]   The key difference seems to be if I
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.200]   understood the case with the false patents,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.080]   is that he was actually hired to do consulting for Oracle on it
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.160]   and was writing to, whereas I don't think, from what
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.480]   I understood, the outside counsel was hired just
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.000]   specifically for that case.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.200]   But I could be wrong on that as well.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   But I guess we have more clarity as to what we didn't have
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.640]   before on both sides of it.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.280]   It was kind of late coming into the case
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.280]   to ask for all that though.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.440]   Yeah, it was like when it was over.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.360]   Right.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.960]   Basically.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.880]   Just somebody can get my--
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.200]   I must have some commercials today.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.680]   I do.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.240]   OK.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.200]   Please, God.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.480]   Please, from your lips to God's ear--
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   I don't want to have to start paying you for the pleasure
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.920]   of being here.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.720]   I do have one.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.400]   Thank you.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   No, I have two.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.720]   That's wonderful.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   Why don't we do one now?
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.440]   That way we will pay some bills.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.640]   This is not exactly on our home page.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.280]   Actually, it is.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.200]   Come to think of it on our home page.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.280]   You are our home page.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.720]   But if you go to Twit.tv, I do believe there is, in fact,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.480]   a display ad.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.280]   We were talking about the value or non-value of display ads
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.640]   on Twit on Sunday.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.840]   It was a great-- actually, a great conversation, which
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.480]   Adam Curry-- oh, look.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.800]   There's a picture of you and Gina on our front page.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.160]   Aw.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   You're kind of obscured, Gina.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.520]   I apologize.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   It's OK.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.680]   Same, but I guess you took her laying down too much, Gina.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.520]   And her pull the blinds.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.640]   Our show brought to you today by our folks at Citrix,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.120]   our good friends at Citrix, who do a fabulous remote access
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.840]   app.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.640]   If you're an enterprise, you probably
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.080]   know the name Citrix, because they
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.640]   are the most famous remote access company in the world.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   They pretty much invented the business many moons ago,
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.040]   Microsoft licensed Citrix software for their remote desktop.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.080]   Citrix makes very easy to use remote access product
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.600]   called Go To My PC, which is misnamed because it works
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.880]   for both PCs and Macs.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.040]   In fact, if you're about to head out of town,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.880]   this would be a good time to install Go To My PC
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.840]   on your office computer, because then as you hit the road,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.880]   you can access that office computer anywhere,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.960]   log on to any computer or your iPhone, iPad, and Android
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.680]   tablet, and access your office computer.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.400]   That is pretty amazing when you're
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.560]   looking at your office computer on a tablet,
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.200]   and you're doing everything you could do at work.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.520]   You can run any program, send and receive email, access,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.640]   any network resource.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.040]   That is the coolest thing ever.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.320]   I want you to try it free right now.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.080]   Visit the Go To My PC website.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.320]   Click the try it free button.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.440]   The promo code is Twit.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.040]   We want you to use that just so that Jeff and Gina get
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.440]   credit.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.040]   Full credit.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.960]   Promo code T-- did I say Twit?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.480]   Twig.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.960]   TWIG.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   I blew it again.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.440]   TWIG gives them credit, and I think you will be very happy.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.800]   Easy to install.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.200]   You don't need the IT department.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.640]   You do not need to open up ports in your router or anything
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.000]   like that.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.760]   It uses a very sophisticated, nat traversal technology.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.360]   Look, see, looks nice on your tablet there.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.440]   Nexus 7 looks beautiful.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.480]   Go to my PC.com, use the offer code TWIG.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.320]   TWIG.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.120]   Google Crisis Map for Hurricane Isaac.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.800]   I guess it's been downgraded to a tropical storm.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.240]   But Google's done-- as they have done in the past,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.760]   they've done websites, part of their Google Crisis response.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.720]   That's google.org, which is interesting, slash crisis map.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.000]   And boy, it's really cool what they do here.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.280]   I think I first became aware of this
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.800]   during the Haiti earthquake.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.360]   So you can click on Active Shelters, New Orleans,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.720]   Levy System, Evacuation Information, user generated content.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.160]   You want to see YouTube videos?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   There they are.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.680]   Isn't that cool?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.040]   Compare this with a news article.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   I know.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   It's just so much more informative,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.880]   and it's so much more stuff, and it's embeddable and open.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.040]   Yeah, isn't it amazing?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.400]   I just really love what they've--
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.080]   here's the USS Alabama Battleship Park webcam.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.200]   So you can see the webcam and see the storm coming in.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.160]   They've got the path of the storm.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.000]   This is really, really, really amazing.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.360]   They've gotten really good at this.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   I mean, even over the course of just doing the show for what?
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000]   Two years or three years?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.400]   We've seen Google get so good at being
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   able to come up with these single serving sites
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.960]   during crises that are just beautiful visualizations
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.520]   and informative.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.880]   Yeah, if you're an information junkie,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.200]   we live in wonderful times.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.600]   Look at that.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.800]   I think Google's relationship to the news industry
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.040]   is what I always think about a course.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   But I think that becomes really important
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.200]   because they just become a supplier of raw information.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.040]   Now, they charge people, though.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.160]   I saw I was watching CNN, and they had--
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.760]   it said big letters, Google Map.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.880]   And I'm sure they're paying for that, right?
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.280]   I think so.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.040]   I don't know.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.880]   I think it was before a use on the web,
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.360]   but I think that the motion is valuable, too.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Yeah, but I think they actually pay for it.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.960]   So it's a revenue source as well.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.120]   Well, Google's killing the weather API, which
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.000]   is kind of interesting.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.840]   Instead, you're going to use weather underground, I guess.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.000]   That's too bad.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.240]   I actually use Google's weather service a lot.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.600]   Although, I ended up using AccuWeather on one of my widgets
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.280]   because it was more reliable.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.840]   So if you click--
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.920]   if you're using iGoogle and you click on the weather,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.480]   you'll get weather underground, not Google's API now.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.360]   Was that the only place that they were using it?
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.320]   No, like I said, they had an API.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.280]   So I had a widget--
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.760]   my beautiful weather widget--
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.640]   Oh, like on your Android phone.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.840]   --on my Android phone.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.400]   And you had a choice in the weather widget,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.920]   whether you use Google for your weather information
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.600]   or AccuWeather.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.000]   And I always ended up choosing AccuWeather
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.920]   because they didn't match.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.520]   Maybe Google didn't have-- I don't know.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   Maybe they didn't have the best weather.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   Let me see if it's still here-- widget settings, weather,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.640]   weather-- oh, I don't know.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.080]   Maybe it's-- I've been looking in the wrong place.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.920]   Weather settings-- here it is-- weather service.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.000]   Choose between AccuWeather and Google, yeah.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.800]   So that was the API.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.360]   But I always chose AccuWeather anyway.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.960]   The API apparently has been quietly closed down by Google.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.240]   So if you query the weather API, you'll
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.360]   get an error message.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   We're sorry.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.200]   But your computer network-- your computer or network
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.240]   may be sending automated queries to protect our users.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.680]   We can't process your request right now.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.760]   See Google help for a nice Python script.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.880]   I got a question for you, Danny, since you cover Google
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.320]   so make them suddenly.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.360]   If that happened at a media company,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.040]   then the people who did that product would be fired.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.800]   But I never hear that coming out of Google.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.720]   And I sense it's because people, when they start at Google,
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.000]   don't go to a particular job.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   They come to Google and get placed.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.320]   And if their job goes away, then they
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.600]   can play somewhere else.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.160]   Has this led to any displacement of people's losing jobs?
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.080]   Well, here's one.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   Currently in.net.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.880]   This is the website.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.080]   If you go to currentlyin.net, which I guess
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.960]   was a website where you could say, what's the temperature
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.640]   currently in, currently down, Google has shut down
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.120]   its undocumented weather API.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.920]   Oh, undocumented.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   That's a keyword.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.160]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.640]   I didn't know that there was a weather API.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.720]   And apparently this was a private API.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   But then they can't be held responsible.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.520]   And kind of all bets are off at that point.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.560]   To be honest, I didn't even realize
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.360]   they were running weather APIs.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.120]   I didn't think it was that much of a deal.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.480]   But in terms of them, you mean if they shut down a product,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.040]   Jeff, do people get fired?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.560]   Right.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.000]   I have never said they're bored of it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.440]   They were unhappy.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.160]   Yeah, Google Wave.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.480]   People that will get fired from Google, they just move on
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:50.920]   to other things.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.720]   They go to Facebook.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   Google doesn't-- yeah, because Google doesn't seem
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.040]   to find a reason to kind of want them to stick around.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.160]   There's any number of Googlers that
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.040]   left to go to some other company.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.840]   And it was a big splash.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.360]   And then it was, aha, see, Google is losing people.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.600]   And part of this story in that is also
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.520]   that Google might not have minded losing them.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.400]   Because when Google does mind losing people,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.080]   sometimes it really pulls out all the stops
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.920]   and you're trying to keep them.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.840]   I think the Google Wave folks were a good example of that of,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.800]   yeah, we put every single thing--
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.480]   I mean, there was nothing they could not
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.840]   put behind Google Wave.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.280]   I think it would be hard to argue they didn't get behind that
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.360]   in a big way.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.840]   And the product really didn't take off.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.160]   And at that point, it was like, well, we don't really
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.440]   have anything else to go here.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.520]   And nobody got fired that I heard of.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.760]   Or there's always a talent that's going on there.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.120]   But you just may not feel like you need to go out
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.560]   of your way to retain that talent and go further
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.880]   with it from that.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.680]   And Marissa's probably the best example of this now, right?
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.400]   I mean, here she is running Yahoo.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.040]   And she was a talent.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.520]   And sometimes people can talk about and have some debates
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.520]   on her management style and was she
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.640]   credited with doing all the things
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.280]   or she wasn't credited doing it or whatever.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.880]   But the bottom line is there was nothing left at Google
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.240]   to retain her.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   She's gone off somewhere else.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.360]   So you'd expect that in a business, right?
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.560]   They're not going to-- if somebody's not--
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.280]   if they don't have a place to go, they let them go.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.040]   Well, you'd expect that.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.400]   But then you'd also--
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.840]   in impression that Google fought that hard
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.160]   to try to retain her.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.000]   I mean, there was this shift that
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.400]   went around where she seemed to be moved off
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.320]   into this local property.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.960]   They still had other people doing local products or whatever.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.720]   And again, there's been some debate on whether or not
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.640]   she was sort of sidelined or whatnot with it from there.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.920]   And I think that on both sides, the departure
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.560]   has been very positive.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.800]   Nobody has been saying any negative things
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.000]   about each other on either side of it.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.400]   And there's a big argument that it's
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.280]   hard to figure out what you do with someone like that who
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.840]   really probably sees their next challenge running
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.680]   a company like Yahoo, rather than running yet another division
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   of Google.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.720]   But there still isn't that sort of retention.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.240]   Because imagine that--
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.400]   I don't know--
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.960]   other Google execs that might be around that are actually
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.000]   very powerful that have been put in position to power,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.880]   suddenly they're like, well, I want to go off
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   and do something else.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.800]   I think there would be much more stops that would be pulled
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.520]   out with it from there.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.640]   Counter.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.880]   I'm looking for the next story.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.720]   Let's talk about the galaxy note.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.040]   Samsung had a big event this morning at IFA, which
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.440]   is a big trade show in Berlin.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.760]   I'm not sure what IFA stands for.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.960]   International phone.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   Phone.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   Phone.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   Phone.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.080]   It's German.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.760]   It's German, yeah.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.440]   And the Samsung mobile unpacked event,
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.160]   they announced quite a few things.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.040]   There were live blogs.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.480]   There's a guy doing card tricks.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.800]   Something you won't see in an Apple keynote, I don't think.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.200]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.800]   Funkhaus Stellung.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.320]   It's the Funkhaus Stellung.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.680]   There you go.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.240]   Distance.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.320]   So it's basically communications, but it's another word.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.280]   And Stellung is a conference display of things.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.360]   Now, I'm sad I didn't go because the event opened with VIM vendors,
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.280]   one of my favorite film directors, who for some reason,
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.600]   unaccountably has been appearing in teaser videos
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.880]   for the galaxy note.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.120]   And--
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.200]   Because as you walk by Berlin, you see these things.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.280]   You need a way to note it, create.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.120]   And that's why--
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.280]   Is it Daskinda-Vassen or whatever it is?
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.040]   He was the director of Wings of Desire,
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.680]   which was a beautiful movie.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.720]   You'd be happy to know by Google Translate,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.000]   Translate International Funkhaus Stellung into IFA.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.880]   You were talking about IFA.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.920]   I kid you not.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.760]   That's exactly what it's meant to be.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.440]   That's the right translation.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.040]   So I guess VIM vendors, as you're right, Jeff,
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.480]   been doing drawings, a five-day effort
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.080]   to recreate Berlin in drawings on the note.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   They've-- you know, one of the things that I liked about the note
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.200]   is they've always really focused on not business,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.680]   but creativity.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.920]   When they introduced the note originally at CES last year,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.000]   they had artists.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.240]   They had etalles all over Las Vegas,
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.320]   with people doing sketches on the note, which I thought was cool.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.920]   And I really like the note.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   It was my phone of choice for some time until the S3 came out.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.400]   The new note is kind of a merger of the S3
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.880]   and the original Galaxy Note, 1280 by 720, which
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.360]   is not a very high DPI.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.440]   I mean, it's the same as actually as the S3,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.880]   but on a five and a half inch screen.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.960]   They are using now a non-pentile super AMOLED display.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.760]   So that's a good thing, but it's still a super AMOLED.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:19.920]   It has a quad core 1.6 gigahertz X and O's processor,
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.400]   which makes it, as far as I know, the fastest phone out there.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   And a 3,100 milliamp hour battery,
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.600]   which is also the fattest battery in a phone.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.920]   So I will order one.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   As soon as it's available, they didn't say when it would be
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.400]   available, but the thinking is perhaps--
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.440]   Well, it's going to be sold in Europe for a period of--
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.480]   As they did with the note originally and the Galaxy
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.400]   S3 originally.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.960]   Let me ask you again.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.000]   So that means that when you get it, you won't be 4G or--
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.080]   Or super-speed.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   Now, this one I think you might be 4G,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.000]   but the frequencies would be wrong.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.320]   Because they do say this is a 4G.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.840]   So you can't really get 4G.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.120]   Right.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.880]   You'll be getting HSPA+ on T-Mobile or AT&T.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.160]   I don't care about that that much.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.000]   I can't get 4G.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.480]   I'm in Betaluma.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.880]   I got nothing.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.280]   I got nothing.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.200]   Jelly Bean.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.640]   That's great.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   Jelly Bean, which is a little bit of a surprise.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.520]   We didn't expect that.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.640]   Or at least some of the rumors were there would still
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.080]   be ice cream sandwich.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:15.400]   It's powerful.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.960]   I have a rumor fee if the trial affected that.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.080]   Ah.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:19.600]   You know what?
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.520]   I bet it did.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.680]   But point.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.080]   I bet it will come without some of the Samsung stuff, right,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.320]   but I'm not sure if you know.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.760]   Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.200]   If it's pure jelly bean or if Samsung--
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.280]   They set touch whiz.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.040]   And I'm looking at it.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.840]   And that looks like touch whiz on there.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.080]   In fact, it is definitely.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.000]   Touch whiz is weird because it puts the apps icon on the right
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.080]   instead of in the middle, as every other phone does.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.320]   To color back, they're going to have the S Pen.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.200]   And it does new things.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.640]   It has a hover mode.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.280]   Look at that, though.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   That is thin and light.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.840]   And it looks a lot like a Galaxy S3 with an engorged screen.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.680]   I will be getting one.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.040]   I like the-- I really like that.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.280]   I mean, I was out today on the streets of New York
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.920]   and put this in my back pocket looking incredible.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.200]   Yeah, this is a good compromise.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.520]   It's the diagonal pocket protector.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.840]   And I love having this with me, but it is just
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.520]   a hair too big to carry around incredibly
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.960]   and be able to carry that around.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.240]   I think it may be a metric size.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.840]   I like the note.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.320]   Two gigs of RAM as opposed to the gig of RAM in the original note.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.560]   And I think in the S3.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.680]   So that's a lot of RAM.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.360]   I don't know if Jelly Bean requires it or what.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.880]   It's available in 260 partners in 128 countries in October
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.640]   and then somewhat later in the US, just as the S3 was.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:48.720]   So Samsung is not--
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.840]   is maybe back on its heels a little bit
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.360]   after the Apple Samsung decision?
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.120]   I guess we should talk about that.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   I feel like I've talked about it, but that's because--
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.240]   No, but you're talked out about it.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.080]   Well--
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.560]   I bet you all.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.760]   It happened on Friday.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.320]   And I immediately ran.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.520]   And we did not expect-- we thought, oh, it'll be later this week.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.360]   I thought it'd be after Twig this week.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.880]   Because I mean, how could a jury possibly
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.440]   rule on something after three weeks of testimony,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.960]   109 pages of jury instructions, 33 question, 20 page verdict--
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.120]   from couldn't possibly decide that in three days they did.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.160]   And I came back.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.040]   And now that we've heard from the jury,
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.440]   they apparently didn't understand the case at all.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.120]   But that's OK, because I think that in hindsight,
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.280]   they probably made the right decision.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.440]   They said they were most influenced by the emails
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.920]   from the Samsung executives when the iPhone came out,
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.520]   saying there's a crisis in design.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.160]   We've got to respond to this.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.720]   They said that to them was evidence proof positive
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.560]   that Samsung set out to copy the iPhone.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.000]   And it's true that the earliest Samsung phones looked
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.760]   off a lot like the iPhone.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.240]   And I think that's what swayed them.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.640]   They were not ruling on newer phones like the Galaxy S3
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.840]   or the Galaxy Note.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.360]   They were ruling on patents that were affecting--
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.800]   the most recent phone in effect was the Galaxy S2.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.600]   The judge will decide on December 6,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.000]   he's going to have another hearing on whether some of those
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.560]   phones that are still being sold will be blocked in the US.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.120]   That's unknown.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.240]   She also has the right to triple the damages,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.400]   because the jury ruled that the infringement was willful.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.200]   $1.05 billion in damages, the judge
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.160]   could make that $3 billion plus.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.720]   And finally, and I think maybe underreported,
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.400]   the jury decided that none of the tablets violated Apple
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.680]   patents, only the phones.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.360]   Any thoughts?
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.880]   Anybody?
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.160]   Danny, what do you think?
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.520]   I'm sure you've also talked out on this subject.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.760]   The past stuff largely I just had left to others.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.000]   It got into so many different nuances
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.280]   and these different debates.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.800]   I think the big takeaway from this
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.240]   was really the Google response that came back saying,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.120]   this isn't going to go to core Android.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.480]   I think some people have taken this like,
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.160]   ah-ha, now Android's dead.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.400]   And no, it's not necessarily dead.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.240]   It seems to be going to certain design aspects of the icon,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.480]   certain design aspects in terms of whether you do the pinch
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.200]   the zoom, that sort of stuff.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.280]   And it looks like these are things
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.440]   that you could work around.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.320]   And in fact, some people are working around.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.240]   One of the crazy things I found with the S3
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.160]   that I've been testing is that they've
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.960]   got all this touch with stuff.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.000]   And if I throw my phone in the air and clap three times,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.200]   it'll send a message for me to where
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.360]   is if I bounce it twice on my desk,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   they've got all these new gesture things in there
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.200]   that almost feel like they're trying to come up with gestures
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.840]   that weren't gestures that anybody else might have.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.480]   And I don't know, I tend to strip a lot of this stuff off
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.840]   anyway and just use it straight.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.760]   So I think the Android operating system's
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.800]   going to continue on.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.640]   I think this will be more of a road bumper, speed bump to it.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.000]   I'm sure Samsung would be hecking a lot happier
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.360]   if they didn't have all the jokes about, well,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.000]   I guess you just copied Apple coming off to them.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.640]   But it's not going to be this big reversal, I don't think.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.560]   And I think it's also interesting that for all the upset
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.400]   that Apple had with it, these things
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.280]   seem to be relatively minor into why people would have actually
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.520]   picked a Samsung phone over an iPhone.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.320]   I mean, I just haven't seen anything in general.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.320]   People are saying, oh, thank goodness it had pinched a zoom.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.640]   That's what made me pick.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.960]   When I talk to people about why--
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.520]   because I always see people with phones.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.040]   I'm always like, why do you have that phone?
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.880]   What do you have this phone?
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.920]   And it's like, it was small.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Right.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.440]   Right?
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.840]   No, it was big.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.760]   It was cheap.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.880]   I'm with my carrier.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.000]   It was like the things that had nothing
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.200]   to do with the things that you would expect them to go
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.080]   for the iPhone.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.240]   It just amazes me sometimes.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.640]   Because iPhone, the iPhone to be a really, really great
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.240]   experience.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.960]   And so to me, the biggest downside to it
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.680]   tends to be that it doesn't have LTE.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.560]   And I say that as somebody who uses an Android phone
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.280]   on a regular basis.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.880]   And I still, when I go back to the iPhone,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.840]   I kind of like almost breathe this eye of relief.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.960]   Because a lot of it feels very intuitive and very elegant,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.280]   very clean, and I'm not having to struggle with it.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.680]   So there's more to people making their choices than just
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.800]   beyond, hey, it's awesome iPhone.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.920]   That's why I'm going for it.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.960]   Not everybody agrees with that.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   More of it.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.320]   That's the price.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.120]   What do you guys buy?
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.080]   I think Mike Algin repeated a lot of these posts on Google
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.160]   Plus.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.520]   The idea that overhearing people saying, well,
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.600]   gee, if they're the same, I should have spent a lot less
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.400]   to get an Android.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.000]   I thought that was funny.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.880]   I thought that was really anecdotal, though.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.760]   I mean, it was a fascinating post where it was a mic
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.880]   or somebody who was saying, I was in a Starbucks,
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.840]   and I heard four different people come in.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.480]   And they all were talking about the news.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.440]   And if it was exactly the same, I paid how much for this
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.800]   computer or whatever.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.000]   But I don't buy that.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.160]   I'm not sure about it.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.440]   There's more to the gadgets, especially with the Apple
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:40:59.920]   devices.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.240]   I think what's happening is that they've built up
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.880]   this entire ecosystem of--
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.400]   my phone can talk to my computer.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.680]   They can talk to the iCloud, which can talk to my Apple TV.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.760]   I'm buying all my content through it.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.920]   I'm locking it in there.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.600]   Now I've got 2,000 music songs that I bought that are all
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.800]   in the cloud.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.000]   And I think that's going to be much more important
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.480]   as to why you're going to stay with a particular device
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.400]   than another device.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.760]   That's also why I think the Nexus 7 was such an important
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.800]   thing for Google, because it really
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.680]   should have been called the Google Play in some ways.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.400]   Because it really crystallized what they did with Google Play,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.480]   which was to say, we don't have an Android market anymore.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.800]   We have this thing called Google Play.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.680]   And it's where you buy content for Google.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.640]   And it's where you can get your movies and all your stuff
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.320]   or whatever.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.800]   And it's not an Android-specific type of thing.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.000]   And that's sort of our iTunes that comes with it.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.960]   And the Nexus 7 itself kind of really crystallized that I
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.280]   think when you turn that thing on, and it's like your content,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.520]   it's the main screen that you see.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.120]   It just really highlights that the--
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.280]   what one of the focuses in these devices
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.520]   isn't just what they necessarily do in terms of,
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.120]   can I bounce back or can I pinch the zoom?
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.640]   But where can I get my content streaming to them through it?
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.880]   Yeah, I think consumers are smarter than--
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.160]   both simultaneously smarter and dumber than we think.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.720]   I think they know the difference.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.480]   They completely know the difference.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.720]   And a lot of the things we care a lot about,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.920]   they couldn't care less about.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.360]   And they make decisions for a lot of simpler reasons.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.840]   What do you think about the decision, Jeff Jarvis, Samsung
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.960]   versus Apple?
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   I was just disappointed in the war where we find ourselves.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.640]   I think Samsung's response that, gee, it's amazing
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.000]   that you can own rectangles with rounded edges.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.840]   I think we've lost the sense of the definition of innovation.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.960]   And design innovation will sure Apple has proved that often
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.400]   times, but I think that we're protecting the wrong things.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.280]   We talked last week about copyright,
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.720]   and I argued that it should change to a notion of protecting
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.600]   credit.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.880]   That's easier to think of in text and ideas.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.520]   The bigger question to me--
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.960]   and I don't know what to think about this.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.360]   I honestly don't.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.000]   Are we past the idea of ideas as property and ownership?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.080]   What would the world look like if we didn't have that doctrine?
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.480]   And I'm not sure I like that world.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.880]   I'm not sure I want that world.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.560]   I'm not necessarily advocating that.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.840]   But none of this is helping do what it's supposed to do,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.480]   which is spur innovation and get innovation made public
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.000]   and shared.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.240]   It's doing the opposite.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.760]   Right.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.440]   Could this be good for Google, though?
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.000]   I mean, could this decision discourage manufacturers
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.920]   from trying to make products that look--
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.040]   look, I have to tell you, I kind of agree with the jury.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.800]   I mean, I didn't follow the trial very closely the whole way.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.760]   But you look at some of the pictures of those phones.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.200]   I remember when that phone came out thinking, wow, they're
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.480]   clearly just trying to make a low-end iPhone.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.680]   That was my gut reaction to it.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.240]   And I think Farhad Manju wrote a great piece--
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.880]   I love the farted sound.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.440]   Yes.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.280]   Yeah, I mean, when the iPhone was a big hit,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.240]   companies had three choices-- do nothing, try to copy it,
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.760]   or I try to invest the R&D to make something more innovative.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   And it looks like Samsung kind of chose path number two,
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.880]   and now they're paying for it.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.560]   And this decision was not about Android.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.320]   It was about these particular Samsung products.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.280]   And I think Google sees Jelly Bean as kind of the solution
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.960]   to their lawsuit problems, because Jelly Bean really
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.520]   is starting to differentiate itself very much so from iOS.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.960]   And so in a way, this may encourage more manufacturers
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.160]   to stick either with the pure Google experience
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.640]   or to make an experience that looks very different.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.400]   I want things that are different.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.880]   No, I agree.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.840]   I think the jury, even though they did it for the wrong reasons,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.920]   did the right thing.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.520]   Samsung knew it.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.040]   They thought the billion dollar fine,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.400]   even if it's a $3 billion fine, is in effect their R&D budget
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.240]   for their early smartphones.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.160]   It gave them enough leverage in the market.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.200]   They became the number two, in fact, down number one,
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.320]   smartphone company.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.400]   And it's clear with things like the Note and the Galaxy S3,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.240]   they're innovating.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.240]   They're innovating.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.600]   Samsung just a proxy, though.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.720]   Was this really against Samsung?
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.600]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.080]   Why not sue Google?
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.520]   I read something like, well, you can't really sue Google
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.680]   because they didn't have a product.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.720]   They didn't make phones.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.120]   Right.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.400]   You could sue them, but you wouldn't get any damages.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.880]   Because the damages are based on commercial losses.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.160]   They're not punitive.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.920]   It's what did this cost in the marketplace,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.000]   and you can't prove that Google cost anybody anything
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.720]   because they didn't sell anything.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.480]   But I think that also it's clear that the jury was really
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   punishing touch whiz and Samsung.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.280]   I don't think this is Google by proxy.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.040]   No.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.000]   I just fear what comes next.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.480]   Is Apple now emboldened to do that?
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.560]   No, I think they're exhausted.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.680]   And I'm hoping that what will actually happen
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.560]   is that everybody will come down to the table.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.520]   OK, we've proved our point.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.200]   Now let's license.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   We're not going to ask.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.600]   And everybody will sit down at the table,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.280]   and then we're just going to handle this.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.520]   Yeah, I'll bounce back scrolling.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.960]   You take the 3G patent.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.640]   Right.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.920]   And I think Samsung's taken that stuff out.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.160]   Steve Gibson was pointing out there's no bounce back scrolling
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.600]   in the Nexus 7.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.560]   That's Apple's patent.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.720]   They didn't put it in here.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.800]   It doesn't bounce back.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.160]   Is there tap zoom?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.480]   There is, isn't there?
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.000]   It's certainly pinching.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.400]   Yeah, that's an interesting point.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.480]   The tap zoom is cool.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.200]   That's the thing that means that when you're looking
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.320]   at a small version of a website--
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.200]   let me do this in Chrome.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.800]   You're looking at a small version of a website.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.320]   And you want to zoom in on a paragraph.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.160]   I'm going to find some text here.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.480]   Let's do this.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.120]   Unfortunately, all of this is already zoomed.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.160]   Go to a newspaper store here.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.840]   Yeah, you've got to go to CNN or something.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:14.960]   NY times-- and this is the Nexus 7, of course.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.080]   So this is what Apple invented really was,
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.880]   we're going to render the whole page.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.200]   And then you want to read this article.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.760]   You double tap it.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   You see it doesn't zoom exactly like Apple did.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.240]   Apple would zoom like that.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.000]   Right.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.960]   That's not necessarily-- it depends
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.040]   on what you're looking at.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.080]   Go to a particular article.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.880]   If you double tap, it'll zoom into the whole article content.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   Um, give it a second though.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.080]   Let it just let it load.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.600]   Now tap it.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.200]   OK, now let's say I want to read this paragraph.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.680]   On the iPhone, Danny, wouldn't if I double tap that paragraph,
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.880]   it would fit that to the width of the screen, right?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.640]   I think it'll bring the whole article up.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.280]   Double tap, let me see what happens.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.400]   See, I think this is--
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.600]   No, that's-- because the column above, it did a jog.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.040]   So it is, in fact, seen--
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.640]   Is it fit to the left of the plate?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.680]   Here, so let's take this paragraph.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.840]   Yeah, it did the full thing there.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.440]   I don't know.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.920]   But just the squeeze that I can't--
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.520]   I need to go back through with the things
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.920]   like the pinch and the multigestar.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.440]   I mean, those were things that I remember when the iPhone
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.320]   first came out that were like, wow.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:18.820]   Right.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.640]   It's the first time I've ever seen this stuff.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.480]   It was slightly distinguishing points.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.740]   And I think the difficulty is, you know, you say, well,
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.440]   should you be able to patent something like that?
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.240]   Doesn't make sense.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:34.160]   But I don't know who invented the telephone keypad that
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.120]   got us off of dialing, right?
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.800]   But at some point, somebody said, hey, why don't we
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.720]   do touch tones?
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.440]   And why don't we have a touch tone pad?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.160]   And maybe we should patent that sort of thing.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   And then somebody else comes along and may say, right, well,
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:45.880]   that's obvious.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.520]   You should have that.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   I'm going to make that too.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.120]   And well, it wasn't necessarily obvious to the person
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.960]   who created it.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.880]   And where do you go about making sure that somebody who came up
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.040]   with that idea actually does get paid for it,
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.280]   or does get to be able to license it or whatever?
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   As opposed to somebody else saying, oh, well,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.160]   I'll just make all the push button circular.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.800]   And then now it's that's fine.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.000]   Or I'll--
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.680]   Andy, it's also about the norms that we use ourselves.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.600]   So let's say that, you know, who owns OK?
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.520]   We all know that means OK if you're really dorky and old,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.640]   because nobody actually does it anymore,
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.000]   but I could think of it as an example.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.560]   This got old-fashioned.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.080]   So now hand gestures that mean something that
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.560]   means something to your computer.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.240]   Oh, well, now that it means something to a computer,
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.720]   not to a human, now we can own that.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:40.640]   So obviously, turning the page, being, being,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.280]   is that something you really own?
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:42.840]   Yeah, fine.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.040]   You enabled it, but you took a human behavior
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.400]   that makes sense to humans, and you gave them that back.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.120]   And so you should be able to restrict anybody else
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.040]   from getting in that.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.080]   Because patent law says if it's obvious to an expert
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.880]   in the arts, then it can't be patented.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   Well, but that's what the argument was.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.080]   So it's much of what was really not about patents at all.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.040]   It was about design.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.040]   Well, OK, design is another-- you're right.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.560]   Design patents, trade dress, that's a different issue.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.280]   And that only comes down to did Samsung
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.400]   try to confuse consumers by making it look the same.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.880]   But in terms of software patents-- I mean, by the way,
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.080]   that's a separate conversation from Samsung Apple.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.760]   Because Samsung Apple is about the law as it stands today.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.400]   And it won.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   Apple won, based on the law as it stands today.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.040]   Should we change the law? Absolutely.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.800]   17 years for a software patent?
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.680]   What?
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.360]   That's crazy if you have software patents at all.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.240]   But the law does say if it's obvious, it has to innovate.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.680]   It has to be something clever and innovative, otherwise--
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.800]   That's what's saying is I think that we've gotten away
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.440]   from the definition of innovation.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.160]   We've lowered the bar of the definition of innovation
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.480]   so far that we've rounded rectangles to use
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.000]   Samsung's example is now called innovative.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.720]   And innovative, sorry, British influence.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:03.080]   But that's-- so there is a better interpretation there.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.520]   What does-- so the law says be innovative
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   and how the judge and jury interprets what is innovative
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   is something that is still on the horizon.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   It's true.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.920]   But like Danny said earlier, I remember the earliest iPhone
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.280]   commercials when they were showing full web pages
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.720]   on Safari on the phone and being able to tap--
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.920]   That was cool.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.720]   That was cool.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.120]   I remember reacting to that.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.720]   And being like, oh, that's--
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   I agree.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.120]   And I think that the most innovative design
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.480]   and successful designs seems so obvious in retrospect.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.720]   I mean, that's certainly I wasn't designing touchscreen
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.760]   apps at that time.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.680]   And I wonder if you would put 10 different touchscreen
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.280]   designers in separate rooms and said, OK, what would happen
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.000]   on these different actions or what actions would a user use?
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.480]   Many of the few of them may come up with the same solutions
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.520]   that Apple came up with.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.320]   But even that bounceback scrolling,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.600]   I was talking about this with my wife.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.120]   She was like, that just seems so obvious.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:04.000]   And I was like, well, but not back in 2006 when these things
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.520]   that didn't exist.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.160]   But here's another way to look at them.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.080]   Web8791, who I'm sure is how all her friends know her.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.880]   She said innovation will cost you $30 a piece, right?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.240]   Because that's what Apple asked for.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.920]   The opening bid was $30 a piece.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.680]   So what we're really talking about here-- so Danny,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.760]   you said you deserve to get paid if you come up with that.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.400]   OK, I'll buy that.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.960]   But is the market really better off
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.880]   if every phone costs $30 more?
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.360]   Well, how does that serve--
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.040]   No, only Apple's better off, but that's the only--
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.720]   that's the point of patent law is that the inventor gets
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.480]   to reap the benefits of their invention
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.280]   for a certain period of time.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.240]   By the neck to do so.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   And the people who know--
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   Well, that's the point of frand.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.400]   And then I agree.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.440]   I mean, that's the point of frand licensing.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.160]   But then you invent your own other gesture, other way
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.200]   that you want to go and figure out a way to do it.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.720]   Could be promoting innovation, I think.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.480]   You got to do this.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.360]   Don't copy Apple, do it your own way.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.400]   Right, which is fine.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.520]   Or you take something that becomes a standard, becomes a norm
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.360]   that we all take.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.520]   And now you can't do that.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.000]   You have to do this if you use another device,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.080]   because of the way the patent structure is set up.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.800]   I'm not trying to argue, throw it out,
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.760]   and you write Leo that's a different discussion.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.920]   But I think we have to get to some more fundamental issues here.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:25.000]   Just as with copyright, we've struggled with what
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.120]   does it mean to own a copy?
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.440]   And how does that work in a world where copies are free to make?
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.480]   And so on and so forth.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.320]   I think we have to address the same fundamental issues
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.120]   when it comes to patents.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.840]   And we are as a discussion.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.200]   But I don't think we're there yet in thinking about what
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.160]   does this mean for the market?
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:42.920]   Oh, I think we are.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.680]   And I think these big lawsuits--
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.520]   Google Motorola versus Oracle versus Google,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.000]   and now Apple versus Samsung.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.120]   Those big lawsuits are bringing it into the foreground.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.360]   And I think that we are actually thinking about it.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.880]   Well, we may be, but who--
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   I think everybody is.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.520]   Well, it's like lawyers who are quite well off with us.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.440]   But I mean, Apple won this round.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.640]   They won this round.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.200]   There are other cases that are still up against them.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.000]   And it may be that down the line,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.440]   they're not going to win this sort of thing.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.480]   And they may have the same sort of incentive of saying,
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.320]   right, let's come up with our own solution to this.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.840]   Let's do more of the cross licensing
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.240]   and all this other stuff.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.480]   But if it really was the case of, hey,
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.600]   we just wanted to pay $30 to do this or whatever.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.400]   Maybe you should pay $30.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.480]   That's an awful lot.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:29.920]   My phone.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.320]   I can say is when Google plunks down billions of dollars
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.480]   for Motorola primarily because they want patents,
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.640]   or people with patent portfolios,
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.080]   are getting huge amounts of money,
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.280]   even if people aren't necessarily using those patents,
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.240]   and it's just protection.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.800]   It's like buying domain names, but worse.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.720]   Do you know how you ever take it out of patent?
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.560]   No, I haven't.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.280]   Oh, do you know?
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   And I'm sure you've done things that were patentable.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.080]   Probably.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.680]   No doubt.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.520]   So did you-- did you-- did you--
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.640]   you know, and now you're in a startup where,
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.160]   at some point, investors are going to worry about this
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.280]   and so and so forth.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.200]   Have you gone through a Q&A with yourself about,
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.480]   should I be looking at patents, or no, I don't want to,
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.080]   or I'd be a fool if I didn't, or--
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.360]   I mean, I thought about it in the context of doing this show.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.120]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.800]   I see-- sometimes, see software developers kind of on their
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   resume list patents that they own as a good point,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.760]   as a positive point.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.080]   I always kind of feel an ambivalent about it.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.080]   I mean, it's tough.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   Look, when you go into business, right,
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.160]   you have a patent that can raise your valuation.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.120]   It can be something that's attractive to investors or not.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.280]   You know, I've never been in a position.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.680]   I've never worked for a company that
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.760]   asked that I file a patent, like Andy did at Yahoo, Andy--
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.440]   Andy Beyer wrote that great piece about how,
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.560]   when his company was acquired by Yahoo,
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.720]   they encouraged engineers to file patents and said that they
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.040]   would only use them defensively.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.880]   And so he did it because they got a little bonus if they did.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.600]   And now, his patents are being used offensively,
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.560]   and he's upset that his name is on these patents.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.680]   And I think things like the Twitter's IPA,
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.280]   I think I figured it's innovators patent agreement.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.680]   That's something I would love to use in our company.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.920]   If we do go down the patent road, honestly, it's just not
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.880]   something I've cared enough to do myself.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.480]   I've never felt that compelled to file a patent for my own work
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.280]   just for myself.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:21.560]   Right.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.960]   And there's no point in filing a patent
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.720]   unless you're willing to go to court to defend it.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.440]   And you want to do that.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.600]   Right, exactly.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   Unless you already have lawyers on retainer by the bushel.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.880]   It's not-- you know, we have that same issue.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.520]   I trademarked "Twit in the Twit" logo,
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.520]   because it seemed prudent.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.320]   But then when I started pursuing people,
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:48.120]   I realized the cost of doing so was so high that it's not
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:48.640]   worth it.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.320]   The cost-- and by the way-- and this
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.600]   is, I think, the judge was alluding this a little bit--
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.840]   in not merely financial cost, but the cost in your reputation.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.040]   This impacts the reputation of both Samsung and Apple.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.520]   And that's hard to measure.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.360]   One doesn't know how that will play out.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.080]   I think that in the long run, what's
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.800]   going to happen is these companies are going to sit down
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:13.440]   at the table and say, we don't want to do that anymore.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.000]   In fact, I don't think if Chief's jobs hadn't conceived
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.640]   of this in the first place, Apple might not
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.880]   have gone this far down this road.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.000]   This may be Steve Jobs' legacy.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.560]   Anything else?
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.000]   Among some innovations Samsung talked about today
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.160]   at their mobile unpacked conference,
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.080]   besides the Galaxy Note 2, a new Galaxy camera.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.040]   Apple doesn't have one of those running
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:43.800]   on Jelly Bean, the 16 megapixel sensor, built in Wi-Fi, 3G,
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.880]   and 4G, and Samsung's kind of, dare I say, patented.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:54.800]   ginormous 4.8-inch LCD screen.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.040]   That's an interesting product, huh?
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.040]   Apple doesn't have one of those.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.000]   Is it a camera with Android?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.760]   Was it Nikon?
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.260]   No.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:00.600]   Who was it?
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.080]   Nikon also has an Android camera,
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.520]   but it was running gingerbread.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.800]   Right.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.640]   I think this also has Wi-Fi and 3 and 4G,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.960]   which is really interesting.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.480]   And it doesn't have Siri, but it does have voice control
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.960]   for when your hands are full.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.120]   Photo management, shot, share.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.320]   Remember, that's the big thing they've
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.800]   been pushing with the Galaxy S3.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.560]   And I like this.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:29.360]   If you have an S3, you can use a remote viewfinder.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.520]   Somebody else has the camera.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.040]   I don't know why that's useful.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.080]   But interesting.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   That's innovation.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.080]   It's fine.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   It's fine.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.080]   It's fine.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080]   Samsung innovates.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.080]   I don't think there's any question about that.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.080]   They also announced, and I think this is very interesting,
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   a 4.8-inch Windows 8 phone, the Samsung Ativ.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.080]   And very much like the giant screen phones,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   that's-- I'm sorry.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.080]   This is the Windows RT tablet.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   They also are doing a Windows 8 phone.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.440]   So this is the Ativ Smart PC running WinNT or RT.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.000]   God, that's so confusing.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.920]   Windows RT.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.080]   And then they're going to do a phone with the same brand name.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   Very weird name.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   Ativ.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.360]   Like the way you're saying it, I would have never thought
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.080]   that that's how you spell it.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   Ativ.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   It probably stands for something.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:29.240]   They're going to do an Ativ tablet, also Windows 8.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   And the Ativ S, the Windows 8 device, phone, 4.8-inch screen,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:41.240]   2300-millionth battery, 8 megapixel camera, NFC,
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   chic, hairline design.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.240]   I don't know what that is.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   So I think Samsung-- this is the message from Samsung.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   Okay, Apple, you got us on the Fasten 8, the Captivate.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   But we're way beyond that now.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   We're doing different stuff.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   Was there any mention of the suit I presume not?
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]   I doubt it.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   Oh, joke or anything.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   No joke.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   No.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   Not that I know of.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.240]   I wasn't watching, so I'm just--
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   Well, there are going to be appeals.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   I mean, it's not--
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   It ain't over, right.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240]   Far from it.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   Nobody's paying any money for a long, long time.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.240]   Meanwhile, a smartphone market is exploding internationally.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:32.240]   This is an interesting article from the Flurry Blog.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   The countries with the greatest number of active iOS and Android devices.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   US, of course, number one with 165 million, then China, 128 million,
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.240]   UK, South Korea, Japan.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   The fastest growing iOS in Android markets, though, China, Chile, Brazil, Argentina,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   Iran, 400% growth in China.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   Countries with the highest penetration of smartphones among adults.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   Singapore, 92% of Singaporeans use smartphones, 87% in Hong Kong, 86% in Sweden.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   US is only 78%.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   That's higher than I would have thought, though.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.240]   Yeah, it is.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   And the interesting thing about the US is that it's still holding that those numbers are higher
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.240]   in African-American and Hispanic markets.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   It's a leapfrog situation.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.240]   Yeah, right.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   For those markets are ahead in mobile and smartphone as a means of getting to the internet, which really is baffling media
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   at other companies is what to do about it.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   I would love to see these numbers compared to computer usage.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.240]   Many of these companies, many of these countries, people are going directly to a smartphone, right?
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   Because they don't have a computer in their living room.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   But in the US, many households probably, I would guess, have big screen computers.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   Florida says the rate of iOS and Android device adoption has surpassed that of any consumer technology in history,
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:09.240]   10 times faster than the 80s PC revolution, two times faster than the internet, three times faster
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   than social network adoption.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   But cell phones per se, does it say?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   Doesn't.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Cell phone market grew pretty fast, but...
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   It was pretty fast, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   What cable I guess was slow from its beginning days?
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   640 million iOS and Android devices in use last month.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   640 million, which is interesting because there's a billion users on Facebook, but then only half of them are real,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   so I guess that makes sense.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   [laughter]
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   That was also a...
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   That was interesting, wasn't it?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.240]   Only like 150 of them are real.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   Adam Curry, that's what he said.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.240]   He said it was about one-tenth of the total numbers, actually, people.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   Other people.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   The rest were on the moon.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   Yeah, the rest of them were on the dark side of the moon.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   So any day now, Facebook should hit one billion users, even though...
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   So let's talk about this for a second.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.240]   Because there's been...
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   So it was going through, prepping for the show earlier today and just to the Google News search on Facebook.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   It's one after another of people slamming Facebook, Twitter is going to live, and Facebook's going to die.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   Mark Zuckerberg, the company's worth a lot more if he leaves.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.240]   Facebook's a disaster.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   A billion people are using it still.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   Well, but this is why.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.240]   I mean, if you have a billion users and you still can't figure out how to make money...
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   But they are just not enough yet.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   Well, unless every quarter...
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   Well, that's the...
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   It's gone the wrong way, Jeff.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   It's not a good point, Jeff.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   The number of users is going this way, and the amount of money is going this way.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   That's kind of a...
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   I can see why the market might be a little antsy about the whole thing.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   They have to lick...
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   And actually, Danny, you'd probably be good on this.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   They have to lick the mobile problem, right?
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   Yes.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.240]   More and more people use Facebook, but they're all using it on mobile devices, which don't show ads.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.240]   Well, they can easily insert the ads whenever they want to get around to it.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   It's different, though, isn't it?
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   On mobile, you can...
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   You know, we can ignore ads easily on big screens, but unless...
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   Well, if you go...
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   But yeah, but if you're going into your newsfeed, you just...
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   And they already are.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   Insert items that are news items into the middle of your feed.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   And there they are.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.240]   So, you know, that's...
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.240]   Or you do other things if you want.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   You start transforming any links to an outbound site into an affiliate link, and then that turns it into some money.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   There's all sorts of things you can do.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   I just get the impression they haven't been bothered to get around to doing it.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   There's no hurry, as Mark Zuckerberg said.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   Well, now there's probably more of a hurry, because, you know, you've got these investors that are freaking out,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   because they're not going to make all this growth that they thought they were going to be getting,
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   even though they're still making lots and lots of money.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.240]   Right.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   But yeah, they can solve those sorts of problems that they want to.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   Yeah, I mean, it seems like there's so many opportunities for mobile, for location-based ads.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   Right.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   And there's no hurry.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   It really is.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   They're making, you know, what is its couple billion a year anyway, and they're fine.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   There was a survey where I think that people were saying they would spend like $10 a year to buy Facebook.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.240]   And one of the things I wonder is if we'll get down the line where you not buy Facebook,
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   but buy, you know, to buy an ad-free Facebook.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   But it would be interesting to see what happened if Facebook said, "Hey, you know, you're welcome to use the website for free.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.240]   If you want the app, it's going to cost you $10."
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   And whether people might decide, you know, it's valuable enough I do want to pay for it.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   Doesn't even have to be $10.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   What if it's $5 or $3 for the mobile?
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   Yeah, I mean, it's $4.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   A dollar.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   A dollar.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.240]   Well, you say that.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   You say that, but I mean, people spend a dollar on the stupidest gains.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240]   That's not the point.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   It's the essence of the business, Danny.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.240]   If the essence of the business in the long run is that Facebook knows more about you than anybody else,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   and Facebook can then, when it finally gets smart advertisers, can target wisely.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   The question is not, people will pay for it.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.240]   The question is where will they make more money?
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.240]   And that's the issue constantly with media, is that what people should pay because they used to pay.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240]   That's not the point.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   It's completely beside the point.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.240]   The point is, where do you best put your resources and effort and where are you going to make the most money?
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   And I don't think Facebook is ever going to make the most money by charging for itself.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   No, I think that you have to go through that kind of balancing act.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.240]   I think they could also do things though if they wanted to where you get a Facebook premium app
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.240]   and put any old thing in there and you're going to have people who decide they want to buy Facebook premium.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.240]   And perhaps you even get surprised by what happens with it from there.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.240]   You may have some people who really don't want the tracking and decide, okay, you know, you can pull the app net
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   and flip it around and say, hey, you don't want to be the product, okay, then pay $50 a year.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   Here you go.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   Right.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   But now-
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   You see the other thing is, and I deal with this with my students,
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   when you sell a product, there is a customer acquisition cost
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   that in the case of subscription products is much greater than the revenue you get in the first year to three years
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   because you don't really make it up unless people continue on.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   And so it's a huge investment to charge for a product.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:09.240]   The New York Times spent $30 million to build its meter and then $13 million to operate it in the first year,
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.240]   most of that is marketing.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   Did you take Apple, for example?
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   I mean, I've got iCloud and it was free, right?
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   But I needed more storage.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.240]   They already made the investment to give me a certain amount of it.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:27.240]   I shelled out the $25 on two different accounts for myself and for my wife, just because I needed more storage.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.240]   It was easier to do it.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.240]   Wasn't going to be-
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240]   Yeah, and that's fine.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   That's fine.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   But that's not the essence of Apple.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.240]   I keep saying, okay, you've got 100 million photos that are up there.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   Do you want to keep them there?
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.240]   Do you want to keep this stuff going?
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.240]   Or do you want to have these additional things?
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.240]   This is what it's going to cost you.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   I guess I can just see them doing this sort of stuff.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   I agree with you.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   I don't think that's their big priority.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.240]   I think it's even lower priority than what we do about getting more mobile ads that are out there.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   I think 4-2 is doing an incredible job of mobile.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   I mean, I'm pretty- I don't click on ads.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   I generally don't interact with ads.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   I use 4-2.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   4-2 has this American Express.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   I have made so much money on that.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   I have too.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   And it makes a great catching sound.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   It's awesome.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   It's an awesome user experience.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   It feels good.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   You feel like you're saving money.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   I mean, you have to-
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   But wait a minute.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   How can they be making money if they're giving me five bucks back?
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.240]   It's only what?
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.240]   They only give it to you once.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   No!
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240]   They don't.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.240]   I've twice now gone to the same Chinese restaurant.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.240]   And I've consciously pulled out my American Express card because of that deal.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.240]   You have to check in.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   And then you have to hook up your card with 4-square.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240]   And then it goes kuching.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.240]   And I get five bucks back.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.240]   I had $15 meal.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240]   I paid 10 bucks for it.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   I'll have to check on it again.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   Because I signed up for it.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   I did it twice.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.240]   And then it was like- I didn't get it for the second time.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   I was like, what?
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240]   I went through all this hassle to sign up.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   You get-
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   If I don't-
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   Worked for me twice.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   Worked for me twice.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   I've done it a few times.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   I think I've done it like four or five times.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.240]   I mean, setting up- linking your card.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.240]   I was sort of wary.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.240]   And I wasn't sure.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.240]   But I was like, all right, let me try it.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.240]   But once you do that, once you get through the setup, you just say like-
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   And then it's-
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   You know, claim this on my card.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.240]   And then it just gets-
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240]   There's no scenario.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.240]   Pretty much every restaurant in Petaluma is doing this.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   I have saved so much money.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   But I don't think there's a- I don't think there's a business model.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.240]   Was American Express giving them five bucks?
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.240]   Who's making money on this?
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   Let me give you one.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240]   I had it entirely stopped using my American Express card.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   They did foreign exchange things.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   I couldn't stand it.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   They didn't couse-
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.240]   You know, members since 1970, whatever, they didn't give it rats' rump.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   I completely stopped and I used my United Airlines card.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.240]   Well, you know, I went to the US Open and spent 25 bucks here, which is easy to do.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.240]   You know, it's like a hot dog.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   And we'll give you 10 bucks back.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   So it brings me back in the fold, which goes back to the point-
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.240]   Aah!
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   Customer acquisition and retention costs.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240]   It's a marketing cost.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240]   It's all it is.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   It's making us talk about it right now.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.240]   You're talking about your friends, people are using it.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   So who pays you as American Express?
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240]   I think in Great Measure, yes.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   I'm sure there's a joint deal that goes across.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240]   There's value here for the restaurant.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   There's value for Foursquare.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   There's value for American Express.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.240]   Right.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   How that's-
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.240]   Divid up.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   I have no idea.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.240]   And full disclosure is I'm working with Foursquare for one of the companies I work with.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   And you're right, they're very smart and doing wonderful things, but they're just at the
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   beginning stage.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   So at this point, they learn.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   Plus, the other value that comes out of this, we talked about this last week with Square,
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.240]   is the more they know about your transactions and can tie it to you and where you are and
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   all this other data.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.240]   One of the key things about Foursquare when a media company ties up with Foursquare is that
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.240]   they- and if the user, only if the user hooks together the assignments.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   Right?
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   So the user is saying, "It's okay for you to know who I am."
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   Then the media company knows more about that user and where they go and what they want
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.940]   and so on than they have ever known ever.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:53.560]   That data, if they can figure out- this is the heart or the fore of the Facebook problem.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.560]   If they can figure out how to use that data and exploit it to economic benefit while still
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.400]   benefiting the customer, then that is where the value is.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.000]   That's where the value of credit card companies is going to be and where Square is going
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   to be.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.200]   And that's where Foursquare can help bring about.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   It's a huge promotion and when I discovered it I just used my- I've been using it like
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.200]   crazy.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200]   It's five bucks.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200]   It doesn't cost me anything.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   I guess probably Foursquare makes 50 cents or something.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.040]   America Express is probably paying.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.360]   I basically never do things like that.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360]   I don't want to-
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   Me neither!
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.040]   I rarely interact with things like that and that I just happen to love and it's really
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.960]   well done and I'll eat at a restaurant.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.200]   If I see the special, I'm much more likely to go eat there because I like the idea that
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.800]   I could check in and that's going to get a deal.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.600]   That's something I would have been doing otherwise.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.400]   I just thought it was a really good example of mobile advertising.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   My organization, yeah.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.600]   That is really interesting.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.320]   America Express could have spent $20 million on a commercial.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   Instead they divvy up that $5 at a time in happy user experiences that also bring them
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.120]   back benefit in terms of the relationship with the platform Foursquare and with their
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   merchants.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.720]   The merchant says, "Hey, man, people are using their American Express cards.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.400]   This is great."
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.160]   They learn more about you.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.080]   You take the marketing money and put it here.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.920]   That's the future of Facebook if they can friggin figure it out.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.080]   You replace marketing with relationships.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.880]   You've just made my argument before we thank you.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   I'm able to make it.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.920]   Foursquare MX deal is a perfect example of that where it's marketing dollars.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.400]   You look at this, basically they were paying $5 before for you to watch commercials.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.760]   Why don't they pay $5 for you to get low-main and be a happy customer and they know more
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.240]   about you and they've done all these wonderful things so much better?
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.640]   I must debunk an error I made.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.120]   Remember when we talked about this incredible discovery of new Egyptian pyramids in Google
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   Earth?
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   It was my error.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.360]   I put it in the rundown.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.360]   No, no.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   I love the story.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.120]   Fortunately, an Egyptologist reports that now we've known about those since 1925.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.400]   They're not pyramids.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.200]   They're mounds.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.760]   Nothing to see here.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.400]   We appreciate the fact-checking.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.160]   Well, we got to correct it.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:22.280]   Paola Davoli, an Egyptologist at the University of Cilento in your homeland, Gina, says,
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.640]   "The features in Google images have been well-known since 1925 when they were surveyed by G.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.080]   Kate and Thomas Thompson and E.W.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   Gardener.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.120]   They're natural mounds surrounded by a building and by dug wells.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.280]   For sure, they are not pyramids.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.120]   We don't know what they're for."
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120]   Aww.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.040]   While we're talking about corrections, last week we talked about the Twitter API 1.1 changes
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040]   and I gave Twitter a very large benefit of the doubt.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:54.440]   And since that episode, Twitter cut off access to Tumblr, to the social graph, you can no
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.000]   longer find your friends on Twitter.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.840]   They had done this once before with Instagram, but it was kind of easy to write that off
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.440]   because you were like, "Well, Instagram's on my Facebook and there's a little rivalry."
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.120]   No, no, they cut off Tumblr.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.560]   They didn't really have a good reason why.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.440]   That wasn't covered in 1.1 API changes, but I just wanted everyone to be clear that I
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.120]   think it's totally crappy and I'm really disappointed and I'm no longer going to give
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.000]   Twitter as much of the benefit of the doubt as I did last week when we talked about it.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.520]   It doesn't even make sense, frankly.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   No, it doesn't.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   It doesn't.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520]   It does not.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.320]   And Jeff's rant last week about how this is our data.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.440]   I was feeling the outrage.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.040]   I had the Jarvis outrage going on.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:34.200]   I was like, "This is my friend's list that I put together on Twitter and I should be able
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   to export it anywhere to any third party app that I want or to CSV or whatever."
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.960]   It really bugged me that they cut Tumblr off.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.840]   You might want to take something for that feeling when it comes on, Gina.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840]   I don't recall you.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   It's not a good thing.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840]   A meatball.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   Be careful here.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.120]   I generally don't exist in a state of outrage.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   It's just exhausting.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.920]   It's for the really, really angry, angry things and that got me.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.400]   I think that really sucks.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.560]   It's kind of a bummer, isn't it?
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.080]   Well, it goes back to the Samsung Apple discussion.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.680]   We're living and this is business and I know it's business and it's naive to think otherwise.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.080]   But I think a lot of us have a Sesame Street view that Sandhill wrote as Sesame Street
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.960]   and the law where we all want to work together and we're all creating such neat stuff and
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.320]   isn't this wonderful?
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:35.960]   And I think there's a lot more anger going on and fighting and things.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.240]   No, everybody's all anxious and upset.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:45.280]   The Facebook stuff is really confusing because it just hasn't really felt very Twitter-like.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:51.040]   I could see you wanting to say, "Okay, Instagram, you're part of Facebook and we're not getting
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.920]   along with Facebook right now."
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.440]   And I don't know what the status of Facebook shifting data back into Twitter is.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.680]   I know that Facebook hasn't allowed Google to pull data so you could see no loss between
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.840]   the two of those.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.440]   But what happened?
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440]   What's going on with Tumblr?
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.960]   Why did they become enemies and why?
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.560]   It's not even making any money.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.640]   You can't get me to read Ian.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.760]   David Carpster, a great guy and I don't get it.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:20.360]   Well, unless somebody's about to acquire Tumblr and it's not going to be Twitter or there's
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.640]   some other things that are going on there going with it.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.160]   But to what Gina was talking about, I had done this thing earlier this year when the
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:32.760]   whole fight was going on about what Google could or couldn't get from Facebook and could
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.080]   or couldn't get from Twitter and what Twitter was saying you ought to be doing.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.160]   And this is back when the whole Google+ thing was going on and Facebook and Twitter were
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.120]   like, "Well, you're favoring Google+ more than you're favoring us."
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:49.440]   And Google was like, "Well, yeah, we can't get half your data.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.160]   So if you want to start giving us some of this data."
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   And then we'll talk.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.200]   Yeah, and what I did is I wrote this thing called a proposal for social media to taunt.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.280]   But in part of it, you can look it up, but part of it had this thing called the Bill
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.520]   of Social Data Rights.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.360]   And what I was saying is, look, they're a very good piece.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   Thank you.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.560]   Thank you.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.320]   But it was like, you know, anything I post publicly to Twitter or Facebook or Google, that's
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   public.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.080]   You don't get to hold onto it and you don't get to block it from someone else.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.000]   So if Google wants to crawl my Facebook post, Google can crawl unless I've said you can't
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.560]   crawl it, not Facebook says they can't crawl it.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   And interestingly, Facebook apparently just released this, just changed it now so that
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.680]   your private post, we had a thing on, I think, Search Engine Land that looked at this where
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.520]   it looked like that was opening up.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.760]   The other thing was that our profiles, ourselves, what we do, who we're with or whatever, that
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.080]   that sort of metadata that should be able to be included.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.040]   And this goes to what you said, Gina, you know, your friends are yours.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.440]   They're my friends and I should be able to take those friends anywhere I want.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.480]   And I mean, not like the way Facebook does it where, okay, here's a list of names.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.480]   Right?
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.000]   You've never done enough Facebook.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.440]   You go, oh, I export my friends.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.560]   It's like, well, here you are.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   Here's 1200 names.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.040]   You know, it's like to get to take them with my Twitter URLs or all that other stuff.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.480]   And what I said was, what is proprietary to the social network?
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.920]   What is your most valuable data?
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.640]   Is your social shares and your social actions?
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.040]   The interrelationships that we have on your social network between the people we know
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.680]   there, that's yours.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.520]   Okay, we don't need to take that stuff out there.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.080]   That's your secret sauce.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.560]   That's your type of thing.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.720]   You know, you want to do that.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.800]   But the raw ingredients, I should be able to take out.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.120]   They don't belong to you.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.280]   They belong to me, the user.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.680]   We need data liberation for third party data liberation.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.920]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.120]   So tools that, and I'm sort of waiting for these to, and to some extent, I'm building
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.040]   one, tools that help you extract your data from these networks and maybe import it into
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040]   other.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.760]   I mean, it gets complicated because there aren't standards for formats and that kind
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760]   of thing.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.120]   Everybody, you know, the companies that do offer data liberation or export, do it in
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.120]   different formats.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.720]   Facebook gives you a zip of HTML files and Twitter gives you JSON or XML, whatever.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.040]   But I think that this is going to become, you know, a bigger issue.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.520]   And when the tumbler thing happened, I thought, hmm, like, who's going to set up, I think
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.320]   Mark Jake with from WordPress said this.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:16.520]   You know, who's going to set up the pirate export, my friends sites that then, you know,
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.320]   feed into tumbler, you know, using the different APIs, kind of that third party app that's
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.800]   going to plug them into one another.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.080]   But yeah, there's a big need for this.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   But who enforces this?
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.200]   Like, you know, is this a third party organization that's going to enforce this?
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.120]   Are we going to come up with principles of rules and then different social networks,
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   you know, either make them know they don't?
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.120]   You got to get, I think I got to get a H&R gene.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.120]   You got to get mad.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.040]   You got to make barricades.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:48.400]   I think the users could get mad, but I think the big three and I would count as the big
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:55.200]   three being Facebook, Google and Twitter have all been interrelatedly angry at each other
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.680]   that at this point, they sound hypocritical not to support this stuff.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.960]   It was funny when Facebook and Twitter came out with their don't be evil tool to show
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.160]   what Google could have gotten off the public web if they wanted to put stuff into their
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.120]   Google+ boxes for Facebook and Twitter.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.240]   And yet, Twitter looks stupid in the sense that you guys cut off access to Google to
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.240]   crawl your stuff.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.000]   And to this day, we still cannot use Google if we want to to find stuff as well as we
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.800]   can on Twitter.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.640]   You, Twitter don't even have a database that goes back past seven days.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.360]   Finding my own tweets is painful.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   I have to go over to Topsy, which is great.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.080]   They've been the anointed alternative Google and it's great for Topsy or whatever.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.520]   But I'd rather search on Google.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   It's just the two I want to use.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.480]   And I can't do it because you don't want to have a deal with them because we don't know.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   We don't know what it is.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.360]   We don't know if they didn't want to pay you enough or you thought it was too competitive
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.560]   or whatever the deal was.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.080]   We don't necessarily know from Google.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.920]   All we know is you two couldn't make a deal over the ability for Google to index stuff
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.480]   that belongs to us.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.440]   And so your mad as hell we're not going to take it anymore.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   Right.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.200]   But so then when you a year later come around and say, well, Google's not being fair to
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.200]   us.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.040]   It's like, well, what's your problem?
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.800]   Or when Facebook gets upset and they're like, well, Google isn't indexing out of our stuff.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.280]   It's like, okay, we wanted to take our stuff out of Facebook and bring it over into Google
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.880]   and you wouldn't let us do it.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.800]   But we could do it for Yahoo.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800]   What's the point?
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:26.400]   I mean, you're just so I think there's enough hypocrisy all around for the pressure to go
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.280]   on to them to say, you need to stop fighting amongst yourselves.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.360]   You need to pull it together.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.560]   Realistically, I'm not optimistic.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:39.160]   Well, it's funny because Twitter wants it both ways because there's a court battle going
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.240]   on right now in New York state.
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.320]   The New York, the Twitter's a file in the field in the New York Supreme Court saying,
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.600]   are users own their tweets?
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.520]   And that Twitter says that the users have a property right to the content they post and
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.360]   a fourth amendment privacy right to their accounts.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.660]   The deleted tweets are not public and Twitter accounts just have the same protection as
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.680]   personal email accounts.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.120]   All of which is God's work and this is where this one can be a bit Twitter.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120]   That's why I love Twitter.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.800]   But the judge said, by design, Twitter has an open method of communication.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.240]   So this is really kind of an interesting battle in which Twitter, I think you're right, is
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.840]   on the side of the angels is trying to protect us.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.080]   But it's just, I guess it's good when it's convenient for them, we own our tweets.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.480]   Oh, yeah, when it's convenient for them, they own the tweets.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.160]   It just depends on what I would have been that cynical.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160]   I am not cynical now.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.700]   I wouldn't have been that cynical a few weeks ago.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.020]   I would have still wondered where the real Twitter is.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:42.220]   I'm just starting to see the dark side.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:48.020]   In early in 2012, prosecutors asked Twitter for information about a protester during the
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.860]   Occupy Wall Street protest last year.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.380]   Malcolm Harris, Twitter told Harris about the subpoena.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:58.340]   He filed a motion to quash the court denied Harris motion and told Twitter to comply.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.420]   And may Twitter filed a motion to oppose that order.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.000]   In June the court denied Twitter's motion.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.140]   And now in August, Twitter is appealing and filed the motion again.
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:10.740]   The court said in part that the things that are made public are in fact public.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.740]   Public is public.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.740]   I agree with that.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:18.060]   If it's been public and even if you kill it, somebody recorded it somewhere tough.
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.140]   But what they're also going for is more information than that.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140]   They're going for identity.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.380]   They're going for when and where it happened.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.140]   They're going for other data that isn't public.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.820]   And so Twitter is indeed with the right thing.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.860]   But I kind of like this because maybe we can kind of use it on Twitter here.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.500]   It's like, ah, you're right.
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:35.500]   You're right.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.500]   We do own it.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   It is ours.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.740]   So give it to us.
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.460]   Or don't count on Twitter fighting for you for much again.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:48.140]   That might be gone.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.140]   Google, this is just in.
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:56.460]   Google is apparently tapping Barclays Bank to seek buyers for Motorola's set top box
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.460]   business.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.460]   Google of course.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.060]   No sense to me.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.860]   We had some question about what were they going to do?
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.060]   The Google makes kind of make set top boxes.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.340]   Google TV.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.900]   But apparently it doesn't want that.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.940]   It just wanted the smartphone business.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.380]   Both were part of Motorola mobility which Google bought.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.900]   They say it's worth about $2 billion.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:19.900]   All right.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.620]   Well, it's a nice bit of money.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   You can pull back in.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.100]   What they say from Motorola again?
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.100]   12, right?
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.100]   Pull in $2 billion.
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.620]   You don't get all the patents that you wanted.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.940]   You perhaps even keep some of the patents that were associated with it because you sell
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.300]   it and you get a cross licensing type of thing.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.300]   Right.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.980]   I mean, set top boxes.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.940]   I think it's a dead business, isn't it?
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:46.460]   The future of your set top boxes in Apple TV or Roku or maybe a Nexus Q if they ever
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.460]   fix it, right?
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.260]   They're saying it's a dead business, I think.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.260]   Okay, I got it.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.260]   I got it.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.020]   So they will be in the set top box business, but not this way.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.620]   They want to be able to disrupt that business.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.620]   I don't know.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620]   We're going to take a break.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.340]   Come back with your tools and tips and number of the week.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:08.020]   But first a word from our friends at Stamps.com who are disintermediating the post office.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:13.460]   Well, okay, what they're doing is they're letting you print your own US postage right
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.140]   from your computer and printer.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.060]   So you never have to go to the post office again.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.780]   You never have to wait in line.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.700]   You never have to worry about whether you have the right postage.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.620]   You always have the right postage with Stamps.com.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.220]   And with their USB scale, you always know exactly how much postage you need.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.740]   Never pay up any more.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.500]   You'll save money too because you get discounts from Stamps.com.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:38.580]   You can't get it the post office up to 21% on US Postal Service Express mail up to 15%
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.140]   on priority mail.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:44.220]   It saves you a lot of time to a print right on the envelope if you want.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.940]   You can actually, if you're an Amazon or eBay seller, get the information from the buyer's
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.500]   page and it just automatically prints it all out for you.
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.500]   So it really is a great time saver.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.180]   I've got a great deal for you.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.500]   If you visit Stamps.com right now, you'll see there's an $80 offer on the front page.
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.500]   Don't take it.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.700]   I'm telling you it's I've got a better deal.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.660]   Click the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner and you'll see if you enter in
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:14.540]   the offer code TWIG, you can turn that $80 value into a $110 value, including $55 in
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.980]   free postage.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.020]   The digital scale for free.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.780]   You just pay shipping and handling $5 supply kit and a four week trial.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.500]   It really is a great deal.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.500]   Try it now.
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:28.300]   Offer code TWIG at Stamps.com.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:32.340]   Click that microphone and then start printing postage.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.660]   You don't need a postage meter or anything.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.660]   I love it.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:38.900]   Time Gina Trapani for your tip of the week.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:44.100]   Tip of the week, Microsoft SkyDrive, which I admit I haven't used.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.580]   I signed up for a long time ago, but it's seven gigabytes of free cloud storage, similar
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:53.500]   product to Dropbox or Google Drive, but a little more space.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.700]   I think that they're competing on how much space they give you.
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.140]   You get seven gigs.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.900]   Their Android app is now available.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.220]   Just became available this week.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:03.340]   The iOS app and the Windows mobile app had been out for a while.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.100]   So SkyDrive app for Android.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.260]   It's pretty simple for now.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.020]   You can upload multiple photos.
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.220]   You can open documents.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:17.660]   It's got very much very jelly beanie.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:18.660]   Can you hear me still?
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.660]   Yeah, you're back.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.660]   Okay, good.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.060]   That's available for free in the Google Play Store now.
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:28.380]   Like I said, I haven't been using SkyDrive, but it's seven gigabytes of cloud storage.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.380]   So hey, why not?
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.620]   If you haven't looked at it in a while, check it out.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:35.020]   It's good for people using Windows and Mac.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.020]   And Mac.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.020]   Yeah, and Android.
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.700]   Actually, SkyDrive is this kind of unknown and good deal.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.500]   It really is pretty cool.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   It is.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.500]   They offer more storage than Dropbox and Google Drive and quite a few of the others.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:52.020]   So Jeff Jarvis has several numbers to choose from.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.020]   What do you want to pick?
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.580]   Pick a few.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:28:00.540]   We could do Zuckerberg meets the oldest Facebook user Florence Detloor, who's 101 years old.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.220]   That's the number 101.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:07.740]   We could do 18 million, which is how much the Winklevi have paid for a brand new home
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740]   in the Hollywood Hills.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:14.580]   But I won't do that because Citrix is involved in a study looking at the percentages of people
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.020]   who are confused about the cloud.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:19.020]   And is it 100?
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.220]   Well, you know, it's just as wonderful.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.980]   51% of respondents believe that stormy weather can interfere with cloud computing.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.460]   Of course it can.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.460]   51%.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.700]   A majority response is which is not a majority.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:33.780]   29% also think that the cloud is an actual cloud.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.140]   I'm guessing that's what.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.620]   I'm hoping that's a punchline.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:41.220]   It's like those those ways that say, you know, that 98% of Americans think Obama is an alien,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.220]   you know, you know, it's how you ask the question.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.220]   Exactly.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:51.460]   A survey found that 54% of respondents claimed to never use the cloud in their everyday lives,
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:55.620]   but in fact, 95% actually use something powered by the cloud.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.620]   Of course.
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:03.100]   And the majority of the internet 40% majority, but I think I mean, plurality of respondents
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:08.100]   see the major advantage of the cloud being able to work at home in the nude.
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:12.420]   Come on, this is from the onion.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:17.700]   This is if you click on the link there, it's web pro news and it's a company doing something
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.180]   for Citrix.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:24.300]   And I think with some humor involved, I think say Wakefield research.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.900]   They did survey a thousand Americans.
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.900]   They found them in bars.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:31.900]   What's the cloud?
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.820]   It's a little floaty thing up there.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.780]   It looks like a goose.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.060]   My tool of the week is who ha?
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.660]   I just like the name who ha.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.020]   Yeah, you like that, Dave?
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.020]   I like the name who ha used to be jive, but so much better.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.260]   It is the first Android app free for app.net.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:55.660]   And we talked with Dalton Caldwell of app.net.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:59.660]   It's a paid kind of answer to Twitter response to Twitter.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:04.980]   It's not a Twitter clone, but the idea of app.net is that it uses open APIs, Pub/Sub,
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:10.740]   Hubbub and things like that to make it possible for everybody to participate.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:14.380]   You have to pay, though, fifty bucks a year to be a participant.
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.980]   Huha looks strangely like, I don't know, kind of as that Google+ feel to it, but I like
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.980]   it.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.300]   And it's very easy to use and I huha just a moment ago.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.320]   And we've been looking for a new term.
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.520]   You can't say tweet on app.net.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.580]   So I think we might all huha.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.420]   You who or did you ha?
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:34.620]   I ha'd and then I hoo'd.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.300]   I just r-pede you.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.220]   r-p is the new thing.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.500]   r-p is the new thing.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500]   r-t is the r-t for app.net.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500]   The r-t is app.net.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.820]   I don't know what to think about app.net, but at least, you know, what's amazing is
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:52.180]   the developer community has just leapt on it and there's hundreds of clients.
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:57.860]   Seems like maybe dozens of clients and this is the first to, you know, kind of Android
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:02.860]   standalone client and it doesn't feel like it's .6, 0.6, but it doesn't feel alpha.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   It feels very, you know.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.940]   They have, but you know, I got to say there was a little thing that was coming up this
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:10.940]   week where I can't remember who was saying it was like, you know, oh, and developers
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.380]   made Twitter and developers made Twitter and I just sort of like thought, you know what?
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.380]   No.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.380]   No.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.380]   Users made Twitter.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:18.380]   Right.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.220]   And they still make Twitter and developers can make it easy, but if you hadn't developed
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.420]   a single thing for Twitter and it was still a website, there might have been people who
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.380]   still would have taken it up into some other area and maybe they would have just built
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.540]   their own ecosystem.
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:32.980]   So I don't mean to come and comment down on developers, but as an actual tech user type
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.180]   of a person or whatever, our world's not revolving around the development space.
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:39.780]   Well, you got to have users.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.100]   And so, you know, it's great.
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:48.100]   Every developer out there that wants to spend the $100 or $200 or $1000 or whatever it was
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:53.220]   to get on there was, you know, you can go on it, but I don't need an app.net.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.580]   So developers have a better place to develop.
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:32:01.380]   I need an app.net because it's a better place for me to do the things that I cannot do as
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.180]   well on other services, which this is aimed at Twitter, obviously.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:08.660]   So if you've got something that's better for me, then Twitter has great.
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:11.180]   Right now, you don't got anything that's better than me than Twitter.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.860]   I can't shorten URLs.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.420]   I can't share photos.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.260]   It's not a very pleasant experience, but you know, I'll keep playing with it.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.260]   I like it.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.500]   It's nice smart people in there.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   That's why I use it.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500]   But you're right.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.300]   It doesn't have critical mass by any means.
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:28.620]   So it's not you can't like if I wanted to know if somebody died, I can't go to app.net.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:29.620]   I have to go to Twitter.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:33.020]   So you know, I don't know if you're a user.
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.940]   But I don't know if you're a user.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.900]   I don't know if you're a user.
