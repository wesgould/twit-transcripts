[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.840]   Gina, Japan is on assignment. So we begin the new year with
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.600]   You know, I don't want to call him the second string because I love both these guys Kevin Marks is here
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   Kevin's worked everywhere including the Google
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.560]   Including the Apple currently working at Salesforce, right? That's right and
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   British Telecom before that he does a great show
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   Called Tamil vision have you guys come back or you are off your hiatus?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.480]   We're basically still looking around for a producer to help us out with that because we realized that we're not producers
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.080]   We're we're gonna try and revive it this year. Yes. There's been it's been quiet since March is don't tell Chad
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.840]   But a good producer is worth his weight in gold. Yeah
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.440]   Chas not here. He's a vacation actually Carson body who's I've worked with since
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.560]   ZD TV since the site on NBC is produced this show and he's a great producer to don't help him
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.840]   Don't tell him that also hear from tech crunch true all enough great to see you good. See you sir in person
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.360]   I love that here in beautiful. We are just very happy today to have you both happy new year happy new year to you both
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   What you do for New Year's Eve?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.160]   We played cards against humanity and played Nintendo. I'm amazed and how many people played cards against humanity
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.320]   I never played it's amazing. It's
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.200]   Somebody played it on the show
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.720]   Late night on on the on the network and we heard a little bit about it later. Whoops
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.640]   Have you ever played that Kevin?
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.400]   I have played it once or twice. Yes, it was a big thing at XO XO conference
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.160]   They were just gnarly sponsors a bit or something. It's like it's a card game, but you're doing horrible things
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.600]   You're saying horrible. You're trying to say horrible things. Yes. Yeah, you're not actually doing a nasty sentence
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.300]   I could buy by basically doing mad lives with what you've got in fact
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.080]   They call it a card game for horrible people. Yes
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.360]   But the nice part about its open source you can download you can download the cards and then
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.620]   You know print out whatever you want. Wow make your own. I'm so tempted to pick up a we need to do a twit
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.960]   No, we know no, we don't we did it and
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   I got the emails
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.600]   Not nice
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.920]   Because it's it is horrendous. No, no, no, we could do a twit set of cards. Oh, it are nice
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.760]   That makes to do has to do with your show. Yes, that would be fun. They end it would be nice. Yeah, maybe the open source them
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.800]   So, you know normally I don't like doing shows on January 2nd because what could possibly have happened over the past
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.360]   Year, but there are a few things for instance this morning. Ava said we're gonna buy zip car
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.600]   That's interesting for half a billion dollars
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.400]   Zip car is in San Francisco. Have you ever used it? Yes, I have so the idea is they're just sitting there in special
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.040]   Parking spaces you have a card on account with them, right? Absolutely. It's a pure thing and you're topping a car
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.080]   And where do you get the key? They they leave them in they have a thing where he a dongle just pop the dongle pops out
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.640]   It's it's quite amazing and it actually leaves open a hole now now that Ava's has them
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   Well, that's what it gets step up frankly scares me because I think I wonder if Ava's bought them
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.440]   To put them out of business because it's got to undermine their stand their traditional rental indeed car business Kevin
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.280]   You have any have you ever used this? I haven't used it car. No, no
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.360]   I'm a lot of people come up here use it car to come up here because we have a lot of San Francisco
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   Correspondents who don't have cars indeed. Yes, we don't need them don't eat them
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.280]   Yeah, well even sometimes they so I need cars, but I mean San Francisco is a bicycle right?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.480]   Well, that's funny because in Paris and many other European cities. They have zip car only its bikes
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.940]   Is it bikes? Yeah, well London has those yeah, it's great
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.880]   You just pretty good you rent a bike. They're not great bikes within a horrible bike
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.000]   And you can go anywhere and you just it goes as a special they have a special locking bike rack and get leave it
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.480]   Don't worry about it. So of course now
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.960]   inevitably
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.120]   The securities litigation firm of powers Taylor along with Willie Brisco the ex-us sec attorney have announced they will be investigating
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.240]   The zip car sale and possibly following a lawsuit to block the deal
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.720]   turns out
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.160]   That at 500 million dollars. That's only twelve dollars twenty five cents per share
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.240]   Which is below their 52 week. I have 16 25
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.480]   You know sold a little cheap there then you know was the trading at the moment? Well, that's a good question
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.680]   I think it's I think it's I think it's a $12.20. So they're paying a nickel premium
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.340]   Seems to me that's the established going price. That's what people are paying on the stock market
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.000]   You want them to pay a premium? It's closing price on December was eight dollars 24. Well, there you go
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.480]   Right and the deal's probably been in the nights at 12 20
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.520]   This is one of those things where they're probably trying to squeeze a little more money out of Davis. Well, there's always gonna be litigation
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.680]   There's litigation for litigation. You're right
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.320]   You're right if you're a zip car stockholder you can join the class action
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   Car stockholders you should be happy because you never know what could happen and I would take the half a billion
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.320]   Run with it drive with it drive with it drive away fast
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   But from a point of view of users
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.600]   I think it's a little scary because I hope that Davis keeps this business
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.080]   So maybe they see this is as a as a part and part of their portfolio of rental cars, right?
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.280]   And don't kill it
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.360]   Well, I mean they're gonna have to run it as a as a separate entity
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.560]   I mean once they start mixing the two then we know how that goes goes away line start getting crossed and forgetting right
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.720]   It's blurred. It's going and then it's just same thing zip car becomes the Avis Bureau in the admission street
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.320]   This is a cheaper version of an Avis right car
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.520]   Anyway, I thought that was an interesting story, so thanks for joining us and oh go ahead Kevin
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.940]   Compare to get around the ones where you're actually renting your own car out
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.760]   Let those seem more interesting to me well, they're interesting only because the mind reels with the possibilities
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.480]   You have an extra car. It's lying around you're not using it today. Somebody can just borrow it
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.040]   Well the logical one for me makes sense is
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:32.360]   trains and train car parks and airport car parks because that's where you got two weeks and that would be a direct
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.960]   It's just sitting there great idea. It's a great idea until somebody runs it
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.480]   That's true like the Airbnb for cars. Yeah, so that's this one
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.560]   Yes, it's all get around us, but they you've got to work out where to pick it up
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.280]   Whereas the you know the airport car park for me is like I'm paying them for 15 bucks a day while I'm like our sits there
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.240]   It'll be nice to someone rendered for a week few days while I'm away
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.020]   And you know it would be at the airport reminds me that episode of
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.720]   Seinfeld with George Costanza found a very cheap parking lot turned out they were using his car to turn tricks
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.360]   There you go kind of using it while you're not using it, right?
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.560]   Well, this is the self-driving part of the theory the self-driving car, isn't it is that?
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.880]   We spend all this time
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   Pay all this money to have these cars sitting around most the time just so that they when we need them right
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.480]   And zip car is one answer that and get around another but the self-driving car thing is say
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.280]   Oh, I need a car and the car drives around to a house and picks you up
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   And also when you go somewhere you don't need a pocket you just get out the car and it goes and look somewhere else
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.480]   It comes back when you want it so that that's you know
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.200]   That's one of the obvious things you can do with a self-driving car once you've got that
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   But the other thing is you can do the same kind of
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   car sharing thing where you just say okay, I
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.480]   You know I have an interest in a pool of cars in this neighborhood and when one you know
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.520]   I need one little turn up and it'll go away and so you can use fewer cars and you know if you have fewer parking spaces
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   so there's a whole bunch of sort of
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.040]   interesting things that become possible once you can
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:03.880]   Arbitrage these things between people because the transaction cost goes down in a bargain new car is this enormous transaction getting a
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:11.040]   Even renting car is fairly painful, but these things are sort of converging on that that easiness of this is where they're when I need it
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.360]   But you need some you know at the moment
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.080]   The rental comments will bring a car to you, but that means they're gonna have two drivers to deal with it for it
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.760]   Right two cars have to come out now
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.200]   That's everybody talks about Thomas vehicles the people who are doing this research and stuff
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.640]   That's what they really say is it's the end of car ownership
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.240]   Yeah, and car and it makes sense because a car is such a huge consumable
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.440]   There's only used a small percentage of the total time. It's a huge drain on the environment
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:42.320]   Correct, why should we build a car per person or two cars in some cases per people when you could have one car serve ten people
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.920]   Just as a much more efficiently and effectively yeah collaborative consumption
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.240]   I love the big buzzword right now because you're seeing things like air B&B and all that you just had a house that you can't be at
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.600]   But you could make money off of it. How do you convince?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.440]   And maybe it's an American illness
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.000]   Or or a first world illness. How do you convince people that it's better not to own?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.600]   Well, I mean I want to own stuff don't they I mean they don't like to rent
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.920]   Right, this is what is so what do you get um?
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   I saw somebody give a give a
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.320]   Ignite talk about this a couple years ago and they said actually this is less true if you look at the really rich people
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.520]   They just rent stuff. Oh, that's true at least that they lease they lease apartments. They lease, you know
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.280]   Oh, they say they you know, they do lease to bar. I
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.520]   And you know partly there's their attacks games that means you can do as a company
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.760]   But it means you've got option value means you can say okay
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.920]   I don't have this commitment of this giant house and this to maintain in this car
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920]   I've got a take to the shop and
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.200]   You know all the sort of little niggly things a ownership actually if you got enough money you it's easy to rent stuff
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.960]   And the trade off you know that that transition has been you know, cranchily happening is it because we'd used to be the way around
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.200]   It used to be if you were rich you had land right and other people paid you rent
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:01.240]   You know they had a rentier class who owned the property into that but now there's you know a financial class that
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.600]   Actually spends all their time renting and stuff doesn't own much. That's probably chiefly for tax reasons
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.320]   Because they get bored with things, but it is really adds your flexibility. They said that one of the reasons Detroit went downhill so fast
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.640]   After the most recent economic crisis was that everybody was upside down in their houses
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.960]   And so it just because they were all subprime loans
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.200]   So it just made a lot of more sense just to walk away
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   And and and just leave them there and the banks didn't want them
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.040]   So it just and they and actually the same piece suggested that if you're young you're smart
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:40.560]   You do not buy you rent because the problem is you need to be able to go to where the jobs are when there were no jobs in Detroit
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.440]   Exactly owning was a bad thing if you'd been renting you just pick up stakes and you move on
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   You got to go where the where the resources are so it does make sense
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.920]   I guess I think it starts catching on once people
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.640]   Figure out that they could take that money and put it elsewhere
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   So if the American dream is to own a house
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.560]   Why own a car when you could just save that money put it aside
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:06.480]   Who's gonna be who's gonna start making this sexy and appealing? I guess if cars done a lot to that clearly
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   Airbnb Airbnb
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.800]   Definitely has yeah, there's a but there's still people who are afraid of the idea
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.560]   They're like I wouldn't want my house other people living in it
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.480]   But once they do it and the money comes in or like well that was great
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.720]   Is this why the adventure capital community was so excited by Airbnb Kevin they really I thought at the time
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.160]   You know people were I can't remember who it was but they people
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.840]   The VCs were saying oh this is gonna disintermediate everything. This is gonna change everything. I thought wait a minute
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.920]   It's just it's a vacation exchange is not
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.400]   Well, I think well actually took them a while to catch onto Airbnb
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   There's a lot of if you actually listen a lot of them turn it down
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.320]   Fools they are they were saying oh who would do who would do that?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.600]   Yeah, but yeah, I suppose the other thing is is VCs are in the class of people who have two homes, right?
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.320]   So they're used to either renting them or they get it have all that and so for them
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.920]   It's like you mean you could be the managing agent from from my Tahoe College
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.000]   Oh, you know, there's there's they understand that that aspect of it
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.920]   But the other and you know the other aspect is when you're traveling you want you want to stay somewhere now
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.000]   You know if you're a business traveler and your employers paying your stay in a hurry over the full service thing
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But you know my last trip to the UK
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.080]   was a flying physics my son was had a college interview and
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.480]   My mom and sister wanted to meet up with us while we were there and we looked at it
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.560]   It was actually a lot easier and cheaper to rent and a fly
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.500]   That sleeps for an Airbnb. They're actually getting off hotel room to cover it in London
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:39.040]   So and you know and it was straightforward to do so that that in for for me that was like
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.000]   Oh, there's a there's a crossover point here where this makes a lot of sense
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.600]   It's a mindset of utility - I think I mean nobody gets any in their homes. They don't get internet hardwired, right?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.960]   You rent you have a line that comes in and you have a cable modem and you can you don't want it you can get rid of it
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.240]   And the same thing with a car drive a car for a week don't like it try a different car
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.360]   You may be it's your generation because you know I see the co-working spaces in San Francisco people don't have offices
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   Cheers, they get they rent time in an office
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.400]   They rent as receptionist they rent off and they don't and they're and it is important to be flexible
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:19.520]   Why be tied to something right you know and if you really like a space then you can stay there figure out how to get a space just like it
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.920]   I'm of the older
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.800]   Post-war baby boom generation. We all wanted our little Levittown
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.440]   houses and
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.080]   Our little piece of the piece of the world just takes us longer to realize what we really want
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.920]   And I look at people like like you and Kevin Rose who were just mobile liquid
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.280]   Moving around it scares my parents
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.400]   Kevin it's like I don't
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.000]   Have a job for life and you get a gold watch and you have a house with a cottage and the picket fence and that right?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.560]   Well, no
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.280]   I'm not necessarily the representation of that generation
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.440]   that's true, but you know the the the thing of being able to change jobs and having that flexibility is important
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.840]   but also the other thing is a lot of this is
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:16.480]   It is about you know complexity of transactions the reason we had offices was that's where the infrastructure was you had
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.880]   your desk and you had your colleagues in the meeting rooms and the telephone system and the computers and
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.760]   You know all this infrastructure and you know a mail room and stuff, you know
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.400]   There was a place there because that was what you needed to do business
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.480]   And the challenge now is that you know and there was a separate realm
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   It was also I can give you my business car because that's a business card
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.480]   It doesn't have my home phone number on it. Whereas now my phones in my pocket my laptops
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.560]   You know here my tablet, you know, I can do business anywhere I do I work from here most of the time
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.760]   I'm going to San Francisco. I need to
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.760]   and
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   There are a lot of people who no longer need that that office space
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.760]   We're able to not have to spend two hours a day going up and down to
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.400]   You know somewhere else because that's where the that's where the office is. Yeah overhead is scary
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.840]   We're gonna talk about any board them and jaded
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.120]   this next
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:14.360]   Seems like the entire tech pundit community from Mike Harrington on down is just bored
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.680]   With the whole thing topic. Yeah, why is every Brian blocks as I'm quitting Instagram?
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.320]   Tech crunch founder Mike Harrington says I'm bored. It's boring. Is it really boring?

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.600]   It's the first month of the year twig one. That's it twig one
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.640]   squarespace
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.080]   Dot-com the best way to create a high quality website blog or online portfolio
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.060]   We all know my character. We know Mike likes to stir things up
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.960]   See just you come around the office. We say I mean, you know crunch crunch fund has a small office within our office
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.000]   We say once in a while still writes for tech crunch
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.080]   But because he became a venture capitalist he and MG and others have kind of pulled back a little bit from the daily report
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.280]   Oh, indeed indeed Mike though on the last day of the year posted I'm bored
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:39.040]   What's next it's about 2013 I say I'm a little bored the blogger in me is he says in an invest as an investor things are peachy
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   But as a consumer and observer of tech things feel like 2002 to me a lot of belt tightening
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.880]   Yeah, mobile. Yeah, I get it everything's mobile this days. Let's go mobile
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   But really that's just an IQ test
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:01.200]   When you see bold new starters with nothing but a desktop strategy, you know, they don't get it. You can go nice kid
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.400]   I'll see you later
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.680]   But he says most of the mobile stuff is just radioactive decay from the iPhone launch in 2007
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.280]   Now you could I don't you know, I don't know if that's fair
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:20.560]   You could also say the other way the iPhone began something that was a transformation and is just now kind of getting in gear
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.720]   I don't think it's decay. I think it's the opposite
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.120]   I'm not gonna ask you to attack Mike Harrington. Oh, I disagree with them wholeheartedly. Thank you
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.080]   But I think you make some really good points. God. Well, there's and then Ryan Bloch says I'm out of here
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.360]   I killed my Facebook now. I'm killing Instagram
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.280]   I know the terms of services are alright. I just don't like it and then
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.440]   Interesting point, but his his point was
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.800]   I've just realized that I don't actually use it anything
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.320]   Yeah, and I have all these vestigial accounts on these different services
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   I only realize it when they get sold to someone else and start spamming me and that's a good point
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.680]   My colleague JP was saying this day said
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.260]   Is there a way of keeping track of all the absolute elite from your phone because that will be really useful information
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.280]   It's like right friends deleted this week. I know Apple used to make you review them
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.200]   Ask you to review them as you delete them. They stopped doing next as if I don't
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.100]   It's got really sad about it, but it is it is this signal
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:21.360]   It's like you know, I got a I got a reminder from Plankso yesterday's saying me a swag so send an e-card to Wow
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.600]   It's like there's a talk about us
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:31.160]   Wow flashback that that really is 2002
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.760]   Right, you know, it's like there's this sort of weird thing where
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.120]   You know Tim but Tim Berners Lee says eventually your websites turn into porn sites
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   But I think there's this sort of intermediate stage where all these sites turn into spammers and send you emails to tell you about other people's birthdays
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.800]   It's like yeah
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.120]   Why are you reminding about this but other people's birthdays?
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:56.920]   Yeah, so on the one hand you could I mean it really is glass half empty half full you could say that we're in an amazing creative
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.160]   Renaissance with a thousand ideas
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:08.840]   germinating many of them crap, but who cares because there's many others that are great or you could say ah board
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.320]   I've seen it all before when is something gonna do something a
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:18.080]   Completely new and innovative, you know, you're always waiting in technology for the big paradigm sure I think my I think
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.960]   The point of that article was to smack some people around and go hey wake up, you know
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   We're entering a new year like right look when Instagram was bought by Facebook being a tech blogger
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.520]   My inbox was full of you should check out our photo share
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:36.040]   Now that Instagram is gone because Facebook bought it's like no, they're not gone. They're fine
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.920]   You should check this out and this is the next big thing that is boring
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.520]   Yeah, very boring and annoying after a while
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.400]   So I mean, you know Mike goes over the top that's his deal
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:53.120]   But I think this year if people get involved in different areas like health care education like more niche stuff
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.280]   We say this every year. Let's be more niche. It's true
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.760]   It's like don't give me a photo sharing app give me a photo sharing app that helps my life in this way
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.360]   Like let's think about consumers and stop thinking about like the tech
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.160]   Circle where you think you'll get on tech crunch if you build this, right? It's boring
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.640]   Well, but it's I mean, you know, then
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.840]   You've had you've had apps that disrupt the wind disrupt that do those kinds of things
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.040]   You know, it's not like that the only thing you cover but the challenge is that
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.240]   Part of this is that it's so much easier to make things now, right?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   It's true you you can throw these things together fairly quickly
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.900]   And so I imagine that you know, they go oh, I've just put this thing and then they then they email everyone at tech crunchy
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   I have this thing you let you and so
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.320]   Nice, are we and there's also I think a social overload that we are all experiencing a little bit
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.400]   And maybe those of us on the in the in the punditry field experience it more than others
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.480]   But people are tired the Facebook Twitter. I'm hearing it from more
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.820]   Normals as we call them some folks that aren't in tech we tried to we tried to do it all
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.660]   We tried to post on Google+ and Facebook Twitter and we're exhausted
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:09.400]   We're older we have you know, we're trying to start families and but I think we're what we've realized finally was if I put
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.620]   Something into this meaning my time and my effort in my content
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.120]   What am I getting in return?
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.640]   And I think people are starting to go when am I getting out of Facebook?
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.960]   Right I spend two hours a day on it. What am I doing? And what am I getting getting clear what Facebook's getting out of it?
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.560]   It's clear what's Facebook didn't you love the the story that Randy Zuckerberg got all upset?
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.240]   Yes, so she's Mark Zuckerberg's sister
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:40.000]   She posted on her private Facebook page a picture of the Zuckerberg family poking each other or something right at the kitchen and
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.160]   Using the app is in the app Christmas
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.520]   And then a woman who is her friend no no it was a friend of her sister so yes
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.440]   This is Facebook privacy, right? So it's she had her photos set to
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.200]   Friends of those who are tagged could see the photos. Sorry. That's normal
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:05.320]   Sure, it's the default the default so the friend of the of the sister who was tagged saw the picture
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.120]   There's no way of looking at and saying oh, that's private
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   So she tweeted it cute pictures. There were these there were these tiny little icons
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.560]   Right. Oh, so there is a way to see it is a way to see it. You can look at it say oh that was
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.680]   And they are gray and one of them is a globe and one of them is kind of three people if you like squinted them
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.120]   The story is this woman this this gal who tweeted it had 40,000 followers and worked at
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.840]   Vox media or something was like a marketer so like so the word went out
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.600]   But yeah
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.880]   So I think the wrong word that got used in this was private because nothing on the Internet's private right and Randy Zuckerberg of all
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.720]   People should kind of know that yes her here and it's I the irony and we're all just delicious
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.400]   It's delicious irony is that the sister of the creator of Facebook is apparently unclear about how all this works, too
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:59.640]   Right. Well now I I posted about it and it was basically there there is a difference between private and personal
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.700]   And I don't know how personal has this place on the Internet probably doesn't but
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.540]   You put it online. It's gonna go places. I just tell everybody
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.400]   It's too complicated to know yes, and if you're putting it online people are gonna see it gone
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.040]   Or there's always that potential absolutely
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.200]   Yeah, that was like during I was like everything was boring and then all of a sudden
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.760]   You wake up in the morning my fiance's mother was like the Zuckerberg's were on TV
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:37.080]   So this is Christmas so so I just stuck a link to the icons in the chat room
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.560]   There you go, so have a look at those look so you can obviously tell by looking at these two
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   I
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:53.160]   Mean and the one that left means that only some people can see it. Yeah, I get that
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.920]   Wait if I make it really small is it easier? No, no, no
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:05.020]   3 10 pixel square and they are great. Oh my goodness. There you go. We should give this as a
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:10.160]   That's what they do digital Roar Jacques test. What does this mean?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.120]   Hold on. Let me cover my left eye. I think it means we're having cracked crab for dinner. Oh, wait, that's interesting
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.560]   Yeah, I don't know what that good nice job Kevin. Yeah, that was quick very quick
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.840]   How'd you do that?
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   She's got a cute up
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.680]   I was funny of my stream, but you know that's but that's the point the point is right
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.920]   These things are hard to explain but also they're not actually trying that hard to something
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   You know that they're doing better than they were
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.280]   When you sign up for a Facebook app now, it actually gives you some options about whether it how who can see what it shares
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.960]   So when I said I have to build a person your behalf is like well, yeah, but only I get to see you them
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.360]   Thank you until I trust you so there's there's a set of
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:55.040]   There's a set of nuances around these permissions that are actually quite hard to explain to people and the first iteration of this
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.720]   We were trying you know when we would inventing this stuff collectively
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.640]   We were trying to replace
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:08.000]   Give me your your username and your password to the other service so I can pretend to be you right and let's give me some other
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.240]   permissions so the first iteration of that was it had to be at least as easy as that and if we gave you a page full of
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:18.120]   Choices people just back. This is why I like to call circles. It's just easy to figure out
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.960]   You just it's not that easy when you started communities blew it out of the water
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.320]   It's like what am I why am I yeah? Well, I'm getting messages. I who are keys did blow things up
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.880]   Yes Google does that all the time. I don't it's not so much a privacy thing
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.840]   I think Google learned from buzz what not to do in that regard
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.980]   But it's it's an overflow of information last time we were on it was when scoble blew up about events
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.980]   Yeah, that video where he is curse and it's got invited to every event I
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:51.600]   May I immediately made those changes to my sex. I wouldn't get that stuff all right, so there's a go ahead
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.640]   It's the other day. I'm we were having a microphone at meet up in San Francisco
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.180]   You had a little a little anniversary dinner. We have these we have these dinners every every
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.000]   And you know, there's usually like ten of us turn up
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.280]   But we try to tell a lot of people about the second turn up they want to and it's you know
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.480]   We sit and eat food and geek out about about web standards. It's nice. Not everyone's cup of tea
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.080]   So I try so I thought okay
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.000]   I will publish on the my formats thing
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.320]   I do it on Facebook
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.960]   I do it on Google plus and the problem is on both of them
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.200]   It's really hard to say I want to invite people who are within 50 miles of this event, right?
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.560]   You know, I don't mind, you know, I should like to invite my friends in London. They're not gonna fly out for this
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.560]   It's just a bunch of us. I'm doing it
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.240]   And so on Facebook I went through every single person in the list was like they hear that
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.640]   You know, I don't think all prices are oh, I've got groups here and they're smart about targeting
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.840]   So if I just add my geeky friends group and my microphone rights group
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.120]   Then it'll it'll only show them if it's nearby because it knows what I am that's nice now
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.680]   No, it doesn't it doesn't at all no
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.000]   I got 16 pages of yes, you would think it would do that. It does thanks the invitation, but I'm in London or
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.040]   Conversation oh great. I'm doing something else but I'll come along later on then we eventually realized he was in New York
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.480]   And thought I was in New York and having an event there because no
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.360]   Nast confusion
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:13.280]   So you know straightforward feature requests to both of them when I'm inviting people give me a draw a circle around this thing
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.080]   And tell and show me which people are within this distance
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   And you know ideally now, but even just home location would be it would be enough
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.800]   So I've had this one before you know I got a trip to New York, London
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.280]   I said great
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.120]   I'd like to see who else is around and get together with people and I've got to the same thing of hi
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.800]   I'm in New York
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.600]   I have to say everyone hi I'm in New York come to dinner
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.440]   And then I've got a call in New York restaurant say well
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.880]   I've got somewhere between one and fifty people coming to dinner because I don't know who's coming
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.520]   Or you've got to sit there and my individually poke everyone go are you around?
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.360]   So it's an actual understanding of geography will be really nice for these things
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.440]   I just saw them all things D says
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:56.320]   There's no YouTube app for a Windows phone Microsoft's response is it's not our fault Google is
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.480]   Preventing us from building a YouTube app
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:05.080]   For Windows phone Microsoft VP and deputy deputy general counsel Dave Heiner
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:12.160]   wrote a long post this morning about YouTube's lack of support for its mobile platform and how that affects its users
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.600]   Microsoft says we've been trying for years to get a YouTube app working
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   and and we can't
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.120]   because I
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.760]   Thought so this is probably when it's fun. Sorry. Okay. Yeah. Well. Yeah
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.200]   Google of course made a good one for Apple
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.600]   This has replaced the old one
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:42.640]   Yeah, the I'd say it's very nice Android has good YouTube support why why they wouldn't want Windows phone to have it
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   I don't know
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.660]   Well, I mean for they've they've they've they've to take is
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.520]   Marcus too small we and it worked the web version works, you know that
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.640]   This is a platform started to change for them
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.360]   Because that you know
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.660]   They used to spend a lot of time building mobile apps for all different things and there was a huge mobile team in London
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.400]   Building BlackBerry apps and all the other random things and now they say okay. We have Android
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.760]   That's a lot of phones as iOS. That's a lot of phones the others, you know, well, maybe
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.320]   Yeah, what does it say about Microsoft Google according to Microsoft this Microsoft Council?
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.120]   Last month we this is a quote we learned from YouTube that senior executives at Google
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:28.320]   Told YouTube not to enable a first-class YouTube experience on Windows phones
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.800]   What does that mean well first class being an app as opposed to what they would have this was a blog post
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.840]   Am I yourself? Yeah by their general counsel who I don't think is gonna make stuff up because he's a lawyer
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.940]   He understands no, but he's I don't know why he's blogging about it. He is
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.520]   It's in their public policy blog
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.680]   Oh, I know why because he wants government intervention
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:54.500]   Government and invent look I wouldn't build an app for Windows phone right now. It's just look
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:00.100]   Saying I won't go to that from when this firm even if Microsoft pay me to it's not
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.840]   Well, Microsoft is paying people to build
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.240]   And they still won't do it. Yeah, Google's response contrary to Microsoft's claims
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.320]   It's easy for consumers to view YouTube videos on Windows phones
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.760]   Using our HTML5 based mobile website including viewing high quality video streams in other words
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.040]   We're not we've worked for micro with Microsoft for several years to help build a great YouTube experience at Windows phones
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.280]   In other words, we're not gonna write an app. We don't need to there's a web
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:31.200]   Yeah, I mean, it's heavy-handed, but so what well Google Google has not it's interesting how Google has
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.840]   Shifted a little bit is willing to be a little bit more heavy-handed especially with Microsoft turning off
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   support for EAS for us
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.320]   Well, hey if Windows phone was selling off the shelves
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.440]   I think they would build an app like if there was a bunch of users and they were getting a lot of requests saying we want this
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.320]   I think they would build it well in the holiday week
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.000]   According to a flurry, which is an app analytics platform
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.240]   Android and iOS device activations increased 150% combined 50 million
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.760]   No, see when Microsoft selling maybe a thousand ten thousand five five hundred thousand even 50 million
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:18.440]   Yeah a week. Yeah, I would wrap if I'm a company. I'm focusing on iOS and Android
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.400]   20 million devices this time last year
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:28.440]   Yeah, the other thing is you do the web version because that work on and everything it always works
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.000]   And yeah, okay, you may say I want to build I was first one of the Android first been what you're making and who your target is
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:41.040]   But you do you build a web version as well unless you're particularly silly who else doesn't have a Windows phone app does Instagram have a Windows phone app?
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.920]   No, nobody does exactly so what yeah
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.360]   Facebook doesn't even have a Windows phone. Why is yes, I don't know see that's how much I know
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.560]   So there are lawyers writing a blog post about it, you know what?
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.080]   No, I won't even get into it, but it isn't any competitive
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.840]   I mean if you put that together with turning off EAS. Oh no kicking out Google Maps
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.080]   From iOS that was it was that anything?
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   Sure, there's no Google Maps on Windows
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:16.560]   But that was you know, that's the legacy of a different fight, right that was the
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.720]   Several years ago
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.920]   I remember exactly when it was shortly after I left Google so we must have been around 2008
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:31.200]   Google wanted to build apps for iOS and Apple wouldn't let them and they wouldn't let them build Google voice
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.960]   And they wouldn't build a lot of it and there was a fight about it and went to the FCC and blah blah blah and after that
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.200]   Google like well, I'm not sure why we're paying all these iOS engineers to build stuff
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.520]   We can't ship let's make sure we put the Android one first because at least we know we can ship that right
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.040]   and
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.240]   you know and the maps you know when
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.840]   You know the other thing that just in this sort of
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:57.000]   Because about the other thing when the the iPhone launched it didn't have any way of doing apps and they see where Apple or we built web stuff
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.400]   Right and so Apple had built the Google Maps the YouTube and all these things that they felt they had to be there for it to
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   To be a first-class thing
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.360]   But you know they were doing the UI and they were calling the Google APIs
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.940]   So is this you know part of the argument between Apple and Google was
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:17.600]   Google isn't providing APIs for the bits of maps that we want to do like turn-by-turn and stuff
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.520]   Which they're there provide which they've built in the Android app
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.840]   And you know Google has now made an iOS app that does that so is what Microsoft really saying is YouTube isn't providing
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.560]   Is good enough API hooks do the things that they're doing in their other app?
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:37.400]   Well, you know what they really want is they want the government to intervene and say no
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   We have to have it even you've a plague field is every Microsoft application on Android did they make Android apps?
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.800]   Can I get like no actually the
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.920]   In fact there are Microsoft applications that are even on Windows phone the photosynth for instance which is on iOS
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.720]   Is not available there you go case case closed
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.360]   themselves
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   17
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:06.080]   17.4 million iOS and Android devices were activated on Christmas Day
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:13.000]   So I want to see the so that the developer dashboards link, you know, yeah, let me show you just put this in the
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.280]   Move it still says December 3rd
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.560]   So we should keep an eye on this and see what when they update this so what so what is this this is in the last 14
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.720]   days
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:29.200]   How how many devices in what OS's have accessed Google Play cupcake through jelly be supposed to be but it says
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.260]   They haven't updated not updates since December the third let's let's ask let's get them to do that
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.280]   I find out that because it's good
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.320]   I want to see that you know what that chart does ever Christmas because that would be interesting
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:44.000]   Let's find out now. We'll get into that. You know it figured out particularly for web developers because you know
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.280]   The people who are on ginger boy and less have still got still got the bad browser either you cannot install Chrome on that right
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   So half of and you know 60% amount when he's according to this can't be running of a browser is actually caught up with the worst of the world
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.440]   Do you credit the rumors also reported on tech crunch by Mike butcher?
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.600]   And I think by the Wall Street Journal that and others
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.960]   That Apple might be buying ways. I don't buy that
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.160]   I don't buy it either, but Apple's got to do something
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.960]   I mean look Apple wants to make its map solution really good and it wasn't neither neither
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   Neither sign is commenting, but tech crunch says another source confirms negotiations between Apple and ways are advanced
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.760]   Ways want seven hundred fifty million dollars good for them apples willing to do four hundred million plus another
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.160]   hundred million incentives
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.120]   Ways had less than a million in revenue last year. So the mistake is you don't want any revenue
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.040]   That's how Instagram got a billion dollars because if you have revenue then you've got a multiple of that revenue
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.040]   In this case you have existing contracts that you have to deal with right when you purchase somebody obviously
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.720]   Ways I mean ways this power is love ways maps right love ways
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.400]   It's one of the advantage ways has over Apple Maps and even over what you know
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.480]   It will give Apple a jump up over Google and Nokia is that ways is basically all crowdsource
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.000]   So it's what you're it's watching your car drive around and that's how it knows where stuff is
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.520]   Right, which is the stuff that Google Maps does but ways is also explicitly lets you mark stuff on the map and say there's a radar
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.400]   You know, trampia, right? It's a little more real time than Google Maps. I bet you
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:21.680]   Maybe not. I don't know. Maybe not maybe a little bit more, but maybe not as comprehensive as far as coverage
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.760]   Oh, yeah, there's no places. There's no POI stuff
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:31.440]   Hey, but hey, but they buy him if they buy him then obviously that changes quickly because everybody's gone off big story
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.120]   Probably buried the lead Ubuntu
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.600]   Is announcing canonical the makers of Ubuntu mark shuttleworths company that has really done a good job
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   I think of commercializing Linux
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:48.760]   It says we're gonna do a phone OS first devices will ship early 2014 bravo
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   Bravo some people were thinking because from the the teaser from the last few days is it would be a touch interface to
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.960]   Ubuntu but no, it's a mobile version of in Ubuntu built around
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.600]   The existing Android kernel, which is Linux yes and drivers, but
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.400]   Doesn't use a Java virtual machine
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.540]   Hmm
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.520]   Now Vic which is the virtual machine that Android uses is a Google creation
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.680]   And of course remember Sun was a little
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.840]   Ticked about this is an issue a kerfuffle saying this is not fairly careful not to call it a Java virtual machine
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.480]   Yeah, yeah, because they didn't want to believe it's not Java. Yeah
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.200]   It's something
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.120]   It's pretty much compatible with the Java VM but
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.320]   Well, and that's what Sun didn't like because there was more it was more Java plus
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   Right it was a JVM plus
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.940]   It was you know you use the same tools. Yeah, yeah a
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:48.160]   Ubuntu for Android, which was announced last year. I remember seeing it at CES
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:56.920]   Is gonna be the first step and then at some point there'll be a kind of a native non-java
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:03.760]   Phone OS based on Ubuntu supporting ARM and x86 Intel must like that now's the time
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.320]   I see Microsoft I hate to get into the phone business right about now
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.400]   This there's a whole set of these you know that the sort of open source tight is broken. There's this there's Tizen
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:20.240]   There's the Firefox browser. There's the Firefox phone. You know that suddenly people say oh, you mean we can do this too
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.520]   And that remember me go and I mean there were a lot of other open source phones
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.720]   I'm saying they're all gonna succeed, but it's you know
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.520]   We're seeing that there's there's a possibility space out there for people to do this
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:39.640]   It's the what this party says is the carrier lockers has gone. Yeah use the stage one of any mobile business
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   You speak let's go into some carriers
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.880]   And this is this is no longer true, right?
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:49.400]   And there's a huge currently untapped smartphone market in the underdeveloped world's
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:56.460]   Where the iPhone and most Android phones are way too expensive still I like in this approach to what app
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:02.280]   Operate does with browsers right there is opera ever gonna be the number one browser probably not it's gonna be number two probably not
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.680]   But it's in there and making noise is it making money? I guess it is
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.200]   Yeah, they have all kinds of I mean they have all kinds of other little sub companies that opera right but
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.800]   You know now's the time if if micro if windows phone isn't doing well I
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:23.680]   Mean I if I'm gonna do an OS now is it yeah, you know well blackberry 10 everybody's talking about coming out the end of the month
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   Whoo one day
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.180]   Tomorrow I don't know one day one day January 30th. I think it's coming
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   It's
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.220]   It's almost too easy
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.980]   So you know what they're gonna have what a thing that means that you can't take a picture quietly
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:47.820]   You have to hold the phone like I am taking a picture now watch out. That's for business
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:53.540]   That's for government because that's a problem with these phones is people bringing camera phones and that you can't bring them into most of a
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.820]   secure installations
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.700]   Well
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.580]   Every blackberry user I know is a sessible tape over it
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:08.140]   Here's my tape over it no cuz spies will put in see through tape over it. Yeah
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.320]   I can't hide a camera in anything else. I'm wearing it's a good come on unless you have an invisibility
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.540]   It's a good point. You know how big cameras are these days and gadget was at the launch and
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   Apparently a boot to show to Nexus Galaxy Nexus phone
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.260]   Which had been modified to run?
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.820]   Ubuntu for phone really it's pretty
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.020]   But I don't see I don't think about this is
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.980]   At the same with the Firefox phones
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.080]   They're basically taking Android models and run them on that because there's this available
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.540]   Infrastructure of these devices that will happily put with a next go and off
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.000]   And then you can install other stuff on top. So in some ways this is an outgrowth of the of the you know
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.060]   alternative
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:52.660]   Android OS hacking community and if people are just taking a bit further saying what if we replace a bigger chunk of this right
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:58.780]   So I think that's healthy. It's good. Yeah, this is slides in from up down left and right kind of like
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:03.060]   The windows 8 charms bar. Yeah, if you can you show this to John?
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:09.760]   So you slid down to get the messages kind of like notifications slid slid up to get home you get application
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:15.620]   Menu by sliding in from the left. Yeah, I like that. That's pretty neat UI. You know what else?
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.620]   It's fairly snappy isn't it? It looks like it anyway for those not watching on video
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   You can go to engadget calm and look at their first hands on of
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.820]   I mean, it's worth taking a look. It's cool, right looks good
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.700]   What about Intel getting into the TV business at first the rumors where they would announce it at
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.060]   CES Intel was quick to say not gonna be ready
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:43.980]   Never internet based TV service and hardware to take on Apple TV
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.660]   One person according to the Wall Street Journal one person familiar with Intel's thinking
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.220]   The shill who called us from Intel's PR department
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   predicted the
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.780]   Predict that the company would launch its offering by mid 2013
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.620]   Maybe not even till the fourth quarter
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:10.100]   Maybe not signing delays in reaching content licensing isn't that the issue the apples facing everybody's facing?
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.100]   I was thinking about this
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.500]   It's all they they had they will sell you TV shows and they got pretty much yeah the big companies there
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:23.740]   Yeah, but they're not a set-top box yet. They're not they're not they haven't got the deals with the live right
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.740]   incumbents yet that NBC CBS and ABC are saying
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.700]   Yeah, but people care about that. I know you don't care because you're an erudite Britisher
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:39.780]   Live stream through through VPN, but that's yeah
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.660]   That's different because you can do that because the BBC is paid for by the public in Britain
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:50.140]   But here the networks they even block Hulu or unless you know they even block
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.580]   Google TV unless you're watching it through the who you know, they're very funny about
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.420]   They're nervous about this. I'll pay the BBC for it if I could but I can't so I have to use tongue
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.060]   It's you you would give them money. Oh, yeah
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.060]   Just as I would give HBO money to let me watch it without a subscription to Tomcast
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.180]   I was watching at the top of the pop's
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.540]   Christmas records from the UK and Christmas day
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:18.360]   Very job and hilarious bet you didn't have any barking dogs in there. Oh, no, they were even weirder. This was
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.660]   Really straight like I remember that Jesus. That was surreal
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:33.180]   What the hell? Why are these like the Eurovision songs? Oh God, I would like to hear that. Yeah, I'd say it's
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:37.220]   You probably wouldn't actually you know what I'm watching on BBC America that I really like is the hour
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.300]   Have you seen that so I'm what's the first episode of that? I haven't actually caught up with it
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.700]   But I've seen bits of it big family in between years. I think the first one is up in the first is up on Netflix
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can watch it and I think I can get it. I bought it on iTunes is what I did
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.940]   Okay, but I could have but it's good. I can do my imitation
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:04.400]   It's pretty annoying I was a DJ for years
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:14.140]   What is this one is weird things for me as it is that the American Christmas music is completely different from the bridge Christmas music and partly is
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.300]   You have any carols here you only have actually secular Christmas. Oh, yeah
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:27.740]   Around the Christmas tree would it's all that crap. Yeah, but there's the bridge but the British ones are also just
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.180]   sort of strange, you know
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:36.700]   But you have things like God rest. She married gentlemen. They're actual carols, right?
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:42.780]   But but there's but there's also all these like novelty Christmas records by you know by bands. We got those two like
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:50.480]   What's that? Yeah, and then they're not you know, they're not like you know, they're not listening the classics. They're like we just made up a Christmas song
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.300]   Well, that's what you're listening to in America. It's just they're old. They're so old that they're not got
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:05.980]   Something yeah, that's the same thing. They're not carols. They're just they're they're like when you put this with Santa Claus coming to town
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:11.560]   Which is like 40 years old now, too, isn't it right? Yeah, it's an oldies thing. Why is no one written a new Christmas song?
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.940]   Well, I I'm thinking Emerson Lake and Palmer father Christmas and then I realized that was 30 years ago
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.460]   That seemed modern to me
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:30.020]   It's old stuff. So that's a challenge people right new Christmas on good Christmas. I'm sure Taylor Swift has a new Christmas
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:35.380]   Oh Bieber has his Christmas album. They all have beber. Do you like beber's ink? You're a fan of ink
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:40.380]   I was beber got a tattoo a tattoo as many tattoos. He's old enough
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:47.140]   Well, we don't know how old he is. I'm sure he's actually 43 just looks like he's 18 very surprised by this
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:52.020]   Oh, he's changing his image. He's a bad boy now. He's I think he I think he's actually a bad boy
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:59.820]   Yeah, I mean his car gets pulled over like every day. Well, it was sad story yesterday that paparazzi who got killed trying to take a picture of his car
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.940]   Here's his his old tattoo in the six. I mean, I can't pass judge
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.100]   That's the foot of a 40 year old man. That is not an 18 year old foot
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.500]   He's got bunions for Christ's sake. Well, he's on stage. I'm not well. I don't care
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:17.020]   Good for him. I think that hair hides more
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.100]   Then just his forehead. I think he should work on not getting pulled over
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.980]   That's what she work on
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.980]   I don't know why we got to this
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:31.540]   Google I like this from business insider. I don't know if it's true. I will pose it to you
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:38.780]   Our esteemed guests today by the way, if you're just tuning in Jeff Jarvis and Gina have the have the year off
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:44.020]   Kevin Marks
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:50.100]   From salesforce.com and Tamil vision TV and you're rolling off now tech crunch. Congratulations. Thank you very much
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   Our our pundits of the week
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.380]   This is Nicholas Carlson running a business insider Google is attacking Apple from the inside out
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.380]   They're actually making an interesting point that
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:09.060]   Basically a lot of us take the Apple apps on the iPhone move them to a folder on the back page and use Google's Chrome
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:17.260]   Did you do that on my many that's right it's all Google and Kindle and there's no Google Plus yep the Google search tool
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.060]   Gmail instead of Apple mail
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:23.340]   Google Maps instead of Apple Maps YouTube
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.300]   Is there a G2 half the works yet? I?
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:31.700]   Don't you can do hangouts with the Google Plus app, but I don't think you could do G talk
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:38.020]   There's messaging there's nested messaging, but somehow is different than G chat. I don't even know
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   Yes, but you can't is a problem the Google has to address by the way, which is a plethora of strange things
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   There's things need to be there's overlap nicely. Yes
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   It's interesting. It's the old Trojan horse thing, right? It's like
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:59.620]   But I'll tell you what I don't know what their overall strategy is but the mobile folks the mobile designers over at Google
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:00.500]   They're doing great
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.540]   They got the groove back that cuz that's a nice or phenomenal rate the new YouTube app
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.500]   Which mirrors very nicely the new YouTube web interface is really well done
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   I think and maps is just
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.580]   It's phenomenal. They've been not as pretty as Apple maps
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:18.940]   But at least it has places in the right spot. They did some new things with it there the UI and UX is like completely
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.580]   It's not what people were expecting and they've worked on it for a long time
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.920]   They worked on it way longer than people thought Liz Gaines wrote that 2012 was the year
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:33.300]   She stopped basically stopped using apples iOS apps indeed. I haven't used she says stocks compass
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.500]   There's a I forgot about compass until I read a record
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.820]   Compass instead of music she uses Spotify tune in in songs as instead of apples weather
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:46.580]   Weather live actually there's a lot of great weather. Yeah, there are instead of notes ever note
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.740]   Google Maps Chrome Gmail
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:56.780]   It's you know, it's not just it's not just Google everybody a lot of people have
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:03.780]   Gmail counts are Google accounts and there's you I mean you can use Gmail within Apple males
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.580]   But it thinks experiences and that great so smart of Google
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:13.460]   To just not take it on head on just say just making better iOS will take our time
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.340]   Well, but is I mean it's also the stuff always work there because it was working in the browser
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.700]   And that's okay
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.180]   Now it's worth spending the time to do this and make this work there as well
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:26.100]   So you you never not been able to use it on there even when Apple was like finding them fairly hard
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:33.060]   And now it's like now Apple is being more you know calm about it and letting them build apps now
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:36.860]   I understand that's it's a good one. That's what that Microsoft deputy council was saying
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   Why isn't Google trying to take us over from the inside?
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.140]   Because nobody
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.820]   That's why when more than 40 people buy a phone on there. It's not worth
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   We don't want to take you over from the inside
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:56.100]   Look I used to work for an app development company and we sat there and we discussed windows phones like do we want to build it?
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.340]   Survey says waste of our time
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.540]   Everybody everybody has a limited budget
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:07.220]   You know, there's no infinite even Google doesn't have an infinite development budget and you make some you have to always make some decisions
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:11.180]   It's another thing that you have to pay attention to once you build the app and it's in the store
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.900]   You have to maintain it. You can't let it go to crap
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:21.900]   Whatever we'll see weird. Am I in our chatroom says Microsoft is taking itself over from the inside. That's actually I think what happened
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.380]   Probably it's like it like from alien lawyers are blah
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:31.220]   Merry Christmas lawyers are blogging. Oh, yeah ships consoles to developers. Oh gosh darn it
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:37.340]   Why did I buy into that I bought into every Kickstarter thing there is I haven't received one thing I got a bra
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.860]   Which by the way is being sued by another bra manufacturer the Joey bro
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:47.300]   It's a pout it was a bra for your iPhone and then somebody said doctor told me you should not put
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:54.780]   You shouldn't strap no, it's for your boobies. You shouldn't strap your iPhone to your breasts. That's that's gonna give you a man cancer
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:55:01.300]   So I don't wear it actually was too small. Oh that's for my stocky friend. No, I got it for a friend
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:07.580]   Sure, actually has a breasts but at point being that's the only Kickstarter project. I have received
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:13.140]   Yet, I can't wait for this thing. I'm I wish I had bought the developer one. I'm sad now stoked
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:19.500]   Those of you who spent six hundred ninety nine dollars for this. It's an Android based game platform, right?
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:24.680]   It's what you would get is the developer account console was only
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:30.900]   1,200 of them, but they were they're being shipped out now it there was a lot of incitement when this happened
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.060]   Did I wonder if Jason howl or somebody from all about Android Jason? Did you buy an uya?
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:39.460]   Did you buy the uya Kickstarter? No, see
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.660]   It was Japan Joey bra
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:49.260]   So what's different about the oh yeah, then just plug it out or into the TV well controller
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:55.860]   Yeah, it's a market right a market and it's got a sit back experience a lean back experience
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:01.300]   This is a sort of talk about perfect timing to cube the size of your fist with a Tegra 3
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:07.580]   Processor is kind of low-end, but all right quad quad-court a gig of RAM eight gigs of flash
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:12.780]   HDMI with 1080p yeah 802.11 BGN
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:21.320]   Bluetooth 4 a USB port and ice cream sandwich. How much they raised it was just ridiculous. Let me go to Kickstarter
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.940]   Who did Tom?
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:30.580]   Tom merit ordered one a new thing to Tom merit wins in the in the game
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.140]   They raised eight point five million
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.780]   Dollars that's nine hundred percent over their ass
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:45.420]   Now they have sixty three thousand building users who will use this platform maybe that's a way to first
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.780]   You got to get a game going on well that yeah, so the developers now have it in their hands
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   Maybe and they can start making their games
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:57.700]   It solves you can go to uya.tv now and buy yep by pre-order it how much is it?
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.260]   $99
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.260]   That's
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.580]   Not bad, but again like with all Kickstarter things there's always this kind of pre-order one, but you're right
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.820]   Will there be a good game will there be anything there be anything come out right will there be a good game?
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:14.220]   Yeah, you get one controller extra controller $30
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.380]   It's 99 bucks. That's pretty tempting
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.700]   It'll be angry. It'll have angry birds. I'll bring it in when I get mine
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.420]   And you can get I
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.900]   It's just it's my I like going to my
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.660]   Kickstarter page and
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:35.380]   Looking at my history of the things that I have backed not that I have never they want my pass
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.940]   Okay, let's just log in here real quickly just curious patron of the art slio. That's what I am
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.140]   Are you are you a Kickstarter guy Kevin?
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:47.260]   I've done some things on it. I'm I bought a few bits of me sitting there and XO XO was the biggest thing
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.900]   I spent which I was definitely worth that was cool. That was the conference. Yeah, that's a really and you went to that
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.980]   I know you were at it. Did you speak at it? Yeah?
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:59.860]   That's no, no, but I backed it like within a couple of hours of it going out
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.940]   So I actually got a good a ticket and that was that was great
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:07.140]   And I've bought chili sauces and a bunch of other random things off kickstarter. Well, let's see
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.500]   I bought an ostrich pillow supposedly that's coming
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:16.900]   Okay, I got I did get the 10 terra eco-friendly bamboo case for the iPad transparent. You're just showing it all right here Oculus Rift
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   That's that virtual reality headgear. Okay
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:26.660]   They got my money, but they nifty mini drive. This is a a goes in the Macbook
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:31.420]   And as acts as in the SD card slacks as an external drive
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:37.140]   I'm glad this didn't go. I I pledge a thousand dollars to have them record an album on the moon
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:43.220]   So it was unsuccessful wonder why coffee filter system
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:50.580]   Collecting my money. These not Joey brah. That's it. That's the one thing I got the pebble remember the pebble e-watch
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   What are they raise millions of dollars?
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:58.500]   Dice I got these dice this got funded in over a year ago nothing
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:03.740]   So what's the oh but here diaspora that was the first thing I did on kickstarter
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:08.300]   Facebook replace
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.940]   You know, but what is it? But what does it what happens if they never ship it? You don't get your money back?
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:19.580]   No, of course not you're an investor. You're not a buying nothing. I don't imagine you're buying anything
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:27.020]   This should be a whole market for things that people have funded but didn't get done like people can come along and do and make money
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:33.260]   No, I think there's a reason they didn't get done. Well, so Intel's Intel's TV. Let's get back to the sub. Yes
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:38.220]   What is this gonna be that it's not the Apple TV's not besides running an Intel processor?
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.420]   It sounds me too to me. I
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:47.620]   Don't know until anyone can get the control of all the live television and do the deals with the networks
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:53.440]   It's not I'm not sold on it's tough a web TV. There's been web TV for 15 years remember
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:59.100]   Why is Intel doing this? What is it? I mean traditionally they make the stuff so that other people can do these things
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:05.740]   I guess I can tell doesn't make PCs they make you know designer reference PCs, but they don't make PCs
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:11.020]   Maybe now that Microsoft's making PCs that Intel says well, we got to get in the game. They don't make phones
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.020]   Unless I'm really good
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.300]   But yeah, but
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:22.380]   Why you know I think this is this is going away in it there are there are all these little Android HDMI sticks
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.700]   You can get for like 50 bucks now
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:30.980]   That is you know the size of an HDMI connection plug it in the back and it'll drive the screen and you can it'll connect to any networks
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   You got lying around and these Bluetooth devices
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:40.020]   So you know an Apple has already set the price point very low on this to the point where you know Google Google's next
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:46.700]   Compete with right that was 300. That was 300 bucks. They're the other things are hundred bucks. They're very nice. They did a job
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:52.220]   But these Google sticks are broke. Oh 40 bucks. Roku's still doing well. I got a Roku stick
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.140]   What's in the MHL HDMI port? Yeah, so you know there's that that
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:06.180]   And if you buy a TV you've already got all that features built in now, so I don't know where the I don't know where the opportunity lies
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:12.340]   The UX of the TV is still like in the dark ages unless they've changed a lot in the last year or so, but you know
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:18.760]   Why look at I look at Tivo because Tivo did everything right great UI really worked wonderful
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.980]   Yes, it should have been the set-top box and for a brief moment direct TV actually did have a set-top box with
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.820]   Tivo built in and then it went away and yeah people buy Tivo and they're still alive
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:36.700]   But it's not it can't take off because it's you have to have an IR blaster and it's too complicated
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:41.780]   Regular folks can't figure that out. I gotta come as a set-top box. It does and but again
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.900]   This is like the the cable you know the cable companies and the network saying no
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:51.860]   They don't want to do it. No, they don't want to lose ad revenue from people who like record stuff and then skip over the advertisements
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.020]   So I got we got Kevin Marks on
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.700]   By the way, we coming up at three o'clock. We've got an incredible triangulation
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.740]   You're gonna want to stay tuned for Dan Ariele the author of predictably irrational will be on how cool
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:10.700]   What a great book that that book. Yeah, if you want to understand why the Wall Street Journal has three different prices
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:15.420]   It's cheaper to get the Wall Street Journal online plus paper
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:22.380]   Then it is just to get the Wall Street Journal online why Dan explains that there's a reason for reasons like it's brilliant
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.460]   Oh, so have you read that book Kevin? Love when people explain things
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:30.660]   Wonderful that well I keep getting I've got I accidentally got signed up with the most gentleman to be delivered now
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.660]   I can't get rid of it. It's really nice. I know
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:40.020]   They want you to get the paper. I don't understand why it costs more not to get the paper. Why there's a reason?
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.940]   stay tuned
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.460]   Googles, but I'm glad you're here Kevin because you can explain this VP9
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:53.260]   VP8 wasn't good enough. So now we have VP9 is this web M
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:59.660]   Whoops, he's gone. He hung up. He's like I don't want to talk about it
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.740]   We should explain that besides being the micro format screw-rew the guy
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:09.620]   But Kevin was the guy who brought quick time to Apple wasn't was responsible for quick time at Apple knows
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:15.900]   Codex very well as the expert on that and of course Skype it took this moment to disconnect him
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.100]   So it's building up the excitement
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:25.260]   Because I sure know nothing about Chrome has so VPA was the idea VPA was this is a
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:31.020]   Kodak that is unencumbered. This is a problem that he has with all the other video
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.740]   We got Kevin back so he can explain this
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:39.060]   You mentioned this my yeah, of course Chrome has VP9 built in so
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:45.100]   And then also this new opus audio compression which I've been starting to hear about this is another open source
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.860]   Or is it opens is it open source?
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:53.500]   Oh, I'm not sure that everything else is in orientation
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:04:00.540]   But there's oh dear the least the leaf blower brigade has arrived. Yep. Sorry about that
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:07.940]   So Kevin I love Kevin cuz he he is you could tell he worked at the BBC he worked in television
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.340]   He's always looking for the beautiful
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:17.140]   Backdrop we've had Kevin call in from the atop the Moscone Center at her boy in a garden in San Francisco beautiful
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.660]   He's always in his backyard or garden as they would as the Britzer want to call it
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.300]   I don't know where you are. It looks like you're in your garden
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.060]   But unfortunately so are the gardeners
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:38.060]   So let's see VP9 and opus our codecs
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:45.540]   The problem of course with H.264
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:56.700]   HVC is that these are encumbered by patents and they're owned by somebody and now I will interpret the hand signals
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:05.260]   Write it down and hold it up the issue as I understand it and Kevin you shake your head yes or no is that
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:09.500]   Currently HTML5 has a bracket video bracket tag
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:14.980]   But it doesn't have any standard implementation of what bracket video bracket well this does
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.460]   Is the problem is there's dispute between the different companies about what they should do
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.980]   H.264 has kind of been settled on his day factor
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.980]   But that requires a patent license means you can't build an open source version of it right?
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   Epic LA owns it right and pick it ever LA owns it and wants money for it and you know there are you know
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:39.100]   There's a there's a lower threshold upper threshold in theory you can actually build an open source version of it
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.540]   But it's messy right and conversely apple says
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:49.980]   If we use this other one that doesn't have a patent license we could be sued and we're a huge target because we're apple
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   We'll be sued. Yeah, in other words
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:57.300]   They're saying yeah, you can have VB8 and VP9, but you can't indemnify us against
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:04.540]   It being somehow somebody's patent there's violating and now with the patent trolls out there. It's almost guaranteed you'll get sued
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:10.380]   So better to get something like h.264 where it's known who owns it and you can give them a buck
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:14.420]   And you know the thing is Apple's vision hasn't changed all this in in
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:20.500]   12 years because when I was at Apple I spent a big chunk of time trying to get them to ship vorbus in quick time and being told
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.700]   No, you can't do that
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:27.580]   We'll get sued right and if you make us lose our license to to decompress the audio in DVDs
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.380]   You'll be an almost unpopular and I'm not gonna think I'm really
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:36.660]   And and that if you actually listen to what Apple is saying they're still saying
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.980]   Somebody somewhere will pop up with a pattern on this and it might be told we'll have some up your frown
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:47.740]   Half or it maybe someone like that and they will say it you cannot you cannot do this unless you indemnify us
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.060]   You know this problem. It's like you are the richest company in the world
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.660]   I don't think you need to be indemnified by an open source developer grow up Apple, right?
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.700]   And yeah, but
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.500]   You're gonna get me going on patents now. That's yeah, we could go on and on and on about patents
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.200]   There's a leaf blower in the chatroom. I wish somebody would just
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.580]   patent the leaf blower and we could put it out of business
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.620]   MPEG LA I think is spreading a little fud about all this when VP8 was announced
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:25.500]   They said well we've talked to 12 unnamed organizations who say they have patents that VP8 violates
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.180]   Remember Google bought on two technologies which created VP8
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.460]   It was to get a bunch of good video engineers
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:39.660]   And the other reason was to get to get these codecs and be able to have something that was opening license for
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:45.620]   Right, and that was investment now and that's that was you know that was I think a better investment than buying up
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:52.380]   Up some of these patent pools. They're buying from companies like Kodak and things which seems like an enormous sort of money sink
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:59.820]   Attacks on doing business for these companies. I had I was having conversation with with I'm not sure I should credit who it was
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:06.380]   But someone said you know if Google actually said if we took a billion dollars and decided to fight every one of these stupid patents instead of buying
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:10.100]   This the patents from this company that would be a really useful thing for Google to do
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:15.500]   Rob that would that would actually change this thing because there was another case today
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:24.620]   Of it was an ours technica where they somebody is going around suing everyone who scans documents
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:31.380]   The make them small businesses that have documents scanners and demanding a
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:38.420]   Thousand dollar per employee license for this. Oh, it's some you know some bunch of lawyers on the east coast who bought the patent from a corpse and
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.220]   Going around you know
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.860]   Harrassing people and then they got some publicity about it
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:50.580]   They've now split the company into 16 companies with six letter names that nobody can pronounce and that and they've they're trying to do
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.900]   They've sort of hide all these evil
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.820]   Patent litigation stuff in lots of small companies and carrying on doing the same thing to the yeah
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:02.460]   There is there is some massive brokenness here and we need to just say no
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.540]   This is broken. We're gonna find ways around it. We have found ways around it
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:11.060]   Shouldn't Google just step up and indemnify it and say look all right. We understand you're nervous about it
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.900]   We believe it's unencumbered. We will defend you. We will indemnify you
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:18.940]   I mean, you know the question is indemnification is is messy
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:25.580]   Right that they said we will fight this you know, I think and the identification is why it's like I will I will make you whole and
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.580]   Whatever, it's like no
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.580]   We already have these
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.500]   Microsoft does this with Linux by the way Microsoft to demifies people who use Linux
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.560]   Encouraging use use Microsoft products naturally
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.820]   I didn't know that one. That's but isn't that wild?
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:45.020]   That's surreal
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.820]   but the one me is that
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.020]   The point is we have these
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:57.180]   Pattern policies for open source stuff and for open standard stuff to say this should be a royalty-free thing
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.220]   And we've we've built up structures to do that to the point where we can all
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:06.300]   Work to you know, Microsoft is committing code to webkit now that you know, we're at the point
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.300]   We'll be on that point with the web stuff
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:14.460]   But we're at the but we haven't gone the stage further and said and we will mutually defend each other against
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.860]   this kind of nonsense now
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   the web stuff has
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:25.500]   Damped down a bit there is less of the nonsense around suing everyone who's able to use a hyperlink or any of these other
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.340]   City web lawsuits because they suspect they will you know the big companies will sign up and hit them
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.820]   But there isn't like this sort of mutual defense and
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.140]   so partly
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.220]   And the video stuff is still way worse and the mobile stuff is even more a rat hole
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.340]   But there's I think there's potential here to do this
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:47.140]   But what's basically happening is we're just waiting for these things to expire most of these video patterns are 20 years old nearly
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:53.860]   Yeah, and we just see here waiting for things to die out and the sad part is we haven't come up with any new ways of encoding video in the last 20 years
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.980]   Twi is it 24 years and out?
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:01.920]   Anyway 20 years ish for the duration of a right right?
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.460]   By the way, and thanks to the chat room for passing along this link from broadband reports a
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.900]   patent troll named brandy wine communications is suing
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.540]   Internet service providers for using DSL gear they've sued they're suing
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   39 ISPs to date
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:25.280]   Claiming that they violated DSL related patent that they that they own if we just all
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.900]   Disconnect and lived in a log cab and those would get their repatrials to come out for those two like they've sued
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:37.100]   AT&T Verizon Century link they're in the process of settling with earth link. They're suing win stream
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.540]   Icono megapath formerly covad. This is why companies overcharges for things because they have to
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.820]   Litigate and deal with all these track the patent. We know this is a problem. Why isn't anything being bad about it?
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.940]   We've been talking about this for years. Yeah, I like wine. I gave a prayer about that
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:58.740]   Really go on Mary. He'll go off on he goes off. He goes off on it. I love David
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:03.660]   Couple more stories and we can wrap this up
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:09.060]   So there's also someone who's got a patent James have a patent on SSL. Oh god
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.360]   Oh, what's the pattern on patents? Yeah, that's it's actually there's a pattern on patterns
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.900]   There's a pattern on patent rolling that was filed by what are they called?
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:28.700]   What's that intellectual ventures Nathan mere volts? No, no, it's even weird in that is this
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.980]   We're was to Chinese company that was involved
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.500]   Hello Burton as a palaburn as a patent on patent
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:42.000]   You would I'm moving to North Korea. That's actually where Google's Eric Schmidt is going there. Let's all go
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.820]   He is going to North Korea on a private humanitarian mission led by a former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:55.700]   According to the Associated Press. That's cool. He's not going as a he's going as a private citizen. Yeah
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:02.540]   Time on his hands on he's gonna bring old fruit cakes. He's got a few. Yeah, I don't know what he's bringing
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.140]   That's neat
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.860]   I'm moving moving along Samsung speaking of patents
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:16.660]   It's Apple to smooth try to seal the sales data
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:24.140]   Lucy co I love I love Judge Lucy co yesterday denied Samsung's request
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:30.940]   To keep sales figures secret during their appeal of the $1 billion judgment that Apple won
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:38.160]   Against them. So we'll find out at some point in the near future exactly how many phones Samsung has sold
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.700]   Stay tuned. That'll be fun. I think so nice to have hard numbers
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.260]   And in another court news
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.260]   Amazon has one dismissal of Apple's false advertising claim
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:57.860]   This happened in Oakland, California, US district judge Phyllis Hamilton said no you can use the term app store
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   Apple said that Amazon was confusing people by using the words app store for their Amazon Android app store and
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.980]   They wanted him to stop doing it
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.220]   According to the judge Amazon hasn't shown
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:17.660]   that Amazon's advertising has
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:26.100]   Confused anybody or was a false statement. There was no evidence of customers were misled the judgment was for Amazon or the courts found that
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:32.980]   The Amazon set can say app store because if you're on that stupid they can find one person that was confused that they thought
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:39.340]   They could Apple's app store then yeah, exactly. That's so stupid. That's so much wasted money and time
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:44.620]   Well, you know, you got you know, you have to defend your brand when you pay lawyers by the month
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.620]   And you got a building full of them, right?
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:50.660]   You got to do some with it and if you don't and if you don't protect your trademarks and brands
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.980]   They you don't keep them busy. They get they get very you know, you know, you know
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.900]   Idle lawyers of the devil's workshop. I'm just saying
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:05.980]   Google pages gonna get analytics, that's cool. Yeah
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:12.180]   Google plus pages Google plus pages. Yeah. Yeah as they should right. Yeah one Linux. That's a Google thing. Mm-hmm
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:16.460]   75% of the world's heads have stayed are now on Twitter
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:21.860]   You guys if you're one of the 25, it's not you go what a what are you doing?
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:28.620]   Even the pope is on Twitter pope tweet and in Latin no less among other languages
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.340]   Good for the I
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:36.860]   Didn't know this but Twitter it turns out for years has been making a concerted effort to get celebrities to use Twitter
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.580]   Oh, yeah, they have a whole department. They have a whole department. Yeah, I
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:46.180]   Mean, you know, they they want certain personalities and certain people to be using the platform
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.100]   It makes them look better, right? And then CNN's talking about Twitter
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:53.580]   So they you know, they want to be able to say the pope on settle in Twitter. I mean, it's I
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:59.060]   Feel let down by that. I know anyone who's not on Twitter right now. They never asked me on it anymore
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.580]   They did verify me they didn't or they did they did they did okay?
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.020]   I thought you have to find me
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.100]   Have you as anybody use blue stacks?
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:10.540]   This is an interesting idea blue stacks is a
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:16.740]   Emulator that lets you supposedly use Android apps on your Mac sold. Yeah
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.740]   Well, I've got one of those it's part of the SDK what no no
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.260]   Yeah, but do you have to have it like a little phone window that like you're using a phone?
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.860]   This would allow them to run as kind of peer as as apps. Oh, oh, oh
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.500]   It's still kind of weird, but okay
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:42.140]   There's a beta version out there. It'll allow users to download and install every app on the Google Play Store
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:46.100]   What what that's amazing. That's really cool
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.780]   There's about half a million apps up there and you could just run them in a window
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.780]   You don't have to have the little phone window sure
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:56.460]   You can run them. It's an emulation at they call it layer cake
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:03.020]   Because it has to emulate more than just Android and Dalvik it has to emulate arm, right? It's not
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.380]   Fruit ninja angry birds
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.900]   That's nifty. Yeah
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:16.140]   And the Bluestacks was originally just written to do it for a Windows 8 Windows phone 8
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.260]   That's one way to get Android on Windows phone 8
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.460]   Mm-hmm
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:30.460]   Wasn't that wasn't that what rim was doing at one point and to give up on that they were they were
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   Emulator they said that they would do that. I never tried it but like that the playbook would run Android
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.020]   I said they're gonna do a lot of things. Yeah, they said they were gonna do that
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:45.700]   Record volume of apps downloaded on Christmas Day to go along with all those activations, right?
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:51.740]   The first thing people do it was something like what was it a billion? What was it a billion apps?
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.780]   Amen, let me see the number if I could find it
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:18:03.460]   Three I'm sorry. No, I overestimated 328 million apps on December
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.100]   325 that's up from 155
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:15.060]   The average for the first three weeks of December now how many of those that were downloaded will ever get open to you know
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:20.780]   And then there's a great graph. This is flurry again. This is that company so there this it's not official
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.500]   But there's this great graph of this is December 25th
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:30.420]   This big hump as people get up open their Kindle their mini their iPad
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   They're fire and they download crap
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.940]   Just a ton of them like I look at the split with tablets tablets are surging. Yeah
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:47.660]   Yeah, in fact Apple even said or actually was Andy Rubin even said that the majority were Apple downloads not Android downloads and mostly because of
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.980]   tablets
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.980]   mini. Yeah
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:57.420]   All right cool cool. He says cool. I know no I'm gonna lunch
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:04.420]   No, I want to play with this emulator is what I'm gonna. Yeah, that's that could be a great that could be a great tip
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.860]   Do you either we normally we would do the Google change log gene is not here
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:12.940]   So I'm not gonna bother with that normally we would do a tool a number and a tip of the week
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:19.380]   I'm gonna be very informal here. We've got the bizarro twig crew you guys anything you'd like to tell people
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:25.300]   That they should try or use or anything like that. I can I have a couple of things if if you guys don't
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:28.980]   Let me think I'm let me ask
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:32.800]   Anything you'll be playing with and I'm just where there is let me ask you you but you're using the Samsung
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.900]   Chromebook and the hot one that you couldn't how do you like it? I love it?
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.460]   I mean that my thing with Chrome OS is like
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:42.180]   When you think about what you use on a laptop
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:47.780]   It's the browser a lot right so the fact that they have an operating system based around the browser makes total sense
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:53.020]   And it has a hard drive. I mean it does everything I needed to do it's not it's not a hard drive now
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:57.540]   It's not the fast. Yeah, it's not the fastest D. Yeah, it's not the fastest device
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:03.220]   But it you know you can get it with 3g if you want it's great with what it's fine
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.460]   It's it's what that's what I'm looking for. It's fine. I'm looking for a computer. That's just fine
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:12.320]   Hey, my Macbook Pro can't hold a
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.660]   Charge for more than 45 minutes at this point well
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.780]   That's just because you need a new computer or a new battery or a new whatever. Yeah, but this thing
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:27.020]   I think how many hours you get three three and a half hours of like you can you if you don't get ten
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.340]   I don't see any reason to do it. I love to see ten hours on anything. Well your tablet does ten
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:37.380]   You got an iPad mini there that gets down. Oh sure well depends on what services I have on I have 3g or 4g running on it
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:41.380]   So let's go it way down location kills and yeah all those items do
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.980]   But when I'm working on me I use it heavily so so far so good
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:50.620]   I still do like the next ten. I heard a lot of people who were getting their parents Nexus 7s for Christmas
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:55.420]   I wish I could get a Nexus 10. They had a few at the like a Best Buy. Yeah
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:01.860]   And this is seven back on seven yet. I'm gonna get my son. I was 10 is is like
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:07.340]   300 dpi or something 270 dpi. It's incredible. It's gorgeous, but it doesn't have three
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:11.860]   They don't have three g-mod yet, so I would wait for that one, but I don't with 3g. I like way for it
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:18.460]   Yeah, and you get just a 3g card or use your phone is it yeah, it's my thoughts. Oh, yeah, we use that open garden
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:19.580]   Yeah
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.180]   What's that open garden there you go? There's a tip what is open garden? I told you it's last time is on
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.900]   Oh, alright open gardens. It uses
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:32.660]   Uses bluetooth to connect your gadgets together so that anyone has any tech connection. They won't have any tech connection
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.940]   And it runs on Android then it runs on laptops less well
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.500]   I like if you got like more than one Android device
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:42.100]   It's worth having because it's but you know especially with you've got them
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:48.060]   Yeah, the Nexus 7 that doesn't have 3g and you got the phone that does or 4g then that they will talk to each other and it'll work
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.580]   Haha
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.940]   It's a good one. Have you guys woken up your flicker accounts yet? Yes
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.220]   I love the iOS paid for pro love it
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:01.380]   I'm back even the Android apps good. Although the iOS app is a little bit better. I'll get us. Yeah, that get it get that
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:09.020]   It should be a couple weeks, but yeah, I actually I let my pro laps about six months ago. Me too. My prolapse prolapse prolapse prolapse prolapse
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:14.700]   But you know three months free-dounce it yeah, and then the Christmas they gave me three more months so 40 bucks for two years
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:20.140]   I think it was then I'm happy I'm uploading pictures to it again. It's nice to see signs of life over there again
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:25.340]   Speaking of too many notifications though that app that's notifying me. I get I get all these
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:28.500]   Yeah, it's just like bugging me
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.020]   So I got stuck is it your friend is your friend blah blah blah?
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:38.220]   Yeah, so you just so how do they get up 2,000 photos if they just joined or did that exactly that Facebook account and now you're
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:44.100]   That's what happened or use that Instagram importer. That's what I did. Oh, maybe I'll make this gram
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:48.980]   I imported it you could tell cuz you have an Instagram set with all your Instagram, which is great
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:54.340]   Maybe they're not lying, but it is ways that your friend is just joining us like it has 2,000 pictures. Yeah
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:23:00.540]   They're alive again now flickers waking up a little bit y'all who's happy about that nice to watch it
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.140]   Go ahead. I haven't got a tip. I've got a grumble. It's like grumb why
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:12.060]   Everyone goes on about Android fragmentation. I am really sick of iOS fragmentation. I don't have an iPhone. I have it
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:17.780]   And iPad 2 and half my apps have this black border around them all the time
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.180]   It's like are they mourning the fragmentation of the Apple platform? What's going on here?
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:27.700]   You know my Android apps they get bigger on different screens on iOS everyone is still happy to make these little tiny things that don't do that
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.100]   You can do 2x and you know actually it's it's
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:35.300]   16x on some of the the things now. It's just really really annoying and
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:39.300]   They need to fix it. Isn't it funny cuz so for so long Apple
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.660]   Laughed at Android cuz of fragmentation, right?
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:48.540]   Android started out with lots of different screen sizes. So developers cope with a hand handled it and iOS is like
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:51.740]   Oh, I can still use bit maps. I can pretend this isn't really a issue even though there are now
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:58.980]   What's going on here and you know and there are some nice apps you know flickers one of them flickers like you're a photo app
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.460]   Why am I running you in 2x everything looks pixelated?
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.620]   Yes, there needs to be native. I yeah
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:11.900]   Screen on the wedding screen. I can't imagine how bad that looks but this goes back to the whole Microsoft thing if people aren't building native
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:16.500]   iPad apps, why would they build apps from Microsoft phone? Okay, I'm done
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:21.260]   Yes, everyone build a native iPad app, please
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:28.820]   I do have to say that that is one thing that iOS has down when a developer wants to show off how beautiful they can make an app
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:34.220]   Even Google they make their most beautiful apps for iOS, right Google plus gorgeous then they do it on Android
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:38.900]   Yeah, flicker gorgeous then they do it on Android if you want to say look we are elegant
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:44.980]   We know you why we can make a beautiful UI they always do it for I don't know if it's because it's easier or more likely because
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.980]   Apple users expect that
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:55.960]   But it's I know sure is easier. I mean in some instances easier because yeah, there's some things Apple give you as criminals
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:01.540]   There's an animation permit I talked to Dave Morean at path and you know
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.700]   He said it was easier to do it for iOS because they have animation primitives that we had to actually rewrite for and
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:13.540]   There's a promotional aspect to it too because a lot of developers if they are if they have a great team and are building something gorgeous
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:17.860]   They want Apple to promote it and for Apple to promote your app
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.860]   They you better be iOS only you better be shiny and beautiful. Yeah, you better be iOS only
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.100]   They're not playing with you. That's already put out an Android app. That's a very good point
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:31.380]   Now after you after you get promoted in your path and you've done well, then you could put that's when an Android app comes back out
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:33.620]   Yeah, so that's why you know, that's actually a good point
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:40.220]   So that's Instagram same thing that waited until they got all the totally all the benefit of being in
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:47.140]   You want to be promoted you want to be you know high in the I mean if you're high on the leaderboards in the top free apps
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.140]   You get tons of downloads. Yeah
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.380]   I was good
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:57.500]   I found I can't remember the name of it now. I found a new launcher the one of the things that Android is great is you can
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.900]   You know basically with springboard is it on on I thought you got much jailbreak
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.980]   Yeah, you could jailbreak it, but you're pretty much stuck with Apple's UI
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:10.380]   Yeah, but on Android and keyboard etc and Android and many keyboards as you want and there's some wonderful launchers
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.820]   And I found a new one
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:16.460]   That's free. I think it's a Google guy that developed it and I can't remember the name of it
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:19.860]   But I like it because it has it's it's very clean and simple
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:26.420]   The he's his whole idea was you're never more than one second away from any app on the thing. I like that
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:32.060]   Yeah, it has this new folder type called cover you can it looks like you know like for instance
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.500]   I use my phone icon you tap that it launches you double tap it
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.540]   It opens up with a bunch of phone shortcuts things like that's neat
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:44.060]   Yeah, but I can't remember the name so if anybody I was waiting for the chat room to tell me and
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.620]   They they're failing me again. Lantros are great. Oh customization
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.180]   No, there's what I use mostly, but I can't remember the name of this
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:57.220]   It's kind of a generic launcher name. I'll find it for next week next week Gina and Jeff will be back
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.660]   We missed them a little bit
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.380]   But it's so nice in a you know and we've had these guys on the show with Jeff and Gina
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.900]   It was so nice to have them. It's not go launcher. That's been around for a while
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:13.460]   Maybe it's apex. Maybe it's apex ADW. I've used action launcher. That's it action. There you go
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.740]   You demand whoever said that
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.500]   Some generic thing maybe he's the guy who wrote action launcher maybe
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:29.140]   There's a free version and there's a pro version Chris Lacey is the guy who wrote this and it's it's worth taking a look at try
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:35.500]   The free version and you can kind of see what it can do. It's different, but it's really I think
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:42.540]   Very interesting very sweet. It's brand new and so there were a little bug a couple little buggies that have gone away
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:49.860]   399 for the paid pro version try the free version first, but I have to say I I love it that we're seeing these incredible
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:57.300]   New ui's new launchers people can do that stuff on Android and I'm really play with it
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   It's a competitive
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:03.220]   Yeah, it is and I do and I'm actually back to using Nova launcher because I love Nova launcher
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:07.220]   But action launcher is well well worth looking at if you'd like to try other launchers
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:10.900]   I want to thank Kevin Marks for being here and his leaf-blowing brigade
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.540]   They've gone they've gone they've moved on. That's one good thing about lift rollers. They don't stick around long
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:20.260]   Tom will vision TV anything else you'd like to plug
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:25.560]   No, there was one thing my colleague
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:31.700]   Adam Seligman wrote on read right web that's worth reading that that was about about developers
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:36.540]   I'll stick the link in the in the chat for that all right. That was that was that was I was I was impressed with that
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.580]   basically
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:41.300]   the sort of stand-out line for me was was
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:47.340]   The great thing about get how busy doesn't hold meetings. I want to hire people who do things not hold meetings
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:51.340]   Beautiful summary of I love it the way software is changing
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:57.100]   We'll put a link in the show notes to that article. I love you Kevin. You I ask you for a plug you plug somebody else
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:02.940]   That's what I was that's what I like, but I'll give him a plug to Tomo vision at TV and of course salesforce
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:08.140]   Where you're working on the latest and greatest in communications and stuff?
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:14.880]   Stuff getting getting businesses to be used this use the social web is a big chunk of what we're doing now
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:22.060]   Yeah, yeah, so social is not dead despite what you might think here it is read write web hard questions
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:26.100]   for enterprise developers who want to get ahead
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.420]   it's Adam Seligman in the
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:33.820]   Read right enterprise section good
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:37.700]   He's a VP of developer relations at Salesforce. Yes
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.900]   And he any wise person on New Year's Eve, which is pretty impressive
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.460]   Actually, that's a great time to do it
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:47.820]   I'm watching okay, so I watch rockin New Year's Eve with a tribute to the clerk
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:51.580]   That's fine except that it really annoys me because I found out last year
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:57.460]   They pre tape almost all of it like in October at Disneyland and other it's all it's all taped ahead of time
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:01.260]   There's a little bit of Jenny McCarthy live and she's a knitwit. I can't watch her from one five
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:04.580]   I hate so I'm tuning around once you live right yeah CNN
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:07.300]   Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:13.580]   And I'm shocked what's going on did you see that it was a crap show it was horrible no I loved it
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:14.700]   Oh
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:20.740]   She tried to kiss his sardine. Yes, it was wild. He was like I couldn't believe apparently last year
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:25.340]   She took her shirt off. She took her shirt off trying to like overcomped. I mean they got a thing going I
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:28.260]   Don't know if Anderson
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:35.140]   He was acted surprised a lot, but I think they expected from her they
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   tend to just simulate a sex act on stage and then weird cuz sigh of
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.780]   Bologangam style walks and stands in front of her. She's up here
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:49.420]   He's this down here indeed and she says something like you're really making a lot of money
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:53.740]   You got money coming out of your butt and then his response is coming from you. That's a great
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:58.380]   It was the weirdest New Year's Eve I've ever had
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:03.020]   It was entertaining to say the least you didn't like it. I liked it
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:08.540]   I was I was just she was a little overboard. She was way overboard. I was scary overboard
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.860]   I thought Anderson Cooper's reactions to her were priceless. I
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:18.380]   Just it was real and it was live and I so I thought I wins everything. Yeah, we're gonna do this next year
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   We're gonna have somebody
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:23.700]   I thought you're gonna say New Year's show not it. Well, you should do a live news
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.820]   You show because we will there isn't a west coast one
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:32.540]   I actually wanted to do this and they'd show you a three-year-hour recording of a ball dropping in New York Kevin
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.020]   You and me let's do it next year and drew if you want here
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.620]   I mean I'll tell you what I was gonna do this and that was vetoed by the boss
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.500]   But I really wanted to do this I was gonna do a 24-hour
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:48.900]   I'm a New Year's Eve show where we start in New Zealand and we every hour we have somebody skyping in from
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:54.780]   Wherever it is saying happy New Year happy New Year happy New Year all the way out to Hawaii then I collapse genius
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:32:00.260]   Wouldn't that be great? Well it collapsed meaning you just fall asleep. Well because it's 24 hours. Okay. I just as long as you're okay
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:03.340]   26 hours I think because it was the way the time
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:10.340]   How could it be 26 hours because it can because there's a minus 14 and a plus 13 so it's 27 hours
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:15.780]   28 if you could zero. Yeah, which is London. I'm in
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:20.300]   Be fun. I'm totally in I'm when you kiss my sardine
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.980]   No, we're gonna do that. I'm gonna do that next I wanted to do it this year
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.980]   And we actually brought it up at a staff meeting and everybody said no
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:32.260]   I think people would watch it. No, they said no everybody would be out partying
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:37.940]   But you're right Kevin. There's nothing good on for those of us who don't want to go out on New Year's Eve TV
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:40.580]   Is it especially on the West Coast?
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:48.100]   And yeah, yeah, but you got a sofa I bet I have some we have some people that we could probably get on okay next year
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:52.940]   We'll plan this now. Oh if you start now you can get a lot of cool people. Oh, yeah
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.940]   Yeah hammer to come do the hammer dance
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:59.300]   Dan area like coming up for our triangulation episode the author predictably irrational
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:03.220]   It's gonna be great rule enough is now a tech crunch calm. Do you have a beat?
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:09.620]   You know what? I'm covering Google a whole lot. You got Twitter and Yahoo. You got the beat. Yeah
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:14.900]   Some Google sweater and Yahoo. That's not bad a little bit of four square. Yahoo's kind of interesting. What do you think?
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:18.500]   I mean Flickr it was nice see Flickr back on track
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.820]   You know there are mercs is obviously

[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:34.540]   Getting people who already work there excited right and I went over there and visited and people are actually
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:42.620]   Excited you know fake excited one thing that I notice is that the us geeks want Yahoo to succeed right?
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:48.100]   Why not every I mean the people who grew up with a kabono.stanford.edu
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:53.740]   Yeah, we want we really want Yahoo to come back right am I wrong?
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:56.700]   They're in a great position because you can't lose when you've never won
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.900]   They've never won anything. Oh
