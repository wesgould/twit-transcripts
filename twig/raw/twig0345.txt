[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   And this is fancy. I know this is what we do here
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.200]   It's it's only took you know took us what two years from the time we hatched this idea in Petaluma
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.680]   It's serious business. It's I'm really delighted that it's gonna all pan out. We're very excited about doing a show for New York City
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   Yeah, yeah, well, I heard his schedule. I think I will work
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:34.240]   This is the City University of New York's graduate school of journalism, right and isn't it nice really nice
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.760]   These are some very nice days your tax dollars at work. Yes
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.720]   I'm maybe proud to be a CUNY graduate. I was Brooklyn College, but you know same same
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yes, it is. Yes, we only gradually the only publicly supported graduate school with journalism in the Northeast
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.520]   It's fantastic and these are the students behind us. This is actually the newsroom. So if you can see very much
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.600]   What are they working on stories journalism, man? Is there a newspaper or what?
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.920]   No, no, no, they're working on stories for assignments and then there are some they may
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   entrepreneurial students are working on their businesses and
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   They've done reporting day and they're back
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.520]   There are ghosts in this building though. Yes, there are this is one of the most famous newspapers in the world
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   The old New York Harold Tribune was here. Yeah, it's a 1966
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.360]   The newspaper started by Horace Greeley in the 1800s and and a really great newspaper
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.000]   So this is there's some this is kind of a nice feeling history here. I really like the end of it. Yeah
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.160]   Well, there's some news and we can talk about that
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320]   We want to tip our hat to everybody in the chat room. Yes, we can I can see you
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.000]   I don't know if anybody else can but I can see you and also to our studio people back in Petaluma
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.260]   little tiny cow town Petaluma
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.480]   I feel like if I can make it here
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.800]   Anywhere so and of course Jason Clanthes our producer who's back in the studio. Hi Jason. Thank you for doing this
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.240]   I you know we came out on vacation Lisa and Michael and I our son
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.680]   Michael and
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.080]   We thought well that'd be fun to see the see the place and you this is really good. It's great
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   I'm so I'm so happy you came up here. I know you're interrupting your vacation. No, no, no
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.400]   This is fun. This is cool for for you guys anything and afterwards five napkin burgers. Oh, okay. All right
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.680]   Tell me about the show that you're gonna do from here
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.800]   So we have any burgers our new producer tired
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.480]   She's got a great roundup of some of the people we can talk to
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.360]   We're gonna do the same thing
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.780]   We're gonna do on Twitter and talk about the news and talk about things around New York
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.040]   But as you pointed out you can't really go out from Petaluma interview a chicken
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.000]   We are in the center wait a minute. There's a big chicken text
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.880]   So we are in the center of the universe right here and tech and media tech and fashion
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.720]   Startups finance so we want to go out and bring people in and talk and I'm gonna try to
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.680]   Take Gina's arm and and twist it behind her and get her to come in and host to this is only my first time here
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   This is not my last I'm
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   You know well we can cover Silicon Valley pretty well from from our studios
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.520]   It's really nice to have the East Coast and New York
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.680]   I mean this is you know, we were talking about Silicon Alley which I always thought was a kind of a silly name
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.560]   And I don't know if Jason Calcans didn't start it, but he had the Silicon Alley reporter
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.120]   It almost felt like we're a little bit of like jealousy of Silicon Valley
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.480]   Oh, well, we've got Silicon Alley every town has a little Silicon Valley of some kind
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.560]   I mean locally use it to refer to a particular area of the city because there just isn't you know
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.520]   It doesn't tech everywhere. That's kind of so home kind of Chelsea area
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.240]   Kind of flat on yeah, yeah, not far from here actually
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   So yeah, but maybe it doesn't play as well kind of outside
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.320]   When was the last time you said either Silicon Alley or Big Apple in New York?
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.560]   That's true. I never say it. I sometimes see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, mostly the tourist
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.320]   Silicon Square Times Square Center the universe. Yeah, no, I think this is gonna be exciting. Yeah
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.480]   Well, there's some Google news we could talk about it. I think we should probably start with
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.920]   Related but not Google news, which is of course the Apple news Apple's event on Monday
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.640]   At that time during the event we thought Apple was going to have to face the Department of Justice the next day in court
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:35.680]   That the magistrate judge would be ruling on the FBI's request that Apple helped them unlock the phone Tim Cook obviously thought so and actually
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.240]   I thought made a very brief but very I think eloquent statement saying we didn't never expect to be fighting our country
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.920]   And but we we feel it's our responsibility
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   Actually, he said fighting our government. We feel it's our responsibility to
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.680]   Our customers and our country as opposed to the government perhaps yes
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.400]   To stand up to the government and protect their security and I thought that was really kind of well said yeah
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.520]   And it played really well people liked it. Yeah, I was received well
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.560]   Yeah, and then and then shortly thereafter later that evening the FBI goes to the judge says your honor
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.920]   We don't need to have a hearing we will look for this till April 5th
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.760]   Right, we think we can hack it somebody's come stepped forward
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.880]   The latest news comes from motherboard, which has been doing really I think good tech coverage very good tech coverage lately
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.720]   They say that they believe it's an Israeli company. Well, this comes from a
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.200]   Israeli newspaper called celebrate
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   Which is an Israeli phone forensics firm
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.280]   Apparently while the celebrate executives this is from Harrett's
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.160]   The silicon celebrate executives would not comment they indicated they're confident that a completely hack proof phone has not been invented
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.960]   And they would eventually be able to unlock any existing system on their own
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.200]   So they clearly most have demonstrated they could do it in a similar situation to the FBI and the FBI's you know
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.080]   They're managing their bets. They said if we can't if they can't we'll come back to you April 5th
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.840]   And we still will ask for this help. So here's interesting about that to me is in
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.120]   The world of hacks of things the ethical thing to do is to reveal to the manufacturer the hack that you used
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.360]   They're never gonna reveal to Apple what they use the New York Times had an interesting article talking about that saying everybody Google Facebook
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.440]   Everybody does a bounty if you find a bug you could make hundreds as much as a hundred thousand dollars
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.320]   Bounty Apple has said and I actually like Apple's principles stand well
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.400]   We're not gonna pay for those but as the Times points out maybe that's why companies like celebrate hold on to these zero days and say
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.240]   But I'm really asking another question Leo. What's the ethic?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   In the developer community if you find a vulnerability
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.560]   I believe the ethic is you let the company know about it so they can close it. Yeah, that's definitely the culture even even in my very
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.240]   Small open source projects like we had a very clear kind of policy like if you find a security hole
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   This is here's a private line that will get an immediate response from like if we don't respond within a certain amount of time
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.320]   And this is just common practice then you can you know reveal it or take it
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.520]   But yeah, that's generally what you do, but these these folks are employed by the government, right?
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.680]   I mean well celebrate the private company right, but I'm on contract
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.360]   I mean I just assume that they are gonna pay them to use their exploit right but as a technologist
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   In other words, they're making money from holding these exploits instead of giving them to the company is that ethical?
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.500]   No, it's not ethical. I assume that they were employed by the government previous to the like that they're on
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.160]   Not saying it's ethical. I'm just saying yeah, I don't think that they were like Apple government
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.120]   No, it's quite the opposite they were well now the way that FBI
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.040]   Suggested this in their court filing was somebody has come to us with a hack
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.320]   That's true, which would imply that somebody if it's celebrate would have said oh
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200]   You know, but they have worked with the government before
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.520]   They have exploits effect on their web pages says we can crack iOS 8
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   9 is a little bit more trouble
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:16.800]   But eight also had encryption full disk encryption so it sounds like celebrate mind of said hey, you know called their contact at the
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.040]   Dark Department of Justice said hey, we can crack it
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.960]   Why they didn't come forward sooner is another question my guess is because they had to try maybe they didn't know yeah
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   They had a they had a I'm guessing that anybody who wanted to do this had to replicate the situation
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.800]   And it's not clear that they can do this right
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.320]   they're testing this on phones that are in similar states as the as the
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.160]   The phones of the the attackers right because they won't want to risk deleting data. This is why they needed time
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.080]   Right, so this is all kind of I really thought I'd understand that the Justice Department did blink if they truly believed that
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.040]   They had the principle behind them
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.640]   They would have gone ahead in the case and said no Apple you just owe this to us because we're the government
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.600]   We're doing what's right instead. They blinked as well if we don't need you we won't ask you to do this
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.960]   Yeah, that's really interesting. It is it is
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.240]   Some legal authorities have suggested that if you're going to use the all-rits
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.000]   It is in coming on you if you have another method
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.560]   You legally have to use that other method all-rits can be used only if you know there's no other way than to use the
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.680]   Pay attention to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   It does kind of you know give lie maybe to my assumption that the government really wanted a wider precedent than just this phone
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.840]   If really what they wanted was a wider precedent. It's I mean it would be unethical, but they could have said
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:41.760]   Celebrate don't doubt that we like this case. This is a good one for us to go forward with there's also the possibility they may have
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600]   gotten advice
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.680]   From people the AC. I think was the ACLU
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   No, no, it was a Harvard professor pointed out that the Kalea
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.680]   explicitly says the telephone companies cannot be compelled to write software for the government taught the government in they're protected by Kalea
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.040]   So it may have been that the FBI and the Department of Justice
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.000]   On though at the 11th hour said you know, we're not gonna win this case. Maybe judge
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.080]   I don't let it go to lose. Maybe judge Pym said to them guys. I'm gonna rule against you
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.120]   Who knows who knows if we maybe we'll know in April 5th if they go back to court
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.080]   But that's the latest on that and it's it's been endless fodder for us
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   And I think probably in some ways it's a little disappointing that that it's gone with a fizzle
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.840]   No, no, no things and what happens with so say the hack works and they get into these phones
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.880]   I mean at one point and then what happens is Apple hire them to
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.280]   Close the the ethical issue, isn't it?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.160]   Yeah, yeah
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   Put some under NDA to the government
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   Right, absolutely, but now does Apple go off and try to hire other companies Apple who won't pay for hacks
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.280]   Hire companies to try to replicate the hacks so they know what it is so they can close it, right?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.960]   I have to think that Apple has lots of security companies kind of already trying to write it. I mean, yeah
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.800]   But yeah, it's troubling. It's the process Apple even says, you know, nothing is perfect
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.320]   There's no there's no technology that doesn't have flaws or bugs that might be used to exploit
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.520]   That technology and and this they said this in the Times article and that's why it's so important that
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.400]   Companies pay bug bounties that they go to hackers and courage hackers to say, you know
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.120]   Tell us first before you release this publicly so that we can fix it because there is nothing perfect, right?
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.680]   so it's
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.640]   Maybe a foolish thing for Apple to not offer these bug bounties, but I think that it's also a principle thing
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.200]   I don't think they want to pay it's like negotiating with terrorists
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.560]   But that that presumes that the person who actually cracks it is ill-intentioned if the intent is to say I'm trying to help you
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.880]   close
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.240]   Volcker abilities
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.960]   This is how they make money this is what they do they're a forensics company and often that's what it means is you use
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:08.120]   You look for zero days that will allow you to do the forensics on the phone and that's their that's their bread and butter
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.480]   That's that's their stock and trade. They're not gonna tell Apple that they don't want it to be closed thought to come up with a new one
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.680]   So that that's where the ethics. I'm kind of with you the ethics your little yeah, I agree
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.720]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   I do want to talk a little bit about Hulk Hogan because God knows who doesn't
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.080]   And yeah, we'll be playing that video a little later on
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   Is it isn't it newsworthy now yeah, so protected by the First Amendment
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.880]   Well, but that's that was caucus argument. There was then but we'll talk about it. Well, it's now
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:49.400]   I
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:59.080]   There is other things to talk about including I'm very upset with Google for one killing one more thing
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.120]   That they say nobody uses but I use I'm surprised you use it. We'll talk about it
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.480]   We'll talk about that when we come back our show today
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.920]   Not only brought to you by the great folks are CUNY and we thank CUNY so much for the studio and for the support
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.240]   And we're really looking forward to doing this with you guys. This is gonna be the fan rate
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:21.480]   Tastic but also by our friends at zip recruiter if you're hiring you know that
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:28.280]   The internet's a boon for this right it means you can reach out to a much larger pool of candidates
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   In fact, I think it's safe to say that the perfect person's out there somewhere your job as a hire or as a recruiter is to find them
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.960]   Well, how do you find them?
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.880]   There's lots of job boards. There's lots of social media. What do you do? What do you use?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   Let me recommend zipper cruters with zipper cruder you post once on the zipper cruder site
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   They cross post to more than a hundred job boards plus Twitter plus Facebook plus Craigslist

[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.920]   I don't know if I want I want to reach out to a million people
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.080]   What if I get a million resumes? No, that's good because the resumes don't come to your inbox
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.160]   The people don't call you on the phone
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.800]   They go into the zipper cruder interface where it's very easy for you to manage many many applicants

[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.720]   800,000 last time we talked was 400,000. It's very popular have used zip recruiter plus
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.560]   They also have because if you go to the zipper cruder site, you'll see they also reach out to job hunters

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   We got an email from Dan
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.160]   I think he heard about it on the show. He's a happy zipper cruder client
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.760]   He says the hardest part is a quote direct quote from the email
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:07.320]   The hardest part about running a business when you need to hire is that you have to spend extra time recruiting while you're short staffed
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.120]   But with zipper cruder, I've got quality candidates within 24 hours of posting a job

[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.600]   Google I
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.440]   Like the Chrome app launcher tell me about that
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   So you
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.720]   How do you feel about that?
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.560]   It was a little weird when they announced it and they've only been around for a year or two
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:00.160]   Yeah, the idea is if you've installed Chrome extensions and I do I use a lot of Chrome anybody uses a Chromebook has a lot of Chrome extensions
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.560]   The app launcher then and more than just on the Chromebook
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.240]   Because this really is valuable on Windows and Mac
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   It will put up an icon
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.720]   Like it's an app and they'll be the apps will be there and you can run them as if there's standalone apps
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.000]   Right, right so it's sticking around on Chrome OS right? They're only taking away from Mac Windows and Linux
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.320]   Yeah, and they say that nobody used it. Yeah, except that I did use it. You're no money
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.520]   So you absolutely need it on a Chromebook because that's when you press the search button
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.560]   That's that's where you're gonna get it's all apps and that's how you launch them right what they're telling Mac Windows and Linux users
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.960]   Is oh no you're gonna have to go to the tool bar to the you know
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.240]   Yeah, if you don't have an icon in the extensions you're gonna have to go through the manual process of go to going to more tools
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.920]   And extensions and running it from there. I don't think that's a good experience
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.080]   Why would they kill it and my real point I think is
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.640]   Google does is too much and I think it I think
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.480]   I've Microsoft has done this a little bit too, but they take a lot longer to give up on something
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.720]   I use this example windows media center which a lot of people use but they stopped developing in
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.680]   2009 and only just killed in Windows 10 so for seven years
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.600]   They didn't do anything to it, but they figured well, we're not gonna kill it Google
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:21.360]   It's kind of modern right what is it Facebook says move fast and break things. Yeah kill things fast
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   But I think that hurts them this is kind of an example. I mean listen
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:36.200]   Listen Google's a data-driven company if they're not seeing the use that they expect the critical mass of use
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.720]   Which has got to be a lot of use right?
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.800]   I mean they killed wave because it was like well, you know a million users not so much
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.240]   I'd go for a million years can't they afford to keep these things going they can but you know what why would you why even a company like Google?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   Why would you expand resources on stuff that people just aren't?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.920]   I'll tell you why because nobody trusts Google now because they keep thinking so
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.160]   I'm sure you're gonna be much less likely to go all in on a Google
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.520]   So if they were to watch another Google plus at this point, I mean, I've been burnt twice buzz
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.000]   Google plus I'm not gonna join in another Google. No one plus is still there Leo
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.320]   But I mean we're talking about communities versus a little utility in your toolbar, you know
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.000]   I mean and like don't most but they do doesn't matter that is what I'm saying is they don't care
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.440]   They'll kill anything community wave little toolbar utility doesn't matter and that's very engineering driven. That's very data driven
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.880]   That's very Google right. It's so Google of them. Yes
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.880]   That would be a good show that's so Google
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.720]   Doesn't everyone just have a browser open always and
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.720]   You know if you need to go to an app you go to it and the apps button is right here in the the bookmarks toolbar right there
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.280]   That's basically the app launcher, right? I guess I mean this this page functions just as well
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.320]   I know I'm not saying you're as you're talking you're saying what Google's saying right?
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.800]   I am I'm agreeing with Google on this
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.720]   I feel like if they don't have that if they don't have the users
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.640]   It doesn't make sense to support it. I wouldn't feel away if I love then use this
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.560]   The point is that there let's say it's only a million people but every time you do that right you hurt
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.680]   I think you hurt your brand and you show a lack of staying power that in the long run means people are gonna be less
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.160]   Likely to use your tools. I think I read that killing Google readers won't lead to Donald Trump
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.720]   Everything's being blamed for
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.560]   Was particularly painful
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.120]   Okay, so you don't care about this one right but you might care about another one. I just feel like it's a very
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.560]   Can't you know I guess what I would say to mr. Google if he ever asked me is
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.040]   Launch fewer things and stick with them
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:50.360]   Million things and kill a lot of them because they have no idea what people are gonna like and use I mean they I mean gee
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:57.040]   No, it's 20% project like I mean right you know, I mean they're big breakout hits you know, yeah news
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.680]   Thing I can't hear about Google is that is it is that it has just
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:07.360]   hordes of under-employed people they could keep a couple of guys working on what they do is so the other boy person
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.600]   Invents something new and then they kind of say, oh man
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.080]   They kill it. Yeah
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.160]   And is it just me? I mean, maybe I'm the only one who feels this way
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.920]   I just feel like it's not it's that it sends a message that is not necessarily good for Google
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.440]   They must be aware of this. They're smart guys. Yeah, yeah, but maybe they don't care
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.720]   I mean if they if they maintained everything that they ever launched and didn't do so well. We still have no
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:41.840]   Two more internal testing launch fewer things maybe right right maybe that's why they always said beta beta beta
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   Yeah, but that's that's that's that's what's all so we wrote a book about this. That's what's open
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.440]   That's what that's what makes them generous
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   And that's what gives us the in on on helping to them what products ought to be and if we tell them
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.200]   Yeah, we don't care that they listen to that too
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.840]   It's just impossible to predict what people are gonna love and use like what are the things that people you know
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.520]   I guess I was eager to predict there'll be a lot more to buy the ways they got to do something about Google Plus
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   I should post this image. I I
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.720]   I well
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.920]   So Google Plus is still good. I mean I still follow people there. There's some good people there posting a lot of stuff Mike
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.880]   Algan now that he's back on the road. He's in Cuba. He's posting there all the time and it's great
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.320]   I love it in fact
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.880]   I've been reading more Google Plus because of Mike's posts there, but I'm going along and they have a thing called hot topics that you don't control
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.800]   And I've mentioned this before you don't control what's in hot topics
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   It's just them intruding into your stream and in this case it was literally it was an anti-Semitic rant
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.480]   Yeah, and it had and I looked and I screenshot it so off to post it on Google Plus
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.400]   It had like three plus ones it had two comments and they said trending topic
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.800]   There's nothing trending about it and this has happened to me a number of times
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   we're really kind of
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.440]   It doesn't agree with my politics, but even but I mean any
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.080]   Semitism is is more than just not agreeing with my politics
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:05.680]   Fringy stuff, you know that I don't understand why Google is surfacing it if it had a hundred plus's maybe but it didn't
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:12.160]   They also have less data now. Maybe that may have something tuned to a lot of people using this guy posted
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.040]   I'm getting very few people. I mean, I mean, there's like four people I see now
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:24.000]   Plus feeds well, that's a way to kill it faster and faster. Well look there's an app launcher in Google Plus that might be
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.280]   Wow, that's good. Sorry just kidding
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.960]   But this is somebody I can't uncircle because I never circled them I can't get rid of it
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.400]   It's it's it's stuck into my feet. I mean, I mean, it's not I'm not a little shrinking file it
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.320]   I can see it and it's not gonna poison me, but I don't want to see it. I don't know all right enough of that
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   That's my personal problem
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.360]   Should be regular regular segment Leo's catch. No, that's your
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.120]   Ramp you can fetch. Oh, okay
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:02.560]   She fell you're gonna hug she's gonna hug her. Well, no, we're in New York. We're gonna do the show
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.240]   Everybody is afraid of
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.760]   That's exactly we got New York values. I can see that yeah
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.020]   Oh
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:20.780]   New York values, yeah, we know what that is renaming Chromecast to Google Cast. What does that mean? Why why why?
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.260]   I thought Google Cast was the name of the protocol
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:31.780]   I thought that it was like the technology behind the Chromecast so they've got a nice page if you go to google.com/cast
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.860]   It's just the it says neat Google Cast as if we have
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.620]   If we haven't met exactly it may be though
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.520]   They're they want to get beyond the little dongles to something
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.340]   larger well, they they wrote a really interesting piece about Vizio TVs and getting rid of
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.860]   the remote
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.300]   I'll be replacing it with an Android tablet
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:02.020]   But the argument is that that you just cast whatever you're watching and so maybe they're you know in his argument
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.940]   They're trying to re-in with Vizio. They're really reinventing the notion and the experience of television
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.540]   I like it that Vizio is acknowledging that maybe they're not the best software developers in the world actually Vizio's smart TVs are better than
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.020]   Sam songs, which are really I want they're great
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:20.300]   Yeah, the Vizios aren't bad. You know, and maybe that's that's why they want to make them even better
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:28.700]   But but requiring that somebody own and expensive they sell you with the TV it comes with it that that is just just Android
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.100]   I think it's lollipop, but that's interesting
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.340]   But it's it's so it's not just a remote so you don't get a remote with a new Vizio TV
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.100]   You get this instead and what I don't know is can I use my phone instead now?
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:46.820]   We should mention this is the p-series, which is they're horrendously expensive high-end TVs only make two models
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.780]   There's I think a 70 and a hundred and twenty inch and the
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.460]   Well, the big one is like over a hundred grams. It's like you buy a Tesla and you get a
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.540]   Yeah
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   So yeah, so that's that
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.780]   Maybe doesn't isn't something that they're gonna do well, but I think what it
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:12.260]   Remote as well as oh, I'm just I know it says that you know you could be using your your phone truly as a remote
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:20.100]   No, no, I think that's what's great about chromecast against what they're saying is you pick the app Google cast Leo Google cast
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.980]   I guess it makes sense to take the word Chrome out of it because it is
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:33.860]   Saying to me earlier it has nothing to do with with Chrome. Did you bring a happy meal? What is that? This looks like a happy meal?
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:40.580]   Oh, it says the CUNY graduate school of journalism. You you have your own cardboard. Isn't that cool? What are you gonna do with that?
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.140]   Well, we can watch more later
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.780]   Seriously
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:55.460]   So why is CUNY doing we're getting big into VR or one of our journalism one of our web the geniuses web video geniuses
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.740]   Asosososos is really learning a lot about it. I think that's exciting. Yeah, very cool. New York Times did that right?
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.740]   They distributed those with a sign anytime a few months ago
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:08.340]   Cardboard is funny because it's it feels like the porch stepchild of Google's you know
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.540]   I mean to Samsung's gear VR and then Oculus Rift which is
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:18.500]   $700 and and Vi which is $800 and this is 59 cents, but it actually works
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.620]   The most accessible
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.620]   You have a phone and a piece of cardboard and you get to you get to try it. That's a good gateway
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:31.460]   Well good good on you. What kind the needs of journalism and VR are very different because for one thing
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.700]   Um, there's no fourth wall. So the journalist or the camera operator is in the well
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.420]   That's the controversy with the New York Times. No the the the the the journalist steps out of the story
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   So the journalist is setting up the story. They're saying to the subject wait wait wait
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.260]   Stay on uh started them start packing your lunch in a minute and then disappears. That's a funnel like that
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.540]   I think uh, so one thing I was just so you should be in the shot. You're part of it
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.260]   To my colleague Bob. I was suggesting we should do kind of a how-to of how is it made so you see what happens
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.180]   And you have to do it ethically as opposed to staging it even starts early. I I think
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:10.020]   We've gotten a bunch of the Thedas which you used on your cruise on the on the yeah, I have it with me
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.620]   Actually, yeah, and and I think there's the opportunity there for journalists to start thinking in 360. I agree in immersion
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.700]   You know somebody else just did a 360 of an interview with somebody that makes no sense to me
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.740]   So we need to look behind me when there's nobody talking right no, um, it's gonna be a place to the space
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.140]   Right, so that's where I use I use on a cruise ship
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.580]   I was thinking about using we went down. I was very moving by the way to the 9/11
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.980]   Museum and memorial and I was saying I was going to use the theta there
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.540]   But then I actually thought better of it. It seemed inappropriate, but that's the kind of place where you think pictures are
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:45.060]   Um, do people think pictures there? Yeah, so there's a part of the museum that you can take pictures of and there's
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:51.700]   You know amazing stuff the last pillar, you know, they when they were cleaning out the rubble they left one
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.620]   Steel beam there to the very very end and people were covering it with names and memorials
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.860]   And then with great honor
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.340]   At the very end they took it down and they escorted it out and you know, there were salutes
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.300]   It's quite moving they have pictures of it. They're saluting as it goes
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.780]   And then of course they build a beautiful memorial. I know you guys both
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.340]   I know I can't do it. I have been able to do it
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.980]   I'm gonna do it. I just yeah, I just yeah
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.460]   I was saying to me that I should do it. We should be cathartic. We should hear this 15 years later
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.340]   Yeah, it's been it's been a while. I would like to go to one world trade and do that the elevator ride. I hear is amazing
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.340]   I heard that's amazing
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.660]   Maybe not Jeff. I'm gonna do it. I think it's one of the most
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.740]   Beautiful and appropriate memorials I've ever seen it's very difficult imagine
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.500]   How do you do a memorial and there was I'm sure a lot of debate about do we rebuild?
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   What do we do with this site? Yeah, and I think they did exactly the right thing
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.820]   Which is they didn't rebuild on the site. They built next to it this beautiful building right
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.420]   Was it one world trade center now? I said what's called trade is that?
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.900]   and but where the
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.260]   bases of
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.100]   one and two were
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.700]   Is a is a kind of a there's a hole in the ground and then there's a waterfall with a center point the footprints
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.780]   I've seen
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.900]   I'm going to that and then all the way around at the names and in many places
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   I wanted to take a picture again. I just didn't want it true
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:20.180]   So I felt I didn't do it, but there are roses and flags and memorials every time walking by I'm like can I do this right now?
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.980]   No, no, no, I'll do it later. I understand it's very hard
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:27.380]   So first time I shot if you're watching video at the top of it is the new building and then the two
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.460]   squares below that are this is Google Earth are
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.860]   The memorials and they're really my my response to the first time I went
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.740]   They had huge security it was worse than going to an airport to get in now. It's open
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.060]   But then it wide open very closed. Yeah, and that was disturbing. Yeah, what is what has happened to us?
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:51.060]   And I had an odd reaction this would be controversial, but for the first time I actually think that it's too big
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:58.180]   That it leaves the scar forever in the city and and and life goes on and things get built upon things
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.940]   You know look at ancient cities and for this to ever forever be hallowed ground
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.340]   It's it's like I don't really understand that the I'm not criticizing for a second
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.620]   But but putting a memorial on the highway where someone died
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.500]   That would be the last place I want to memorial to me
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.460]   Where I died. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, do it somewhere else. I mean I get it
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.540]   I understand it, but it's just not what I see so what we did was we said this is how low because people died there
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.580]   Well, yes, but they've died all over the city in various ways, right?
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:30.820]   And you can't lock off everything that had tragedy associated. We were walking by city hall on a course that was a notorious
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:37.700]   British prison camp during the revolution where many more people died and suffered for years
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.140]   Um, and now it's a park and it's not a memorial at all. I only knew that because of four square
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:52.500]   Fantastic
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.740]   I learned something so uh, I don't agree with you. I understand. I actually don't disagree with you
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.940]   Yeah, I'm not saying that I'm saying that I do it was a emotional reaction
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.180]   I can understand that completely totally legitimate. And yet it is a beautiful memorial
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.940]   And I think we need memorials in all sorts of places and it's a beautiful
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.140]   It's it's a really touching more and then next it is the museum
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.860]   Which I had seen the memorial before but I hadn't seen the museum
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:22.180]   And I know you guys haven't and that is something you will have to gird yourself for because it is very heart wrenching
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.540]   And there's tissues everywhere and people made it. I know it was
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.220]   But so you can take pictures of parts and I did take some pictures
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:34.740]   And then but then you go into an exhibit where you're not allowed to take pictures and that's where there's
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.940]   Sound and video and pictures and it's um
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.740]   It brings it all rushing back. So don't go there. I'm gonna block off a couple days for that. I think
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.860]   Yeah, so it's maybe it's time it's been a long time
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.180]   You know on the morning of the I was right in the path train
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.180]   Which is where I was in the morning around 11
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.580]   And I was right in on the morning of the Belgium attacks and it just it just kind of rolled back back
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.260]   Yeah, I was I was flat I had flashbacks
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.620]   To just seeing the faces on the path train that day, you know, I
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:06.420]   Have the same reaction to 9/11 and to this Belgian incident. I just don't understand people and why they do that
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.380]   I just I I understand the anger
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.980]   um that people feel as we bomb them with uh, you know, um
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.100]   However these were predators. Yeah
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.420]   Yeah, and they're in it taking innocent life
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.540]   I mean, I understand the anger, but I think we just need to stop all of this and
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.620]   And maybe truce and we can figure it out because it's just it's so sad. I fear we'll be the opposite way though
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.700]   Yeah, I think you might be right. Um, well I come to New York and you just have a ball
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.540]   Yeah, it's it's really yeah, well it's the first thing I did
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.340]   I wanted to do that. I actually do that a lot. I paid it
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.860]   I did. Yeah, it's good. Well, you did
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.060]   Almost every time I come to New York. I've actually gone to the grounds. Yeah. Yeah
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.220]   The first time I came was a month after 9/11
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:50.980]   And I went there and of course it was still you know, uh, there was it was all chain link fence and
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:57.060]   Pet plaster morals and even where have you seen my husband have you seen my son?
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:03.380]   And it was so I have a very strong relation to it. There is a smell to the city. Yeah, you can't do it
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:09.220]   Then they built a beached whale next to it, which is now that I think they could have stopped beach dead whale
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.220]   I thought the oculus was going to be beautiful
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.660]   But then you get to the scene and you have this beautiful touching memorial and there's whale bones
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.100]   There's a there's what is that the path station path station? Yeah, it is the it is
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:27.540]   I okay. I'm sure it's I'm not an architectural critic. No, I there it is going up. Yeah, it's it's
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.580]   Jonah where we walk in your Jonah. It's huge and that's the other thing is you don't realize how big that is
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:39.700]   It's giant. It takes over the site. It's like a whale died there and it's beached bones. It's bleached bones are still there
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   It's I don't get it
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.500]   But I'm not an architectural critic. It was going to in the original consumption
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:50.180]   I think it was going to open up to the air and close it does it seems like it has the movers or levers. It doesn't really open
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.220]   Oh, it costs more money. It costs enough as well as welcome back to this week in architecture
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:01.940]   All right, we have we're moving along here. We've got Tesla using a google glass
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:09.300]   To help build speaking of Tesla to build cars if anyone can find a use for that damn thing is
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.420]   Tesla is Tesla actually won't be google class
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.940]   Well, it's going to be from a company called
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.780]   Vuzix they're using glass and Vuzix
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.540]   At the Fremont factory
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.020]   They're comparing the platforms. So there will be a winner at some point, but it makes sense
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.140]   I mean you think of the Tesla's being built by robots, but they're humans
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:38.020]   Yeah, and this is a legitimate use case for glass like technology. I think so. And you know specialized
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.460]   Work like this. I would think it'd be more useful though and repair than in assembly. Yeah
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.340]   Assembly, you know what you're doing. Right. Let's just do it. Yeah, right flip the widget
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:55.860]   This is actually apparently a picture of a Tesla being made. I think you got that nine to five google
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.540]   From glass. That's a picture of a glass and you see the VIN number
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:05.620]   In the glass and you see details start repair get help. It's very interesting
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.100]   Very interesting
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.540]   Gadget hog in our chat room says that that design is a is a very typical of the architect calitreva who did it
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.500]   Yes, it is. He does that kind of thing. So they get as commercial as he is
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.700]   They knew what they were getting
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:27.220]   And the BCE center in toronto's built by him. That was yeah, that has that it's not whale bones, but it has the same kind of curvy
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.180]   shape interesting
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.740]   Moving along here google glass
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.180]   Albums in photos are smarter. I just you know I love photos. I just so
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.580]   Behind the scenes we took pictures of this set and stuff right before we started
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.940]   I copied the pictures to my lovely galaxy
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.420]   And
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.740]   Then I so now it's a google it's in it's in google photos
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.940]   Thank you to jake your son for taking those pictures by the way
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.100]   And i'm going to share them off
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.860]   To the studio and we probably have them up before the show's over another great use
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.100]   I tell you have google photos look at that. I could just share these as a shared album
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.140]   These albums are getting smarter. You can add maps locations and captions
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.940]   As well. So a new shared album
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:18.180]   I'm going to create a link and then i'm going to share it with email
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:24.900]   With jerry jerry you're going to get that pictures in the email. Let's see it. Let's see it. We'll do it in real time. See how it works
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.660]   Uh, what else google asked a thousand
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.660]   Go ahead you take this one
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:36.580]   Google asked a thousand British teenagers whether they wanted to start a startup and I think uh not many said yes
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.260]   Sorry most of them said no, I don't know what you're talking about only 22 of them
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.420]   Over a thousand
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   Ah, I don't want to start a startup
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.620]   22 percent sorry
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.980]   What do they want to do?
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   Or 22 percent? Well, that's not so bad
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.180]   That's not so bad
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.620]   If everyone wanted to start a startup then they'd be the way to hire just take your startup. That's true
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:04.340]   It is interesting though that these kids are like i'm going to be responsible and get a job at a stable company and not be so reckless
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.420]   But you know what jena
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.900]   It is even though even though you're still but but a pup
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.300]   Um
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.900]   How would you have felt about doing the startup you're doing now when you were 22 years old?
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.420]   Oh, I I wouldn't have done I would not have done it right so a lot of my girls students go get jobs
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.380]   Yeah, they learn they learn the business appropriate go get jobs
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:29.300]   But they still have the bug the virus won't leave them. It's like Zika and they then go start their company
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:35.460]   No, that's true. That's true. I always kind of consider myself a late bloomer and became more risk tolerant and more confident as I get older
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.460]   Which I don't know what that was about it in college. I would have never thought about although, you know
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.180]   When I talked to my nephews, I'm like have you thought about maybe start the business?
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:47.860]   You know like there's employers and employees kids like you want to be an employer, you know, I gotta give them my little speech
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.820]   Is it possible that some kids will do it just defensively because they can't get jobs
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:56.900]   I mean, you know, I think that's a lot of it. I think young people are are feeling
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   Um, let's ask the chat afraid of not being able to get jobs
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.620]   How many of you in the chat room would like to do a startup right now instead of getting a job
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:14.100]   Says p shops being an entrepreneur isn't the be all and end all of work. Yeah, that's true. It's a crappy job. Don't do it. Yeah
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.900]   It's tough you guys
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.940]   It's tough
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.500]   Yes
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.420]   No, it's hard being starting starting companies very very wants to slo-mo wants to
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.020]   Um, part of it is uh, is the the knowledge that most startups fail?
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.380]   Yes, yes
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.620]   If you asked a thousand British teenagers if they wanted to start a restaurant, they'd probably say no to
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:43.380]   Right and the reality is that most people who start companies have a safety net
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   They've got family right they've got, you know, they're healthy. They're in a good position. They have connections
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.420]   I mean, I don't know how many times I you know, I've talked to investors and they've said, you know, just like a little friends and family money
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:00.420]   And I was kind of like who do you think my family is like my mom is a public school teacher like there's what friends and family money, you know
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.540]   Uh, so there's there's that there's that well, most
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.780]   Entrepreneurs come from wealthy backgrounds or come from poor backgrounds
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:14.360]   I feel like people like Jason Callicannis was driven to being an entrepreneur, right? He he's a special psychological
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:20.980]   You know, kennis and I have actually debated about this because he's got this like perception of himself as being this like, you know
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:26.500]   Yeah, this scrappy kid who grew up in Brooklyn. Yeah, he grew up like a couple blocks away from me in a very middle-class neighborhood in Brooklyn
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:32.820]   Like and he went to the Catholic high school. Just like I did like we were not I was not I was very very not not poor middle class
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.140]   Yeah, Donald Trump thinks he was, you know, started under rough circumstances. He's only got a million
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.860]   I mean, you know self perception is a powerful thing. Sorry, Jason
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.900]   Most come from a background where they're willing to take risks whatever the economic background
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:56.020]   That may be true. I'll go have to be risk-telling, but there have been studies that are showing that most people who are most entrepreneurs have some sort of safety net, right?
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:01.140]   I mean, I did you know I did so I kept the radio job. I still have a quid it because I don't know if this twit thing's gonna work out
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.180]   Yeah, I know so well, so I last week I couldn't be on the show because I was at seabed giving a talk by the way
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.020]   How'd that go?
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:12.580]   Seabets strange because right seab it used to be the thing. It's the biggest conference in the world, isn't it?
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.700]   No, well because they lost all the gadgets to mobile room, right?
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.780]   Right and who buys PCs and all that kind of it's become like it's become like
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.100]   like a
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.300]   Condex was it's yes, it's all big iron and stuff like that
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.220]   But then what what matters there now the cloud. How do you show the cloud?
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:35.060]   Right Amazon came Amazon clake came with a big blow up cloud and you go inside and there you get a few desks, right?
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:42.100]   It's all back there in our mocks. So just imagine if you will
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.660]   Yeah, a bunch of servers
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.300]   So so with your European part of the reason they had me over is to you know kind of beat them up about about
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.460]   starting companies
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.700]   And the one thing I do say is that at least we in the US we have at least five times the venture investment of Europe
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.380]   Yeah, some estimates 10 times. Yeah, all five times. You're not going to get a google if you don't invest
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:07.540]   And and you've got to have risk the paradox here is the irony here. I think is that in Europe they do have safety nets
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.340]   We're not not that you could live on them entirely, but you can have health insurance. You can leave your job
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.380]   You can do other things your kids can go to college
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.340]   But there's a risk aversion especially in Germany but in in Europe
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.100]   Um, and I say at the same time. I think we've fetishized risk in the US
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:29.220]   I think when we would put a badge on you and say oh you failed it could be because you had a really crappy idea
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.420]   You did it badly right and maybe you should have failed you shouldn't drive
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:38.260]   Sometimes failures deserve yeah, yeah, but that's not the way we treat it in the US no
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.900]   Yeah, that's always been this this
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:47.700]   truism about Europe is that their failure failure keeps them from having this entrepreneurial spirit to me this BC spirit
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.460]   Yeah, I mean I can make unfair generalizations about Europe, but that's not one of them because they'll agree
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.340]   I think on the other hand we have fetishized
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.500]   the
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.100]   you know the
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:03.460]   the pull yourself up by our bootstrap story here that everybody can make it here and the streets are paved with gold and
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.900]   Uh and that and and the app economy is just another form of that fairy tale where well
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.540]   Anybody can write an app and thanks to google code engine or amazon web services
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:20.340]   Anybody can create a startup and it doesn't even it is easier than it ever was but I think it's also harder because everybody's doing it
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.900]   It's harder to succeed. Yeah
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.700]   Candy crush, but they can't right right no they can't no the app store is definitely not
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:34.340]   Yeah, so while we're just talking about abstracts so tech crunchy to piece this week arguing that the
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.140]   reported facebook messenger bot store that they supposedly gonna
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.420]   Announce it f8 is gonna be as big as the app store
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.580]   What do you think about bigger bigger here's what I would say
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:51.460]   Uh, well, well certainly what everybody's looking for doing bots is the next
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.340]   Look at who was it was it courts did an app
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.340]   Yeah, there was a news app, but it really wasn't a news app. It was a bot wasn't it?
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:05.620]   It was clearly a test case for how would news be delivered in a messaging context?
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.660]   Very proud one of our graduates in the entrepreneurial program has a very hot company out there now called purple
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:15.140]   Which which talks to you about the the election in uh sms
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.700]   So here's the here's conversational interface. Yes a conversational interface news information
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.220]   I can tell you how we got here
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:26.420]   So it's clear that the new platform the new screen is not the desktop the laptop the tablet
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:33.220]   It's the phone right that's that's if you're simply looking at hours of interaction. That's where all the interaction is normally known as a phone
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:38.580]   Yes, this this screen you think that people used to talk on as Bruce sterling calls it our glass lozenge
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.380]   so
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:46.100]   What is where if you if you want to get a piece of that it's about attention on the glass
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.180]   Screen right and the first thing was well you want to be the app on the front page
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.740]   That was it was all about that for the first couple of years was all about that right not so much so many more
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:59.700]   Next thing was notifications everybody's hot on notifications in fact look what facebook did
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.100]   That's one of the reasons facebook split off messengers to double the number of notifications
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.900]   Because how do people interact they swipe down or they I can't remember what you do on an iphone
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.540]   But you look at your notifications. It's been so long
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:18.820]   A whole week, but you look at your not if yeah your notifications swipe down. There's all you that's another way to get that screen attention
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.140]   But ultimately what is the what is the thing that gets your attention most often?
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:28.620]   What do you think you interact with most often on your on your lozenge is message friends right direct messages from bice
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.780]   So you're in messenger all the time, but what's going to happen is and we're already seeing this with products like slack
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:39.940]   I think yep, I'm saying that is the new inbox. It's as bad as your email was because
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:45.540]   It was only messaging was only great because no one used you know was just close friends and family
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.740]   but once everybody once courts is in there and
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.620]   And your delivery service isn't if once everybody's messaging you it says it's worse
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.020]   That's not your message box
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.740]   Does it replace google at some extent because you can ask questions that get more direct answers from a smarter machine
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.140]   That's what google thinks they think the search is going to messaging right right so
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.540]   And I have the only reason I think I have some insight is because I really went all in on telegram
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:14.500]   Which I really liked and telegram has had bots for a while. I even have a bot myself. So
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.820]   There's a leo bot. What does it do chief twitbot? Well, I'll show you it
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:24.340]   What do you think the leo it's called the mechanical leo, right?
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.660]   There should be there's gonna be a cavitch mode. So um
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:34.900]   The the last four posts were when I put an audio show up you get a notification leo is posted a new audio show
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.220]   I do it for audio not for video because I figure where you'll click that you'll listen and you continue on
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.700]   Right, um, I have also tied it to my car
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.140]   So when I pull up in front of the studio, there's a message leo pulled up. Let's go live. So that's
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.100]   This is like push RSS feeds
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.820]   It's really old
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.820]   Like friend feed
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.220]   When I vlog when I post on instagram
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.180]   You know it all goes into this mechanical leo now
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.620]   I would have thought that's it was just I was just playing with it to learn the platform
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:08.900]   Right. There's thousands of people subscribe to this really I can't remember the number, but it's over a thousand people
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.540]   What?
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.820]   So that to me was kind of an eye opener. Oh, okay
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:19.940]   But my instinct is that this is gonna go this is gonna have the same problem slack has which is it's going to be
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:24.660]   An inbox without any of the good controls that you have any email filters and all that stuff
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:31.860]   It's just gonna become jam. Here's a cyst bot. I can order flowers. I can get a ride food delivery. This is in a this is a chat bot
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:38.740]   Um food restaurant reservations hire a courier discover places event tickets book hotels get haircut and you do it by messaging
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.620]   The inspiration for this of course is we chat in china where that's what people do
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.820]   And I think that that might have had more success. I'm not sure why that had more success in china possibly
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.980]   Um because they were using less powerful devices maybe
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:58.020]   So messaging is in is a it's certainly easier to write a messenger bot
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.900]   Than it is to write an app
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:05.780]   Right. It's terrific. Well, well a messenger bot. Yes, but but an intelligent bot you can query
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.180]   No and a bot that can anticipate your needs and let you know of something
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.660]   Maybe a truer right? What do I get on my alerts all the time? So I have this brilliant
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.500]   colleague here at cuny named kerry brown who has our social journalism and
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.420]   It's very social
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.860]   So on facebook where you can say hey put this person on the top and always show you a top
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:31.780]   Well, she's constantly buzzing me right right right or face by the way watches now make this even more valuable, right?
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:36.580]   So facebook constantly tells me you have to interactions. Well, no really really
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.420]   I have new interactions. No
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.740]   First thing I do is turn off notifications and email
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.260]   But there are some notifications actually once so it's a notification system
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.540]   We've talked about this years of notifications are better than messaging. Yes
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:53.860]   And and one that is that that anticipates your needs right that is the hyper local news stream as Marissa may have said back in the day
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:58.100]   Right, um, but correct me if I wrong. How haven't we seen this kind of search
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.260]   For you. I mean, I mean I feel like aol messenger had searched
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.780]   Right, right?
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.820]   Well, there was a company that was old friends of mine started called smarter child
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.540]   Way back in the day that was on aol and you could ask your questions and you could go exactly
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.460]   Yeah, so everything old is new again or everything new is old
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:20.420]   But what's new here is that is the interfaith like the idea that i'm interacting with another being right like that
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.940]   I'm having a conversation versus like google now that right which I does a lot of like
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:28.740]   You know stories tailored for you and really can anticipate what you want without you having a query because you were already queried
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.740]   You searched right you did a google search
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.700]   But it seems like the you know the thing here is like i'm gonna
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.420]   Interact with this thing versus get these sort of soulless or you know these
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.540]   Push notifications from apps that are just like you have three new messages or here's something you might like today
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:48.180]   This is an area that I think I would love to see google try lots of new ideas
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.460]   And I think that's what now was about was the card interface and
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.780]   um, I think now on tap is another way of kind of experimenting with
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.300]   Well, how do people want to interact with information how they want information to arrive?
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.980]   Right, why is there green light coming out from behind your watch under your wrist?
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:09.540]   Probably it means my heart my heart is beating an unusual. It's behind. Yeah, what's got to go through my blood, right?
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.180]   That's how it's checking my i'm 69 beats a minute. I'm very calm. I see very calm. That's good
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.060]   For me in New York, you know, York relaxes me
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.660]   Times Square very chill. Ah so chill
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.180]   Um
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.060]   God two in the morning. They've got characters out there
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.940]   I don't even know but I I just I just love your advice is don't hug the other
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.220]   I tell the students that don't hug the other
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.500]   Cannot bring my toddler who it does it that okay
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.300]   They're not the cleanest looking Elmo's anyway, they get they get hung a lot
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.940]   Oh, yeah, because and then they can make money in the tips. Oh, I know
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.180]   No, I know the portrait is a good kid says Elmo Elmo
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:54.500]   Yeah, yeah, of course there's the day newtas. Yes. I didn't see any of those at two in the morning. They're cold. Yeah
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.300]   I saw Batman though. Oh, yeah
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.500]   Did you see the naked cowboy?
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.300]   He's been there for years
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:09.860]   He's got competition now though. There's other naked naked cowgirl. I think yeah, yeah, yeah, and he's by the way
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:15.380]   They're not naked. They're wearing underpants. That's awesome. And teddy whiteies. It's not very teddy whiteies. Yeah
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:20.260]   I'm sad to see uh, this is another thing google's giving up on robotics
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:25.940]   Yeah, did you see they're selling uh, though they want to sell Boston dynamics? I don't
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:31.380]   I'm not sure why but the impression I'm getting from reading these articles is it's a well
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.660]   This is what the Brad Stone called it a retreat from robotics
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.700]   I'm confused
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.060]   I'm too right it seems I seem like saying well Andy Rubin left
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.140]   You think that's how part of them it sounds like there were definitely some politics Andy Rubin left
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:50.420]   They struggled with leadership the the Boston dynamics wasn't interacting with Google's other divisions
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:55.860]   Sounds this sounds like this was a human problem versus and they're saying that this company didn't have revenue
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.260]   You know within the next three to five years, which what does Google care?
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.620]   Exactly. I thought that was the whole point about the
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.900]   amazing things
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:08.420]   I heard some the video of the guy being mean to the robot was their last ditch effort to prove to google how cool they were
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.060]   That was a mistake
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:16.100]   Google seemed concerned about the pr issues around
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.620]   People getting upset that robots gonna take over
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:24.580]   One of the one of the primary revenue streams for robotics is going to be military and police
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.780]   And google didn't pull back from that, but then you're you're hampering the company
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:33.460]   Well, Boston dynamics did have military contracts. Uh, google said when they acquired them well, we're gonna let those laps
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.340]   But apparently they didn't or weren't right able to
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.620]   uh, Brad writes in bloomberg business
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:45.700]   tensions between Boston dynamics and google partly was because they didn't want to work with google
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:49.060]   They were reluctant to work with google's other robot engineers now
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.020]   It's not clear if those engineers were robots where they were real people
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:56.500]   So Brad again when you're writing about robots is very important to me
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.060]   I want to say I imagine like the android statues
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:02.340]   Out on google's campus kind of like having it out with the
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:08.420]   But also part of the problem was as you said that there was no clear path to
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:12.740]   Monetization, I mean just didn't realize that was a concern for the other of it
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.100]   It seems strange to me because it did to me too
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:22.900]   Jonathan rosenberg who is an advisor to larry page and a former google senior vice president
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.460]   um said in a meeting
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:37.780]   Time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and that needs to be in a few
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.660]   Years it does seem like an unusually
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:47.700]   Non-googly thing to ask for so alphabet is running these companies within it right startups
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:54.420]   I have to think some of this also comes from it. This was the speculation sunday on twit a reluctance
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:56:00.020]   When you look at these videos, I think there might be some people at google said do we really want
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:07.300]   People to associate us with kind of killer robots. Is that really no that's maybe not the right
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.860]   Message to be saying right now people who are
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.900]   Already
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.740]   It's all screwed up world already struggling with trust you guys
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:23.140]   Actually springs a little bit true. I mean they've got to be a little bit aware of that
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.500]   But isn't a self-driving car robot there? Well, it is yes
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.100]   And that's the problem is that google has other robotics divisions. Yes
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:35.140]   Uh, we're getting some blips every few seconds on the stream apparently
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.100]   I'm hearing from our people back there in the front of them
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:43.460]   Is it possible for us to dial down the quality to improve the stream? Is that can that help can we do that?
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:47.220]   What do we think does
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.180]   They're going to do that. Okay. Thank you
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:54.660]   So yeah, quality is not as not quite as important because we're recording here
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:57:00.660]   We can send yeah, but also the most important thing is audio quality videos is secondary and and continuous
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.620]   Audio is probably the
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:09.220]   I don't know if I know that was just on certain importance. Yeah, we we actually Jason have a feed back in the stream here. So
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:12.020]   uh continuing on
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:17.460]   Uh, what do you think guys actually let me you look see what you want to talk about?
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:21.860]   All right, you have you haven't installed in yet. I'm just I did on my other phone. Oh, okay
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:27.940]   Nutroll yeah and ready. Yeah, I finally got to use for my old nexus six. Oh, this is your secondary phone
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.020]   Okay, I was gonna say on your
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.180]   Pixel no no because it's a little it's a little it's a little spicy
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.860]   And I haven't had any problems. Really I have it on my pixel and my 6b
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:43.300]   I put it on I put five on the phone too. And so I went to Europe last week. Yeah, how that work out pretty well
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.460]   I got because because
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:53.220]   I'm on AT&T unlimited. I can't use this as a high spot right so I could do that in Europe right
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:58.020]   Very slow. Well, no, come in at 3g sometimes. I mean 4g sometimes really yeah, I'll be
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:07.300]   For free. Yeah. Well for the data charge, right? Yeah. Oh, that's right with okay. So with T mobile. It's free free free free
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:12.020]   Yeah, I don't it might count against your data cap. That's oh, okay, but at that speed
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.260]   I don't think it's something to worry about. I feel like at some point
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.460]   That's one of the things is weird about google 5 as you pay as you go
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.700]   So you don't you don't get a bundle of
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:24.020]   Bits to begin with right right um it works fairly well good
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:27.060]   We'll talk a little more about nut job
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.460]   Uh in a bit
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.340]   I
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:40.580]   That rolls my favorite nougat Nutella everybody thinks it's gonna be Nutella. I don't know
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.380]   That's a brand name. Yeah, they're not gonna do it again
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.820]   Uh I am I have to I feel terrible about this
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.540]   I did not bring the snacks
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.620]   And now I have to do a nature box ad and now we're all gonna suffer we are
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.780]   Should have brought some of your homes as you sent me nice enough to send them to me
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   Uh google android nature box. I bet they make a deal. I bet they make a deal. Yeah

[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.820]   The happy box has arrived at my house nature box is a happy box
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:01.780]   This is a new one. I haven't tried the guacamole bites. Oh, is there avocado in the
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.500]   Super easy you fill out your snack profile you get personalized recommendations
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.780]   Well wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:10.620]   Your snack profile, I have a snack profile.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.540]   Just everything!
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.640]   Well you might say I want more salty than spicy.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.300]   And spicy or more sweet.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.260]   They can have a messenger bot that I can ask for.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.480]   That'd be nice to interact with your nature bot.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.340]   Oh, that'd be nice to interact with your nature bot.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.540]   I want to share my snack profile on Facebook.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.380]   Thanks.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.380]   I want a nature bot.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.800]   They don't-- look, you should need
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.620]   anything you don't like if you get a snack.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.120]   And because they want you to experiment.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.900]   And you say, well, you know, I'm not a jalapeno guy?
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.700]   No problem.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.060]   They'll replace it in your next box for free.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.580]   So it's just great all around.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.820]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:42.620]   And we're going to get you 50% off your first box
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.420]   of delicious and unique snacks without any of the junk.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:52.300]   50% off naturebox.com/twit.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.620]   What was I thinking?
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.900]   Why did I not bring a nature box with me?
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.460]   I know, sure.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.700]   Oh, man.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.500]   Android N has a free form window mode.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.860]   At least I've been reading about it.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.220]   I haven't been able to make it happen.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.620]   You know, kind of like a computer,
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.540]   like with windows floating and stuff like that.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.300]   Article by Ron Amario in ours, Technica,
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:21.180]   he says, you know, it's in the code in the developer documents.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.660]   But apparently, there's a way to do it.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.780]   So I don't--
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.020]   I don't have your end with you.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.980]   Hey, Jake, can you make me the other phone for else?
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.020]   To me, this is about the Pixel C. Because then you have--
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.740]   Yeah, but that's not a operating system, right?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.460]   Even better than a Chromebook.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.780]   The mode has to be enabled.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.620]   Once it's enabled, you'll see an extra button
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.780]   on the thumbnails in the recent apps screen.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.300]   So you hit the thumbnail button, you get the recent apps.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.780]   To the left of the X button that pops up after a second or two--
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.300]   this is Ron's-- says this.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.260]   There'll be a square shape.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.740]   And that will be-- you press the square symbol,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.060]   and you'll be whisked away to a screen showing that app
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.660]   in a floating window on top of your paper.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.300]   But the windows aren't floating above the Android desktop.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.540]   The background is blank wallpaper
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.620]   without any of your icons or widgets.
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.700]   So it isn't exactly like windows.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.020]   You just see in a floating app world.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.540]   And you can drag the apps around,
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.820]   and they have closed and minimized.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.980]   You can resize the window.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.620]   Apps will auto switch between tablet and phone layouts,
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.300]   depending on the size of the screen.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.860]   That's one of the things Android has a real advantage with.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.980]   You're an Android developer.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.980]   Yes.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.340]   I'm going to be contrarian, though.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.220]   I don't want this.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220]   You don't want this?
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220]   I don't want this.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.220]   I will not for my phone.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.740]   So this won't be enabled for a tablet anymore.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.780]   I mean, maybe for a tablet.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.180]   You know, I like that Android is a single tasking.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.460]   I don't want it using up some cycles or battery
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.820]   to do this kind of thing.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.860]   This is a computer mode for me.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.820]   On a tablet, though, this would be awesome, wouldn't it?
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.860]   I guess.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.340]   I don't know.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.660]   It works with a mouse even.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.100]   You can even plug a mouse even.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.100]   Oh, hey, why?
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:01.580]   Why?
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.180]   You don't have to turn it on.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.620]   OK, well, that's bad.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.140]   That's bad.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:05.660]   Shoot.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.380]   I didn't even like key.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.820]   Oh, so I'm going to be bad.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.900]   We may never see this.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.580]   I know.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.500]   I think you're my key.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.620]   All right, here he comes.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.060]   And the split screen mode as well.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.940]   Yeah, I use the split screen mode already.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.540]   And on the Pixel C, it actually really--
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.580]   I mean, OK, I don't use it for anything.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   But I could use it.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.020]   You know what?
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.340]   Actually, I'm coming around to your way of thinking.
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.620]   Even though I have this capability,
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.820]   I don't-- what am I going to do?
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.220]   I have YouTube open, and then the chat room.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.180]   Well, no, here's where--
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.660]   I need to worry about the little--
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.940]   Sweden's green thing, picture and picture.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.860]   The one thing I can imagine is not
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.740]   that you just have multiple things open so they're open,
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.540]   which is what you do with tabs and all that.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.060]   Right.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.620]   Though the truth is, I'm a Chrome user for so long.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.820]   I don't have multiple windows open.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.820]   I have tabs.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.700]   Right, tabs.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.340]   That's what I have.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.220]   Which is basically switching between apps, right?
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.300]   I mean, it's a full screen.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.540]   It's a little better than on the--
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.980]   I have to go back to the thing.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.820]   Yeah, recent.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.180]   But I can see in some cases where I want to think--
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:04.020]   I want two things on the screen so I can copy one or the other.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.860]   Yes, copy and pasting from one app to another.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.980]   So back in the day, children.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.580]   That way back in the day when I worked on my ATEX system
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.220]   at the Chicago Tribune, or maybe the San Francisco
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:20.540]   Examiner SII system, you had multiple save get keys.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.620]   This is something that--
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.620]   I'm amazed the industry has never had this.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.220]   Rather than just one simple memory for save get,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.460]   you could save that to A and that to B and that to C.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:29.980]   That's me.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:30.980]   And it returns to it.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.860]   So then you came back in.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   So it's like the days of links and stuff like that.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.820]   I want to go save these five things.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.020]   I come back and I can save to one,
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.580]   save to three, so you have to force it to five.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.180]   That's a very unixy thing to do.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:40.580]   That is.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.080]   That is.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:41.580]   Any Macs will do that.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.740]   There are some clipboard apps that will have--
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:44.740]   We'll save like your--
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.500]   You should use the Macs.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.260]   You'd be happy with the Emacs because you have buffers.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.340]   You have many infinite buffers.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.260]   And you switch it to buffer to buffer.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.940]   So the problem is that I want to move things back and forth,
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.140]   right?
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.740]   And I can't.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.940]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.900]   Now that I read the method, it doesn't--
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.260]   we just wasted Jig's time.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:00.820]   We did?
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:07.380]   Because step one, flash a custom recovery like Torp.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.540]   You want to show Gina how it works?
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.020]   It's early.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.260]   Yeah, I'll show you.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.020]   So the key--
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.700]   We don't have the old-- sorry, we don't have the old--
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.100]   over the shoulder camera yet, folks.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.820]   The key is you have-- yeah, right.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.780]   Just imagine.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.460]   This is like--
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460]   Mike--
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.180]   Microsoft had an event where they had a guy who was great.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.820]   He was doing this demo of Windows 10.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.420]   It was really cool, except they never showed his screen.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.740]   So all you see is this guy going,
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.540]   it's great.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:30.620]   Oh, I didn't do that.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.420]   It's really great.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.620]   That's about what we're going to do right now.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.220]   So I think once I'm in recents right,
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.580]   I press and hold the recents button.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.700]   And it turns into a hamburger.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.180]   No, I can't remember how you do it now.
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:42.900]   I can't remember either.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:43.420]   I was--
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.620]   I'm not going to remember.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.820]   The notifications on are really nice.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.580]   I-- they've rolled up notifications.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.140]   So all the notifications for any given app are rolled up
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.140]   into one notification.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:53.620]   Yeah, very.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.140]   You can expand it.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:54.660]   More.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.180]   I do.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:55.940]   I love that.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.180]   Not enough delineation between each group,
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.100]   but whatever.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.820]   They'll tweak the design for my taste.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.380]   But yeah, I really like the rolled up notifications.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.860]   So what you're going to have to do here
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.220]   is you're going to have to enter the ADB shell
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.340]   and just type the CD slash systems at C permissions.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.980]   And then you need to use set.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.740]   You're familiar with set.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:13.260]   I'm good.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:13.780]   I am.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.260]   OK.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.780]   Porjida tried to talk me through installing Unix
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.140]   on my first Chromebook.
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:21.740]   I remember that.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.660]   Oh, that's right.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.740]   Was it a cronut?
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.240]   What was it?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:24.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.740]   The other thing.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.740]   I'm always in my room.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:40.740]   San Francisco.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.740]   Is that they get a lot of the tourists.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.740]   The tourists go to a city that's never--
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.740]   Right.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.740]   Never go to.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   We just put you down a fisherman's warff
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.740]   so we don't have to sit here.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.740]   And you're going to square and all that, right?
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.740]   So that's what cronuts are.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.740]   We faked you out.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.740]   The tourists go standing in line there.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:55.740]   Like idiots.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:56.740]   No New Yorker would have croned it.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   I would have croned it.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.740]   I would have croned it.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.740]   Times Square is a little bit of that.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.740]   There's a lot of it in that.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740]   Not south of 40th Street.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:05.740]   Where we are.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.740]   That's true.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:07.740]   Fair enough.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   Fair enough.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.740]   What do you think of Google Now's, Google Now's new, more natural voice?
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:20.740]   I have a direct voice.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.740]   So I listened to this video.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   I did not hear a difference.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.740]   I did not.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.740]   They said it was subtle.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740]   I had so subtle that I did not hear it.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.740]   Is it--
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.740]   Is it like the change that road, not according to how it is?
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.740]   It's rolling out.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   So there's a video in the article.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.740]   I don't know if it's Android Police, but where it's purportedly,
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.740]   allegedly, the new voice.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   I watched it.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   I didn't get it.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.740]   Okay, Google Now.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.740]   I got your phone responding.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.740]   Okay, Google.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   Yeah, stop it.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:41.740]   I'm talking this phone.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   Sorry.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   No.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.740]   Oh, now I'm really screwed up.
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   I'm talking to this phone.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.740]   Okay, Google.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.740]   Who is George Washington?
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.740]   Here is some information about George Washington.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.740]   That sounds different.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.740]   Or maybe I'm imagining it.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   You're imagining it.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.740]   Listen, this is your work.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740]   So you hear things that maybe I don't hear.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.740]   That sounds different.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.740]   Did it sound different?
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.740]   Okay, Google.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   Okay.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:13.740]   How tall is Larry Bird?
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.740]   Larry Bird is six feet, nine inches tall.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.740]   Yeah, it sounds like a nicer person.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   Okay.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.740]   Doesn't she?
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.740]   Okay, Google.
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.740]   Who is Leo Laport?
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.740]   Oh, you didn't get a voice response.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.740]   What?
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.740]   I missed a phone.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.740]   Did you use together?
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.740]   Yes.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.740]   This is the rule.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.740]   It's weird.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.740]   At some point we're Googling ourselves.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   Like that's everything.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   See, they kill good things.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   I guess the show is dead now.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.740]   No more than this.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.740]   Google.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:52.740]   You can't screw with the boss.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.740]   The Amazon Echo knows who I am.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.740]   But you've got the knowledge.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   You've got the Alexa.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:57.740]   Who is Leo Laport?
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.740]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.740]   Dr.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   Mom's going to kill you.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   Oh, man.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   That's really disheartening when that happens.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.740]   Oh.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   God.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.740]   They used to tell my whole biography.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.740]   Oh.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.740]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   You still --
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.740]   You still mean a lot to us.
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:23.740]   By the way, Unix is spelled unixy, not e-u-n-u-c-h-s-y.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.740]   Okay.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.740]   Just I want to make that clear when I'm talking -- I'm talking the operating system.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.740]   Not the castrati.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.740]   I sounded like that voice was different a little bit.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.740]   But maybe it could be imagining that.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.740]   I think you're imagining it.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   So, I think they fool with you.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:45.740]   So I'm at an event last week about the trust project, which Google's helping out.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:47.740]   And the wonderful guy who's the product --
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.740]   The trust project.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.740]   I'll tell you about the second.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   Okay.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   So the wonderful guy who's product guy for AMP is there.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.740]   And I'm trying to demonstrate AMP on my phone to people.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.740]   And I'm getting -- I'm not getting AMP content.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.740]   I'm slow.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:01.740]   I said, "What the hell am I?"
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.740]   He said, "Oh, there's an AB test."
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.740]   Oh, and you're in the B.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.740]   All the people in the world, I'm the guy selling AMP more than anybody on Earth.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.740]   And I don't get --
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.740]   And maybe --
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.740]   -- on your browser.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.740]   You don't get it or where are you not getting it?
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.740]   He had me open up a -- you know what?
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   Boom, there I got it.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.740]   Oh, so I had -- I don't -- I want to see this.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:20.740]   You ever seen AMP work?
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:21.740]   I don't think that I have.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   What?
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.740]   I mean, I -- I have to do it.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.740]   Okay, so do a search for Obama.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.740]   Okay.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:26.740]   But don't do it -- you can't do it on your desk.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.740]   I'm not going to do it on mobile.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.740]   Okay.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:33.740]   That's why you haven't seen it.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.740]   Here's my phone.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.740]   G.L.C. and I'm on here.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.740]   So -- because I'm in the A on here.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.740]   Yeah, sure.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:38.740]   My phone's charging on this.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:43.740]   Okay, so you can see that this -- by the way, this is still the problem I have with AMP.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.740]   I agree with you.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.740]   I agree with you.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.740]   Now AMP results are way up above normal results.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.740]   This is an AMP carousel, right?
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.740]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.740]   So you know it says AMP there?
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.740]   So click on one of them.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.740]   So I'll click on BBC News, Argentina, Dirty War.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.740]   It's Bing because it's already loaded.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.740]   It's Bing.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   That's really fast.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.740]   Sorry, I said Bing.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:00.740]   Sorry, you can't see this.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.740]   They have a typewriter here named Bing.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740]   What is this blue bar action?
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.740]   This means that we're --
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.740]   That's where they're going to be.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.740]   They're going to be carrying yourself with Google.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.740]   The Google copy.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740]   And that's hosted on Google?
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.740]   Well, it doesn't have to be.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.740]   But it can be cashed on Google.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.740]   It can be cashed on Google.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.740]   It can be cashed on Google.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740]   You can free CDN from them.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.740]   Oh, we're going to get -- the chat room is going to go nuts.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   We're going to get back into AMP and Leo's --
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.740]   Oh, sorry.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.740]   I didn't want to tell you.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.740]   Oh, you know what?
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.740]   I've come to terms with AMP.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.740]   I'm okay with AMP now.
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.740]   Until we do one more voice.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.740]   It's one more thing to me.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.740]   I have to suffer from a Google.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:32.740]   Better words than instant arguments.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   One of the reasons I've kind of gotten over it, I wasn't clear, but I've really verified
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.740]   this for myself, that AMP is compliant in the sense that if --
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:46.740]   So I didn't like, for instance, that it doesn't use the IMG tag for an image.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:49.740]   It uses AMP dash IMG, right?
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.740]   But the way it handles it is browser invisible, right?
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.740]   So it's in a CSS extension.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.740]   So your browser still will use the image tag if you're not an AMP land.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.740]   Right.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.740]   And so I don't have as much problem with that.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.740]   That's just using CSS in effect.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.740]   Right.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.740]   I still don't think it's -- I still think it's a little bit of a power grab from Google.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.740]   And I really don't like it that if you want to be at the top of Google's mobile search
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:16.740]   results now, you have to be an AMP.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.740]   I think that's not right.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.740]   Google's just a standard for speed, and however you get to that standard, you should be able
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   to be there and be promoted as being fast.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:25.740]   Yahoo!
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:30.740]   You know, I search for -- Obama, I get a Yahoo! news story which I think is not AMPed.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.740]   No, in fact, oh, that's nice.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.740]   It pushes me to an app for Yahoo!
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.740]   Install the Yahoo!
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.740]   Install.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.740]   But then there's the carousel, and I have to go now below the carousel, below the knowledge
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.740]   graph, below the profiles.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:45.740]   This is all Google content, and now here's a search result.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   I agree.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.740]   And then Twitter.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:53.380]   And then the rest of the search results, which used to be the Wikipedia, the Atlantic,
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.380]   Politico, those used to be on top.
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.100]   If I were at the Atlantic, I'd be peeved.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.620]   Because, well, it's not AMP content, sorry, Atlantic.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.460]   The other problem is that if the Atlantic does have, and that list wherever it is, an
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.900]   AMP page, the blue link doesn't send to it yet.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.060]   I'm not following you.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.820]   Blue links don't send to AMP yet.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.820]   Blue links meaning in the regular search results.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.820]   Oh!
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.820]   So just the case.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.820]   Just the case.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:22.640]   And AMP is a standard that Google has authored, right, that anyone could implement anyway.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.540]   And if a page is amplifying, then it's fast.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.940]   If you're amplifying, yes.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.260]   Right, so talk, tell me about the Power Grab.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.740]   You feel like Google is...
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:36.180]   Well, that right there is Google using its monopoly in search.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.420]   To encourage re-authoring of tags, right?
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.420]   Well, no, no.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.420]   I mean, yes.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.420]   It's a favor.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.420]   It's a favor.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.420]   It's a Google technology.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.420]   It's a Google technology.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.420]   It's a Google standard.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.260]   Right, I understand what you're saying.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.260]   But if I'm doing a regular website, which I am, and I don't go all in on AMP, I don't
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.780]   show up until several scrolls down on the search result.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   Right.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:59.780]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.180]   If you're in the Atlantic, I'd be a little peeved.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.820]   That's pressuring the Atlantic to buy the Google.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.700]   I mean, you're not forcing people to use Google.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.180]   I mean, Google defines the standard.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.140]   It's the same as like robots' attacks, right?
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.020]   Google has meta tags.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.180]   They have suggestions for how to write these things, which everybody does.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.140]   But it doesn't affect search results.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   That's true.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.540]   I mean, they're argument, and I don't know.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.780]   Their argument is we know these pages are fast.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780]   Right.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.180]   We know these pages are going to be a great user experience, right?
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180]   So we're doing it for...
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:31.580]   Initially, it doesn't gain anything intrinsically by someone else implementing the ad tags.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.580]   Yeah, it does.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.580]   Well, okay.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:34.580]   So here's why Google does.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.740]   Because what it is is a response to ad blocking.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:43.780]   So normal users, once the web got bogged down by crap ad tech, said, "We'll screw that.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.060]   We're just going to block ad tech."
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.060]   I don't want it.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.380]   That's screwing me up.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.620]   And that, as an ad tech company, terrified Google.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.620]   I see.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.820]   So they said, "Oh, well, in lieu of using ad blockers, what if we made the web fast anyway?"
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.500]   What if we gave you fast ads?
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   Right.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500]   Right.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   So that's in their interest, certainly, to encourage fast ads.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.380]   Definitely, in their economic interest.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.740]   And they're using, in my opinion, and I'm not going to testify in any court case on this,
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.220]   but in my opinion, they're using their monopoly.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.580]   This is exactly what antitrust laws protect against.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:20.380]   They're monopoly in one arena search to leverage business in another arena, in this case advertising.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.020]   And they do it all the time.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.780]   They do it with YouTube.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.780]   They say they don't.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.580]   But anyway.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.780]   I think we need a faster web.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:29.780]   I think we rule.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780]   We'd be a standard.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.780]   I understand that.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.820]   That Google put out a standard because nobody else put it out.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:41.660]   However, in the implementation, yes, they were, I think, a bit deaf to the implications.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.420]   Now, what's happening, I don't know if you saw this.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.740]   I don't have a rundown.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:50.220]   But the moment, I think it was, put up a very detailed review of how instant articles is
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:53.540]   working for them and how they've not lost traffic.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.340]   And they're getting more on Facebook, but they're not lost and how it works and how
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.340]   monetization is working with all this thing.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.340]   Which publication was it?
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:04.340]   Well, my pronunciation is down.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:09.140]   And so I think the same thing is necessarily with AMP to really get some numbers back and
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:10.540]   find out what's happening to the publishers.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.100]   And when I've talked to publishers about this, they say, you know, jury out.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.660]   We'll see how this affects our business.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.100]   We'll see how it affects our traffic.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:22.300]   But generally, it is for them to the only weapon they have against ad blockers.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.460]   To speed up the AMP pages.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.460]   No, I understand that.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.020]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.700]   That blocking obviously is bad for a lot of content creators.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.940]   So, yes, this is becoming this week in AMP.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:37.940]   No, we're done.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.340]   Do you want to talk about Facebook?
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.340]   Sure.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:45.860]   Facebook joins WhatsApp and dropping BlackBerry support followed by without Facebook.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.580]   One took them so long.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.420]   Without Facebook, your smartphone platform is dead.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   That's bad about talking about.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.420]   Those two articles.
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.420]   It's kind of a one, two punch.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.460]   You and Spence, who's great.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.220]   I like you and I follow them.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:05.220]   Writing for Forbes says the news yesterday, Facebook is dropping support for BlackBerry.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.620]   10 shouldn't come as a surprise.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.420]   But it's the death now.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.660]   We know this from Windows Phone.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:18.940]   If your app is not on the platform, and it's that people want, they're not going to use
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.940]   the platform.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.140]   And I think that's really what hurt Windows Phone was the lack of, you know, Instagram's
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:25.020]   there now, but it wasn't there for a while.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.940]   A lot of things aren't there, including my bank's apps, aren't on Windows Phone.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:34.300]   But BlackBerry 10, I mean, even BlackBerry started, has moved to Android.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.060]   Why would anyone buy Windows Phone?
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:44.340]   Actually, HP is making a very interesting product, which is a Windows Phone.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.220]   They announced this at Mobile Oil Congress that uses Windows Continuum Technology to turn
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.380]   into a laptop.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:54.180]   They even sell kind of an inexpensive laptop like docking port.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.620]   So you can imagine in the enterprise, instead of issuing you a computer, I'll issue you
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.620]   this phone.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.620]   They forget a song.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.620]   And then you have at your desk, you know, your home office, you have one of those docking
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.620]   stations.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   And at the remote office, they have docking stations.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.140]   As soon as you just issue a little pendant that you wear, it's a computer.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.140]   Right.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.140]   It's a step into that direction.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.140]   Right.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.140]   So it's a corporate phone.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.140]   It's a corporate phone.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140]   I can't imagine.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   I can imagine.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.540]   Unless you're just a Windows fan, I can't imagine as an end user you're saying, "Oh, I want
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.540]   Windows Phone."
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:26.580]   On its day, it was very impressive, but it's become less so over time.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.220]   You know, frankly, I still wonder why people like you use an iPhone.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:30.220]   Oh, you don't use an iPhone.
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.220]   No, you don't.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.220]   You use an iPhone.
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.220]   No, no.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.220]   No iPhones on this show.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.220]   No.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:39.340]   It's funny because I had to use, I did use an iPhone for quite some time when the 6S+
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:40.340]   came out.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.340]   I had great battery life.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.100]   I've been using it since it came out in November.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.860]   And I was using the Apple Watch with it.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:50.340]   But as soon as the Galaxy S7 came out, and I started using it, I went, "Oh, I forgot
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.340]   how good this is."
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.340]   This is a --
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.340]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.820]   Yeah, no, we should talk about this is Facebook.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.220]   Yeah, this is a Facebook story.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.460]   It's a picture that you wouldn't see on Facebook unless you're a friend of a woman giving birth.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.300]   She posted it on her -- is this the full picture?
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300]   No.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.300]   There's more.
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:11.300]   There's a graphic picture.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.300]   She's giving birth.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.300]   But you know what?
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.300]   It's a beautiful picture.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.300]   It's a beautiful picture.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   It's messy, you guys.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300]   And it was for her friends, right?
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.300]   It was for friends and family.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.300]   It was a small group.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.380]   Is it a birth group in New York?
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.100]   It's actually, as I see it, an amazing picture.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.100]   It is really amazing.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   Facebook, birth.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.220]   Facebook went into her -- what she thought -- this was her mistake -- was her -- don't
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:34.220]   keep scrolling down, Jason, because it does get graphic.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:39.860]   But what she thought was her private group and took it out.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.580]   But of course, a little reminder, it ain't your private group.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.580]   It's Facebook.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:45.580]   It's Facebook.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:50.580]   And their orthodoxy about nipples is just amazing to me.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.820]   Haven't they given up, though, on the breastfeed -- they don't block breastfeed anymore?
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.340]   I thought that that had changed.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.340]   I think they changed.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.100]   I thought they sort of had loosened up on that.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.220]   This is extremely graphic.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.220]   She's giving birth.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   But you know, you see the umbilical cord.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.220]   It's called life.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.220]   I think it's a beautiful picture.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.220]   Yeah, I do.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.940]   I follow several trans -- like female-to-male trans folks on Instagram.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:15.060]   And so before top surgery, all their photos are like this.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.060]   And afterward, same person.
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060]   Isn't that sad?
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060]   That says something.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060]   Doesn't that say something?
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060]   Yes.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.060]   It's amazing.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   But that's the world we live in.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.580]   It is Facebook's platform.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.540]   It is not a public platform.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.540]   No, that's true.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:31.980]   And I think in a way, these things are good to remind people you're not -- as much as you
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.020]   might think, it's not a public service.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.700]   This is a private company.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:36.700]   And --
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:45.020]   Now, Google Photos -- I wonder what Google Plus's -- and what Google Photos is true.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.660]   And it's truly your space and your photos.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.740]   They would never, I don't think, remove a photo from your Google Photos.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740]   That's your private stuff.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.660]   On the other hand, Google Plus, they do have rules.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.180]   And there's -- they're a little more flexible.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.660]   There's got to be a lot of body parts stored up in the private Google Photos.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:07.060]   But as Facebook points out, most of the time a picture won't be pulled unless somebody
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.060]   complains.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.060]   Right.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.260]   They don't have the manpower to go through all those things.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.260]   Right.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.460]   Well, they have -- no, you can use lots of it to find it.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:20.460]   The AI is getting very, very good at recognizing photos.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.220]   She wrote -- she was a teacher, a lactation consultant.
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.500]   She was blocked.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.180]   Facebook message -- she says, "showed me the picture," said, "it violated Facebook's
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.180]   standards of nudity."
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.340]   Then went on to talk about how some photos are sexually explicit.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:38.420]   This is not -- it then prompted me to remove any other photos that contained nudity.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.060]   The two on the prompt screen were me wearing my baby in a carrier fully clothed.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.900]   That's what's wrong with these automated systems.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   This is flesh.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:49.540]   It's not necessarily easily detected after she affirmed that none of her other photos
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.540]   contained nudity.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:55.820]   She was a back -- allowed back on the site and the group.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:01.060]   I don't know what to say about that, except if you want to have a private group, you should
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.580]   do it somewhere else than Facebook, maybe.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.580]   Yeah?
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.580]   I don't know.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   It's difficult.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.580]   It's tough.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:08.580]   It's tough.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:10.580]   This is tough.
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.580]   This is tough.
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:16.900]   If I meet a secret or a private group on Facebook, I would assume --
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.900]   That it's private.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.900]   That it's private.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:19.900]   That it's private.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.900]   And that you're not trying to show it to the world.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.900]   I'm not trying to show it to the world and unless somebody in the group --
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   That should be allowed.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.900]   That should be.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.900]   Right.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.380]   And if somebody complains, then what you want to expect is the group to govern itself.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.380]   Right.
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.180]   But I guess Facebook doesn't want to get in the middle of all that.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.460]   One of one members says, "You shouldn't do this in this group," and the rest of the group
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.860]   says, "Leave the group," and then once Facebook do, "You kill that person's account."
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:39.860]   Right.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:40.860]   That seems --
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.860]   It's not going to be a mask parade yet.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:42.860]   No.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.860]   No.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860]   This is the --
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860]   It's better on iPhone.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.860]   I'm not --
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:48.860]   For just having done this.
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.860]   I was going to just --
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:50.860]   Well, it's not --
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:51.860]   You get back to --
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.860]   My fault.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.860]   It's better on iPhone.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.860]   Okay.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:57.860]   So this is -- this is called "mask parade MSQ."
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:58.860]   Let's do it with you.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.860]   That's what you're facing there.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.860]   Now I --
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.860]   Oh.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   I have -- so your face is on my head.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.860]   Okay.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.860]   I'll take a picture of it so I can --
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.860]   Speaking of trends.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.860]   Seriously.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.860]   It's not working fully in India.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:14.860]   Transitioning.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:16.860]   Right.
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.860]   Oh.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.860]   Wow.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:19.860]   Now we can move to another -- I see I broke it.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:20.860]   It's permanently --
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.860]   It's --
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:22.860]   It's permanently --
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:23.860]   It's permanently -- I don't know if you can see that.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.860]   We do have camera operators.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.860]   They probably consume -- oh, it's all messed up now.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.860]   It's really -- it's really confused.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   Jason Hell and I did a face mask, I think was the name of the app.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.860]   Yeah, face mask.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:35.860]   On all of it, Android, it was equally as horrified.
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860]   No offense, Jason.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.380]   It crashes Android, so it sends some sort of weird crash mode right now.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.860]   But I think it's sufficiently horrific that you can see.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.060]   Anyway, Facebook bought this company.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.460]   And it's kind of a similar effect.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.860]   You've probably seen this in Snapchat, right?
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:56.860]   Where you can overlay stuff on your -- So you can also just put -- I'll show you.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.860]   What I have to do is force quit it and then go back into it.
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.860]   It's got -- there's a bug.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.860]   You know, I bought an iPod Touch so I could try apps out on my house.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.860]   This is perfect, right, but -- I did too.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.860]   I'm in.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   So here, Jeff.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.860]   Now Jeff is a little furry dog.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.860]   He's a gorilla.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:17.860]   He's got a mustache.
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:18.860]   There you can see it.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:20.860]   And I think you look good in that.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.860]   That's a good look for you, huh?
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.860]   So you could see what you would look like with a mustache.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.860]   So it's -- you take the picture of the video.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   Do you send it?
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   Is it a mustache?
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:31.860]   You can share it.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860]   In fact, if you guess where you could share it, Instagram.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.860]   Or Facebook.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.860]   And I think that was before.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.860]   The point is, I think that this is -- they couldn't get Snapchat.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:43.860]   So what you're going to see is Facebook starting to build out their message and platform to be as Snapchat as possible.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.860]   Right, right.
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.860]   It's fun.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860]   It's fun.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.860]   Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of himself as Iron Man.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.860]   That is kind of a weird choice.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:53.860]   Well, no, because he's -- he wants to --
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:54.860]   He wants to draw Tony Stark.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:55.860]   But he's not.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:56.860]   As I say, he is a billionaire.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.860]   It's true.
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.860]   Elon Musk is Tony Stark.
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.860]   You can't be Tony Stark.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:02.860]   I think that's fair.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.860]   I don't know what the price was.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   It's a Russian company.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   But what's interesting is that this technology is so widespread now.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.860]   I don't think it's so hard to do because I see it everywhere.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:12.860]   It's not everywhere.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:13.860]   It's true.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.860]   It's true.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.860]   So I hope they got a billion dollars.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:16.860]   Did you Snapchat?
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:17.860]   Leo, on a regular?
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:23.860]   You know, I -- yeah, I know, and I have it, and I know how to use it, and I have a cake on a cake.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.860]   You were your father the night, I had a cake.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:26.860]   But you might be proud of Snapchat.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:27.860]   You still --
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.860]   You might be proud of Snapchat.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.860]   I'm not even going to figure out how to use it.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.860]   No, I haven't even thought about that.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.860]   And he said, "Well, everybody knows how to use it.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.860]   Why don't we?"
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.860]   There's no rules.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.860]   It doesn't explain.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:37.860]   It doesn't.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.860]   But I think that generation -- it's the same thing with Minecraft.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.860]   Part of -- for an app to succeed with a young generation, Jake, you can further deny this.
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:49.860]   I think it has to have a component of peer learning.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:56.860]   So that you learn -- there's value for Snapchat of having your buddy say, "Oh, no.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.860]   Let me show you how to do that."
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   Oh, I'm going to show you how to do this thing.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.860]   And then you have this bond.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.860]   And then -- And you're not going to tell everybody that you just didn't know that.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:03.860]   There's an investment.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.860]   Right.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.860]   Right.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:06.860]   Jake, do you use Snapchat?
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:07.860]   He's too old.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.860]   He's tough.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   Snapchatting.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.860]   Well, I read that BuzzFeed piece about how, you know, teens really use -- which I'm always
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860]   a little bit skeptical.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.860]   This was several -- a couple months ago.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:18.860]   But I still was like, "Oh, I don't.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860]   This is beyond my ability."
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:20.860]   That's fun.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:21.860]   The problem I have with it --
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.860]   You just don't have to do direct stories.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:23.860]   I do stories.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:24.860]   Because I'm -- that's my problem.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   Because you're a broadcaster.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.860]   And the real reason I don't use it is because after 24 hours it goes away.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:34.860]   And my whole life is built around making stuff that you keep.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:35.860]   Permanent.
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.860]   I mean, admittedly, there's a certain amount of fish wrapped.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.860]   The stuff we do.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.860]   Because Twitter -- Twitter is there.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:43.860]   But when you ever go back -- It's gone.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.860]   It goes gone.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.860]   It's true.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   It's true.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   It's true.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.860]   The MSQRD team is young.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.860]   Really?
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.860]   Eugene Nev-Jinn, Sergey Gonsha, are 23.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.860]   The CEO is Eugene Zetapayakin, and he's 30.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.860]   And they have other companies as well.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.860]   And it was just one of those things that often happens.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.860]   They launched before Christmas.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.860]   They took off in Eastern Europe.
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.860]   You know how that is.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:11.860]   Yep.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.860]   And they were purchased by Facebook in March.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:15.860]   Good for them.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.860]   They had 16 million users when they were acquired.
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.860]   Not acquired.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.860]   But their servers are ready.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:24.860]   Well, I'm sure they'll move immediately to a Facebook network.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.860]   That's a nice one.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.860]   I'd like that to announce the deal until you've done that.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.860]   Yes.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.860]   Yes.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.860]   They were two other companies bidding against them.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   So that's why I think the -- Well, we don't know the number.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   I'm sure it was good.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.860]   Twitter is shutting down a Moji tracker.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:39.860]   That's annoying.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.860]   Moji tracker.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   You're just going to know it anytime.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.860]   That may be just annoying.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.860]   I'm just peeved.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.860]   I'm taking over from you.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.860]   Two is going to have a bad tracker.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.860]   I'm here.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.860]   I decided maybe you're going to do your best for your New York
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860]   lawyer.
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.860]   Crank.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   You're watching.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.860]   The Moji tracker we used was the one that said that would rank
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.860]   emoji use on Twitter.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:27:59.860]   It was really cool.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.860]   Remember we showed all that.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:03.860]   But the most in real time was really cool.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.860]   But Twitter platform operations sent them an email saying hello
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:09.860]   from Twitter during our recent audit of our developer platform.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.860]   A record show.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:13.860]   The account associated with this email address currently has
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.860]   elevated access to the streaming API.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:16.860]   No.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.860]   You can't do it.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   That no longer exists.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:21.860]   Well, you can pay.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.860]   You can't, probably it's expensive.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:24.860]   Oh, can it?
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.860]   Right.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.860]   Because they have the fire hose.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:29.860]   So is that what it essentially was that they said you want to use
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:30.860]   the fire hose, you go to Gannip?
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.860]   And I don't think that Gannip offered the elevated streaming,
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.860]   offered everything elevated streaming did.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.860]   But this is like an indie developer who like open source thought
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.860]   this whole thing.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.860]   And it was just a fun project.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:46.860]   Well, but it was more than that because the emoji committee on
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:50.860]   the unicorn consortium, there is an emoji committee.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:51.860]   Yep.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.860]   Well, they brought us dumplings.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.860]   Yes.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.860]   We didn't have dumplings.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   Right.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.860]   Thanks to Jenny Eighley.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:58.860]   Jenny Eighley says we used emoji tracker.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.860]   We wouldn't even consider.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.860]   We wouldn't.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   A big factor in the new emoji criteria is whether we'd expect to
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.860]   find it above the median in emoji tracker.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.860]   So.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860]   Wow.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.860]   That's too bad.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:16.860]   There's kind of a, there is at some level, I think, see what you
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   think about this, Gina.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.860]   I would even argue an ethical responsibility that if you have the
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.860]   data, that's the voice of the people.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   I don't mean at an individual level, but I mean at an area level.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:31.860]   And an age when AI can analyze all this and you can use sensors
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   and do all this thing, shouldn't that data be open to us,
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.860]   the people who made it?
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   Yes.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.860]   We've been saying that all.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.860]   It's an old fashioned way of thinking about it.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:41.860]   Yes.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.860]   That's why it's right.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:43.860]   I agree.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.860]   But no, me too.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:45.860]   Me too.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   I absolutely believe that's it.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.860]   If I were Ugo Chavez, I'd nationalize it.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.860]   That's what I do.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.860]   I'm saying, I'm telling you, when Bernie gets in, we're going to
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860]   nationalize Twitter.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:57.860]   We're going to nationalize Twitter, which is taking it over.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   But that would be a good thing to nationalize, right?
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   That's true.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:02.860]   It's true.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.860]   Sorry, Jack.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:04.860]   We want it.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:06.860]   Well, I'm an eminent domain.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.860]   Yeah, you're all the people.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.860]   I mean, part of the reason why I started to think of it was I
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:13.860]   was just so annoyed that I couldn't get past more than 3,200 of my
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.860]   own tweet.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.860]   My own tweet.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.860]   Somebody even talking about like the tweets of the world.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   How do you use the API?
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.860]   Yeah, I'm using just the straight basic refs API, which pages back
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.860]   3,200 tweets.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:25.860]   Okay.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.860]   And you get all the tweets.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:28.860]   You don't get a sample of tweets.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.860]   You get just 3,200.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:32.860]   So if you have posted more than 3,200 tweets, then that's, I'm
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.860]   only getting that many, right?
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.860]   And most people at this point, the company's been around for 10
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.860]   years, who are any sort of user have more than 3,200 tweets.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.860]   In fact, Twitter just had its tent in a period.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.860]   That's right.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.860]   They did.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.860]   And I was just in their first tweet.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   My first tweet was actually totally appropriate.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.860]   I surrender Twitter.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:54.860]   You win with my first tweet.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.860]   My first tweet.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:59.860]   10 years ago, my first tweet was okay.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.860]   I'll try Twitter again.
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.860]   There you go.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.860]   You and I, I'm telling you, great minds.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:06.860]   Mine was home time for a nap.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   I had just got home from South by Southwest and I said, oh, fine.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:11.860]   That's what everyone's using.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:13.860]   I will just sign up.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.860]   I'm not going to get it.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:17.860]   Okay.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.860]   No, gave mine.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.860]   Did you read Jack's interview at the Bloomberg Business, the future
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:24.860]   of Twitter and that conversation?
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.860]   I've read how many stories about the future of Twitter that
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:27.860]   made.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.860]   And I don't know if Jack really knows what the future of Twitter
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:31.860]   is.
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:32.860]   It's a puddle.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.860]   It's a future of Twitter.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:34.860]   Is that what he said?
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:35.860]   It's a puddle?
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.860]   Yeah, I guess there is, I had missed this.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:40.860]   There was a periscope video of a puddle on the street in England
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.860]   that went viral where everybody was watching the puddle.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.860]   You're watching people what they're doing with the puddle and
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   walking around the puddle.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.860]   I, so that was interesting that he.
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:55.860]   That was getting 20,000 simultaneous pubers.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.860]   Total of 650,000 live views of a puddle.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:04.860]   And apparently Twitter was like really in on this.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.860]   Jack says I was watching the puddle.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.860]   It wasn't even the people in the puddle or what they were doing.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.860]   It was the fact that I was watching with other people.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.860]   And I was connected to the audience.
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:18.860]   And I could actually talk with them.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:19.860]   Is that the puddle?
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:20.860]   No, that's just my fault.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:21.860]   I'm sure it's not important.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.860]   Yeah, he really focused on the fact that Twitter is this real
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.860]   time togetherness.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.860]   You're the puddle.
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:31.860]   What a weird thing for everybody to look at.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.860]   Well, I think the point he was trying to make is that even the
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.860]   most mundane, you know, even if there isn't a big news event,
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.860]   like somebody important dying art, whatever, an attack or whatever,
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.860]   that even the most mundane thing, like a puddle can be common news
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:42.860]   event.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.860]   And that's what people do on the internet when there isn't news
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.860]   they make news, you know, the dress or whatever.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.860]   And I sort of get that.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.860]   It was just a little bit of a...
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:54.860]   The puddle was a weird analogy, but what he ends up saying, I think
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:58.860]   is accurate, Twitter can be distilled down to the simplicity of
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.860]   here's what's going to happen in the world.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.860]   Here's what's happening right now.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.860]   And I agree.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860]   That's what Twitter is.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:06.860]   And here's the funny thing about Twitter is Twitter is Twitter
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.860]   thought it was going to be here's what's happening with you.
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.860]   Instead of Twitter, here's what's happening in the world.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860]   Which is amazing.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   And that's amazing.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.860]   Which is different than Facebook.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.860]   We didn't know it was going to be a news service.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860]   It's a news service.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.860]   Well, you couldn't even imagine that unless you got critical
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.860]   mass and you wouldn't as a startup just say, well, of course
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.860]   we're going to have, you know, 800 million, actually they only
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.860]   have 300 million users, but we're going to have the right 300
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.860]   million, I guess.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.860]   Right.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.860]   Let's see.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.860]   Jeff, I'm interested to know what you think about matter because
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.860]   the matter becoming its own company.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.860]   Because you're the media.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860]   You're my medium person.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   Speaking of changing is mind.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.860]   Yes.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:45.860]   You know, I have the greatest respect for out of, but I
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.860]   imagine working for out of this, you know, what's
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.860]   happening today.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.860]   Right.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:50.860]   Well, how do you wake up?
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.860]   Right.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:52.860]   That's the best product people in the world.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:54.860]   The white hat, if he's happy in the red hat, if he's not.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:57.860]   Obviously, he's the only in the red hat these days.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.860]   So I think that there was a time when medium wanted to be a
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:03.860]   content company publisher itself, a platter shirt God help us.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   And I think that they're not in that as much anymore.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:12.860]   They're getting prominent people to write on and use medium.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.860]   Very successfully.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.860]   Very successfully.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.860]   And that's working.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.860]   My old agent, Kate Lee, is doing a great job of that and others.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:22.860]   But I think the idea that they had to own content and they had to
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.860]   prime the pump, I think they're less into.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.860]   So he didn't kill it.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.860]   He didn't jettison it.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:28.860]   It's only 100% by evilliums.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.860]   It's now a content laboratory.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:32.860]   So I don't know what the hell that means, but I didn't know what
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:33.860]   the hell Twitter meant.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.860]   I didn't know what the hell mattered.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:35.860]   Me neither.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.860]   So it could be just a way that you kind of save face to keep it
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.860]   alive or could be that they mean it and they're going to try new
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860]   things.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:42.860]   I don't know.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:44.860]   What is matter, the parent company of medium?
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   No, no.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:51.860]   Matter was a Kickstarter backed journalistic magaziney thing that
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]   I didn't even know.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860]   Million bought.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.860]   Oh, I thought it was just a publication on media.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:57.860]   I didn't realize it had been a Kickstarter.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:01.860]   Bobby Johnson was one of the founders of the Guardian and they
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:04.860]   started it separately and they did a whole big Kickstarter
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.860]   raise.
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.860]   So it was controversial and they got bought like, "Hello, I gave
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.860]   you money.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:09.860]   Where's mine?"
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:11.860]   But that's not been one of those.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.860]   Yeah, that was a little bit rough.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   And so they've done some neat things.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.860]   But I take it back in the sense that of course, medium does
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:23.860]   have its own content products insofar as our good friend age.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.860]   This is simply age talking.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:26.860]   Yes.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.860]   Former Wired, former Newsweek, right Spont technology.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:29.860]   Stephen Levy.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.860]   Stephen Levy's back channel.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:32.860]   So we just back channeled.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.860]   Oh, we've never had a writer.
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:34.860]   That's not it.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.860]   He is on staff.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:37.860]   That is an owned and operated channel.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:38.860]   Like matter.
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:39.860]   But not matter.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:40.860]   But not matter.
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   Right.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:42.860]   So they still don't have time.
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:43.860]   It's like it's confusing mess.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.860]   They still do have content and they're moving this off to be
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.860]   a laboratory.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.860]   So I don't mind.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:48.860]   Who knows?
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:49.860]   Evan doesn't know.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.860]   That's the joy of it.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.860]   They have said that we might start doing advertising on this.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.860]   Yes.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.860]   So there is a plan perhaps to monetize it.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.860]   Well, I'm just betting my guess is Gina that they're saying,
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:02.860]   okay, this was fun.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.860]   We're not going to kill you.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:05.860]   Let's see if you can make it go over.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.860]   Did F spin matter out or did they spin themselves out of me?
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:11.860]   Who has spun that around still owned by F?
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   But it's operating separately from media.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   But it's on media.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.860]   It's using media in the platform still.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:18.860]   It's on.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.860]   That's very confusing.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860]   It's very confusing.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.860]   And it's not a website, they say.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860]   It's not a website.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:24.860]   Right.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.860]   Because nobody wants to be a website anymore.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:27.860]   It's on the web.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:28.860]   Oh, but he won't be a website.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.860]   You look at it on the browser, but it's not a website.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:31.860]   You don't want to be an app.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:32.860]   You don't want to be a website.
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.860]   You want to complain to convince about being on the platforms.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.860]   And you just want to be unhappy.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:41.860]   Don't let the internet name your boat.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:43.860]   I'm just saying.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.860]   This is never a good idea.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.860]   The British, you know what?
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:48.860]   We're starting the new show in New York.
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.860]   Why don't we let the internet name the show?
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   Oh, we should.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   And what do they will get?
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:59.860]   So the British government decided to let the internet suggest a name for a $287 million
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.860]   polar research ship.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:08.860]   And the name, ladies and gentlemen, RRS Bodie McBoatface.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:11.860]   The wisdom of the crowd.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:18.860]   The government suggested the names like the Shackleton, the RSS Endeavor, Falcon.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.860]   No, no.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.860]   Bodie McBoatface.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:30.860]   This is, as you might remember, very much in the same vein as the Slovak bridge naming
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.860]   in 2012.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:35.860]   They actually, lawmakers had to override the public's vote.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   They wanted the public to say to name it after Chuck Norris.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:46.860]   A year earlier in Austin, Texas, people tried to name the city's waste management service Fred Durst.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.860]   Although Limp Biscuit would have been better for a waste management service.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.860]   So it's 4chan is the problem, I think.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.860]   So we are to be Twiggy McTwigface.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:58.860]   Twiggy McTwigface?
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.860]   Not a bad name.
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:08.860]   Incidentally, the guy who proposed the name Bodie McBoatface is a public relations guy and former BBC employee.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:13.860]   He tweeted it and now his latest tweet is "I'm terribly sorry about all of this."
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.860]   My apology.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:20.860]   So I hope they name it Bodie McBoatface.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:21.860]   It's not over yet.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.860]   The polls close April 16th.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:26.860]   So you have time to change it to Shackleton or Endeavor.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:29.860]   It's still the most loved all time, the most loved today.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:31.860]   Like, people are still voting.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.860]   The problem is that somebody people are voting.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.860]   The website keeps crashing.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860]   Here's one.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.860]   Eufasia Supurba.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.860]   Vivian Fuchs.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.860]   Deep Blue Explorer.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.860]   There's quite a few of these.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:48.860]   But look at the most loved.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.860]   Most loved overall.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.860]   Let's see.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:54.860]   Number one, RSS, RRS, Bodie McBoatface.
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.860]   And I presume Henry Worsley is another joke.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.860]   Probably a British joke.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:00.860]   David Attenborough.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:01.860]   That'd be a good name.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.860]   Or the RRS is bloody cold here.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:08.860]   It's bloody cold out here.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.860]   You saying boat?
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:10.860]   Good name.
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.860]   I like that.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:12.860]   I like that one.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.860]   The same boat is pretty great.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.860]   Bodie McBoatface the return of Bodie McBoatface.
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:18.860]   Well, Bodie McBoatface.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:19.860]   That's good.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.860]   Internet joke stories.
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:22.860]   You're our boat.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.860]   Thanks for all the fish.
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.860]   I like big boats and I cannot lie.
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.860]   RRS, what iceberg?
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.860]   Remember, it is going to be in the Antarctic.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.860]   Wow.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:35.860]   Most loved today.
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.860]   This is actually, you know what, they're getting a lot of attention.
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:40.860]   They are.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.860]   You know what, go ahead and go with the name at that time.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.860]   Can I vote?
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.860]   Can I heart Bodie McBoatface?
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:46.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.860]   I voted.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860]   Thank you for voting.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.860]   Okay, another problem.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   There was no sign up.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860]   There was no registration.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860]   Right.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   Right.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.860]   How many scripts are just getting that URL?
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:56.860]   Just voted.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:03.860]   The website is nameirship.nerc.ac.uk.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:05.860]   Okay, if you'd like to cast your vote, NERC.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:06.860]   Go to NERC.
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.860]   Mmm, let's see.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:09.860]   Anything else?
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.860]   This is fun.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.860]   I don't know what time it is because I can't understand this.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   It is now 630.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:16.860]   So that would be 3.30 hour time.
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.860]   So this is a good time to start wrapping up here.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:22.860]   Last minute stories in the year.
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:26.860]   Well, I think we do have to talk about.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.860]   The Happy Meal from the CUNY.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.860]   By the way, I am also wearing CUNY Swag.
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.860]   I'm going to smirk the brand.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.860]   This is a nice hoodie.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.860]   Thanks.
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:37.860]   Was it Simon who gave me?
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:38.860]   Simon, thank you Simon.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.860]   You are now a capital day journalist.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:46.860]   This is in honor of the CUNY school journalism team that's playing in the March Madness NCWA finals
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:47.860]   I hear.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.860]   That's what they told me.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.860]   So I find it.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:52.860]   All right, Leo.
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:53.860]   Yes.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.860]   Oh, you want to talk about porn?
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.860]   I've never seen.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:57.860]   I've never seen.
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:58.860]   He's giving me the look.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.860]   I've never seen him.
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.860]   Why am I the next person?
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:01.860]   Yes.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.860]   So I'm saying I have a thing.
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.860]   What do you think of VR porn, Gina?
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.860]   Welcome back, Gina.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.860]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:16.860]   So Pornhub, which is a very well-known, I hear, very well-known popular.
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:19.860]   It's kind of a YouTube of porn, I think.
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:24.860]   They have added a virtual reality section for both Oculus and Google.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:25.860]   But here's the thing.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:26.860]   Here's the thing.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:27.860]   Justin Theory.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:28.860]   It's like the problem I have with interviews.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:31.860]   Pornhub is the 65th most visited site on the internet.
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:32.860]   That is, wow.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.860]   Before we created, I don't get it.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:36.860]   I don't either.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.860]   You aren't going to look.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:42.860]   You're not in a space again, unless you're in an orgy maybe, but then I don't get it.
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:51.860]   Is it just because it's new?
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.860]   Enthusiast will try it because it's new.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.860]   Yeah, it's not good.
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:55.860]   I was trying to bait him.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:56.860]   It's just not working.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.860]   I'm trying my best.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.860]   I'm probably restrained.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.860]   I'm not really impressed.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.860]   All right.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:04.860]   Just research.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.860]   I have a VR.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:07.860]   Okay.
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:13.860]   And Samsung Galaxy S6, and it turns out there are a number of providers of adult content
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.860]   who actually make VR video.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:20.860]   It's scarily realistic, actually.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:21.860]   Really?
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:23.860]   It's like good or bad.
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:24.860]   But is it fun?
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:25.860]   I mean, is it good?
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:26.860]   Well, do you think porn is fun?
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:27.860]   Sure.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:28.860]   It looks as if you think porn is fun.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:29.860]   It's fun.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:30.860]   We can speak like adults.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:31.860]   I mean, you know, whatever.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.860]   If you think porn is fun, you will quite enjoy this.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:34.860]   Really?
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.860]   Because it's not immersive.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.860]   The whole idea, this is what VR is all about, right?
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.860]   It's putting you in the middle of the action.
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:43.860]   But it's not right.
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:44.860]   Is it a secret?
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:45.860]   Is it a secret?
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.260]   Well, usually, so the ones I've seen the way they shoot it is they, they, and actually,
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.860]   on my mind, I always am thinking about the performer who's got something strapped on their
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:55.860]   head.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:01.860]   Because what they do is, yes, it's your performer in it.
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:04.860]   And it's on your face, apparently, because you...
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.860]   Of what you're seeing.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.860]   And so what you're seeing is, because you can see your own body.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.860]   You can look down and go, "Whoa!"
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.860]   But what happens when things go off the rails?
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.860]   Like, when the thing that you wouldn't have done happens.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:18.860]   It's like, that's the point I've been going to.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:24.460]   No, well, he or she, by the way, that's what's really interesting, is to put yourself in
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.740]   the female perspective for a man.
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:30.460]   And I have a new appreciation for...
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.460]   You think.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.460]   For...
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.260]   I don't know.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:37.460]   How do you talk about this in a way that's not weird?
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:38.460]   No, I think it's okay.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   So I'm enjoying this.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.460]   I know.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:41.460]   It is.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.460]   So you've all come on in.
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.460]   You're all the money.
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:48.740]   Here's what it is, is normally when you're watching a movie, or...
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.220]   We're used to it now with video games, but when you're watching a movie or television
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:55.220]   show, or adult content, the director is choosing what you see.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.220]   Right.
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:57.220]   In a video game.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:01.220]   You know, because you've played video games, you look around.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.780]   You look up, you look down.
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:04.780]   So in an adult...
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:06.180]   Now, Jason, don't...
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:07.860]   I think you probably shouldn't.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:10.820]   But in an adult environment, you look around.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.460]   You see, you can see where you are.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.420]   You can see the space.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:16.580]   Very much like the video that Jason's showing on the screen.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:17.580]   Don't look into the right...
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.580]   And you're very nervous right now.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.220]   Don't look to the right, whatever you do.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.060]   So you can actually look and you can see the set, and you can see...
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:26.780]   You can't see the camera because you are the camera.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.700]   So it's like a first person shooter?
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.700]   Yeah!
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.700]   Literally.
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:31.700]   Sometimes.
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.700]   Showed title.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.700]   And you get to choose...
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:36.700]   I'm sorry, I haven't tried this.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.100]   Do you get to choose which player you want to be?
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:40.100]   It depends.
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:41.100]   No, not the player.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.100]   This works.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   You watch it.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.100]   You choose a movie.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.100]   Right.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.340]   So you will be like watching a porn video, except that the difference is that you're the
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:52.740]   camera, your head is the camera and you're looking around.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:53.740]   The only thing you really...
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.180]   The only thing you really can't see is your own face.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:58.180]   Right.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.580]   But you can look down and see your shoulder and...
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:02.740]   You get to be one player.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:03.740]   There's one choice.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.740]   You are one person in this interaction.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.740]   Well, how would you be more than one person?
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.740]   Well, I mean, could you be...
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:10.180]   Because you were saying you could be a man or one man or one.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.380]   Oh yeah, but you have to pick the video you're watching.
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.380]   You have to pick the video you want.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.380]   And it's so...
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:16.380]   Well, Gina just wrote a new application.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.220]   I'm just curious, how does that work?
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.540]   Because you know, there's various flavors.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:23.020]   I mean, is it like, oh, be this person in this scenario?
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.300]   Well, yeah, you could take any content.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.300]   You could take any content.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.300]   That's not even an adult content.
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.300]   It's really hard to discuss without...
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.940]   No, you take any content.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:31.580]   Without saying it's adult content.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.660]   Let's say we're taking a walk in the park.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.460]   You pick that walk in the park.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.460]   Right.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.460]   Because it's not live.
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:40.660]   You're picking a prerecorded walk in the park, but they're recording it, like with a Theta.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:41.660]   Right.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:44.700]   360, they're recording it in such a way that you can...
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:45.700]   You can't not walk.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700]   Right, that's what it is.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.940]   You can look around as you're walking, right?
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.860]   You can see what's behind you, what's in front of you, up and down.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:56.620]   But if you were walking a dog in the park, would you get the choice to be the dog or the human?
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:57.620]   No!
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:58.620]   No!
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:45:59.620]   You get to be human.
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.620]   That's the end of the day.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.060]   Yeah, unless somebody makes a video of you as a dog, and then you're experiencing it as a dog.
[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:04.060]   Right, so this is exactly...
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:05.060]   This guy's holding up his ring.
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.060]   This guy's kind of an interesting thing, yeah.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:12.060]   So, there is, I mean, beyond the salacious part of this, there is an interesting experience
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:15.820]   not to be mad, because you are, in effect, putting yourself in somebody else's shoes.
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.820]   One does lead in ways.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.820]   Okay, you're safe now.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:22.820]   Sorry about that.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.820]   You hit a button.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.820]   That was very good.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   It was wonderful.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:33.100]   Well, it actually is a larger discussion, and sometimes really big, about what the experience
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:37.820]   of immersive video is versus the experience of a passive viewer.
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.820]   Right.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:41.180]   And really that's it, is that you're looking around now.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:46.820]   Some of these VR tools, like the Vive, which will give you hand controls, may even give
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.820]   you...
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:51.660]   One of the reasons I think you get sick in VR is you don't control your motion very
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:52.660]   well.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:53.660]   Right.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:58.020]   So, you're being moved around in ways that you don't fully control.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:02.540]   And augmented reality doesn't have that problem, because you are walking and moving.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.540]   Right.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.420]   And so, your movement is controls what you see.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:09.540]   With VR helmets, it's really your head movement only that's controlling what you see.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.540]   Right.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.540]   And you live at this time.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.540]   I have to talk about the narrative.
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:16.500]   I mean, like, there's a sequence of events that happens, right?
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.500]   You're in a movie.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.500]   You're in a movie.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   Right.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500]   You're in a movie, right?
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.500]   But you're choosing the point of view in the movie.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.500]   You're choosing the point of view, but you're not choosing what's happening.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.500]   Right.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.620]   And things are happening whether you're looking at them or not.
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:28.460]   It's a little bit disconcerting, I'd imagine.
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.460]   It can be.
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:30.460]   It's also very interesting.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:34.300]   And I think that's why it's interesting for news, because...
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.300]   Which is seriously why I ask.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:37.900]   Because it is saying the ideas here.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:42.780]   So, I watched the time stuff.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:45.180]   The first thing the times did, they did other stuff.
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.620]   But the first thing the times did was about children displaced by war.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:55.060]   And again, and this is probably because of my training, I always, I don't think so much
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.060]   about what I'm seeing as the mechanics of producing it.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:01.420]   And so, the first thing I do is I look around and say, "What was the reporter?"
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.260]   So this child is going through her day in a bombed out house and she's making breakfast
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:06.260]   and stuff.
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.420]   And I'm thinking, "What did they do?
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:08.420]   Did they set up a camera?"
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:14.300]   And they said, "Okay, I'm going to leave the room, just lead your normal life."
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.300]   And that's a little strange in terms of new character.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.580]   There's pictures of them kind of working over the edge.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:23.660]   They can see what was going on, but they weren't in the image, because the image is there.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:24.940]   Yeah, I think that's wrong.
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:25.940]   I see that all the time.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:30.300]   I see a movie, like I'm watching Les Misérables, a movie, and I'm thinking about the playback
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.260]   and the crew and like, "Well, is she singing that now?
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.660]   Or is she listening to sound?"
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.860]   So that's just me.
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:39.460]   And so when I see these news stories, I always think, "That's bad.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.460]   That's wrong.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.460]   That's staged."
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:42.460]   Yes, I agree with you.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:45.500]   And so I think it'd be much smarter as a reporter to be in the...
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:49.020]   But then you have another problem, which you're always supposed to talk not to do, which is
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.460]   you're in the story.
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.460]   But maybe that's...
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.460]   But that's what this means.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.740]   That's what immersive means is you're in the story.
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:58.620]   So it opens up a whole bunch of interesting things.
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:01.260]   And in the adult context, I think it is...
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.380]   I think it is very interesting.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:06.620]   It's not something I would do regularly, but...
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:10.980]   Doesn't it look like it's going to take over just regular watching a movie?
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:14.420]   But the question is, does it potentially increase empathy?
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:16.500]   I mean, you have said...
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.500]   Yes.
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.500]   Yes.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:19.500]   Yes.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.700]   That I would agree with.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:25.260]   And just as maybe if you're watching children of war...
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:29.500]   No, well, I have empathy for women in porn.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:30.500]   Seriously.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:31.500]   I appreciate that.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.500]   I mean, I don't do porn.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.500]   No, I know.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.260]   But I mean, no, that was actually a very interesting experience because it was like...
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.380]   I'm kind of being abused here.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:42.140]   To be frank.
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:44.900]   That's why we love you, Liam.
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.540]   I mean, it was like, no, stop that!
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.380]   No, no!
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:50.380]   Anyway.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.380]   It's so fascinating.
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:55.980]   This is the conversation I always wanted to avoid.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:56.980]   I managed to.
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.980]   Your right school is very proud of you right now for a long time.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:00.820]   We're all a right road, I think so.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:03.700]   It is germane to what your school is up to.
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.700]   It is.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:08.500]   And it's very much part of what I think o-turs of virtual reality are going to have to really
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.980]   think about is what does immersive video mean, what is the role of the o-tur, whether it's
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.900]   journalist or just a photographer, what is the role?
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:19.100]   And in the case of adult entertainment, you're the performer.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.020]   Which is a really weird situation.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.340]   I guess it would be as if you're in a play, let's say you're doing a VR of a play, and
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:26.660]   you're the actor, you're one of the actors in the play.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:31.660]   You would have the experience of the play as a performer and not as an audience member.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:32.660]   That's what happens in adult.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.780]   And that is a huge opportunity to change things, but it's fundamentally changing the idea of
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.420]   storytelling, the idea of presence, the idea of photography.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.420]   Point of view, everything.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.420]   And view all that.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:43.700]   So is it going to be huge?
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.700]   I don't know.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.700]   No, I think it is.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:46.700]   You think it is.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:47.700]   I don't mean just porn.
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:48.700]   I mean, 360.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:52.980]   No, actually I don't know what the future of adult content is, but I think in general,
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:54.900]   immersive video is huge.
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:59.380]   But it's such a new medium we don't, we're just in the infancy of what do you do and
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:00.500]   how does it work.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:03.060]   But I think you were saying empathy is very interesting.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.820]   I hadn't really thought about that, but absolutely.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.220]   It's one thing you would say.
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:09.620]   Yeah, there's one thing you would absolutely get out of that is this sense of empathy.
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:16.540]   You also, there's a, I mean, the way that Samsung was selling its 360 camera is as a
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:23.460]   way to go with, yeah, this is the child children of war, which I mean, it's just such a horrific
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.460]   story.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.020]   I think that you would gain some empathy from this.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:28.540]   I'm sure that's what the New York Times is thinking.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:29.900]   The Samsung was selling it as well.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:35.580]   You can't be in Paris with your friends, but they can walk around with their gear camera
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:39.580]   and you can wear your gear VR at home and have the experience of walking down the shops
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:40.580]   at least.
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:45.100]   There was that one on Google+ I think her name was Emma Monica, who was not very mobile.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:46.660]   She had some health conditions.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.660]   Perfect example.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:51.860]   So she would, there were cases where you could take a photographer in a canoe and say,
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.220]   "Oh, can you go to the left there?"
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.220]   Very embellish on this.
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.380]   I think it's phenomenal.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:00.100]   And even if you don't direct the action, you're with your friends and if it's in real time
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:05.860]   and you're talking to them, I mean, imagine if you were here sitting here in VR, you'd
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:07.300]   be part of the action.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:08.300]   I think it's great.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.300]   I'm all in.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.780]   Should we do a VR episode?
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:14.260]   Well, I've actually really intrigued and once the cameras get better, we will do that.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.260]   That's cool.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:16.260]   Yeah, we will do that.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.380]   I almost kind of want to just be the silent observer, like have the reporter in it and
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:23.300]   have it going on, but have just someone else, you know, if someone wanted to be a twig,
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.300]   you know, they could sit right here and you can look at us.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.300]   This is so much one way.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.300]   I'll give you a sample.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.300]   I mean, a true round table.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.300]   Right.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.300]   Charlie Rose is a table.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:32.300]   He'd be very different.
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.220]   You'd be in the middle of the table maybe.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:39.980]   One of the first VR things that it was one of the first presidential debates, the Republican
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:43.180]   debates, and I was amazed.
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:48.980]   So it started before the debate, you're in the back of the room and I'm looking at
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:51.940]   Raditz as if you're in the audience, but it's weird because I think the people who
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:54.940]   were in the audience didn't realize that they were on camera because it's just a little
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.940]   ball.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.940]   Right.
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.940]   And I'm looking down.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.620]   I'm actually looking over somebody's shoulder.
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.380]   I can see him looking at his phone.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:06.660]   There's a television camera guy next to me who's waiting because he's going to tell
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:07.660]   my face.
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:09.500]   He's chewing gum and he's going, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:10.500]   And you're looking around.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.380]   It's like you're an invisible character sitting there.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.140]   Then they turned out they had many cameras.
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:17.820]   So I first, I thought this is going to be terrible because they're, I'm in the back
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:19.660]   of the auditorium and they're way down there.
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:24.260]   But then they switched to really interestingly a backstage camera.
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.700]   And they've done this a couple of times with the debates.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:30.860]   It's very interesting to be backstage watching the candidates as they're introduced.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:34.220]   That was an amazing experience.
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:38.020]   And you really felt like you see, you know, Carly Fiorina kind of adjust yourself and
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.980]   gear, bring gear up to go on stage.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.900]   I actually really enjoyed that.
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:47.140]   So I think there's a huge opportunity to be part there.
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:48.140]   Is this the video from the debate?
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.140]   I guess it is.
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:55.180]   Huge opportunity to be part of it in an event in a way that we don't normally get to be.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.180]   And I think that's exciting.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.940]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.540]   Do you want to do?
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:03.660]   We don't have a, you know, you know, what was that change log thing?
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:05.500]   I don't have a change log.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.500]   You have a tip.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:07.500]   Sure.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:08.500]   And you have a number.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.740]   All right, I'll come up with a tool.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.900]   But before we do that, this is a great time.
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:17.260]   If you're in the market for a new phone to go to gazelle.com, Apple's announced a new
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.260]   phone.
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:21.500]   There's really great new Android phones.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.500]   Maybe you want a Galaxy S7?
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.460]   Hey, that's an $800 phone.
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:25.460]   Here's how you can help pay for it.
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:28.300]   And I know a lot of people who do this, they like to have the latest thing.
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:32.860]   They go to gazelle to sell the old one, generate some cash to pay for the new one.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.420]   You could trade in your old device.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:36.100]   You don't even have to commit at this point.
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.820]   You can commit gazelle, but you don't have to commit.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:43.620]   When you go there and get a quote for your device, gazelle's locked in for 30 days.
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:47.300]   That means you have 30 days to decide whether you're going to get the new phone, wait for
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:52.820]   you the phone to arrive, transfer your data over, and then click the checkout button.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.100]   And gazelle will send you a box.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.460]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a book.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.220]   In fact, while you're at it, pile in a bunch of stuff.
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:03.420]   You can get cash, PayPal credit, or an Amazon gift card.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.820]   They bump that up 5%.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:10.860]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E is easily the best way to sell your used gadgets.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:12.620]   They buy a whole bunch of different stuff.
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.540]   They'll even buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.740]   They can resell those for parts.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.300]   And if you can't remove the data or you forget to, don't worry.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.060]   They wipe the data before they sell it.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.620]   They protect you.
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:25.980]   You can also buy a gazelle.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:26.980]   I like this.
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.900]   They take the best stuff that they buy and they sell it back on gazelle.
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:36.580]   Now here's why this is a good time to do that because they're getting a lot of new stuff.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:39.780]   iPhone 6S is coming in for people who want to get the new iPhone.
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:43.940]   6S Plus is there's iPads, there's Samsung Galaxy phones, and they have a wide range to
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:44.940]   choose from.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:48.540]   They always put every device through a rigorous 30 point inspection to make sure that the
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:51.580]   screen's not scratched and everything works.
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:54.980]   They also back it by a 30 day return policy.
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:58.340]   What's nice is these will work in all the major carriers, but you never are getting
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:00.100]   an extension on your carrier contract.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:01.460]   There's no contract.
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:05.820]   So go to gazelle.com, see what your device is worth, and then check out the selection
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.220]   of certified pre-owned devices.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:12.900]   By the way, they are now offering financing, which I love from a firm, and you can do that
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:13.900]   at checkout.
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:19.580]   Check the box, provide some basic information, approval is instant that you can pay in three,
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:23.420]   six or twelve months using bank transfer or check or debit card.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:26.620]   Just check that box as financing with a firm when you check out.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:32.420]   You can also buy a 12 month warranty on cell phones against water damage, cracked screens,
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.220]   hardware defects, that kind of thing from insurance, and they do offer help processing
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.740]   claims and so forth at gazelle.com.
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:46.140]   The best value on certified pre-owned devices and the best dollars for your pre-owned devices
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:49.740]   when you saw them to gazelle.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.380]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle.com.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:53.820]   Go there today.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.820]   Gina Trapani has a tip of the week for us.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.100]   I do, I do.
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:01.220]   This is courtesy of my alma mater, Life Hacker.
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:03.780]   So I think I've talked about what a big fan of Google Keep I am.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.780]   I really like it with you.
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:06.700]   I didn't make you defend Nick Denton, I just realized.
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:07.700]   You didn't.
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:08.700]   That's right.
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.700]   Go ahead.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:12.700]   We could talk about that over dinner.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.100]   That's the first amendment, I understand.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.100]   I'm in the tank, you know.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   What are you going to do?
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.860]   It's the first amendment.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:21.820]   But it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:24.020]   Go ahead.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.020]   You have a tip for us.
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.420]   That's a tip for us.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:27.420]   Google Keep.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:28.420]   Great to grade out.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.420]   I love Google Keep.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:30.420]   Do you use it with your wife?
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.420]   Do you like?
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.420]   I do.
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.420]   We share notes.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:34.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:35.420]   Shopping lists.
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.420]   This is the stuff I need you to pick up on your way home and that kind of thing.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:38.420]   I have it all on here.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:40.420]   There's a little ad check boxes list.
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.500]   I'm a list maker, that's what I do.
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.740]   Well, there's a voice command.
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.660]   If you've got say a Google Keep note called Shopping List.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.660]   I do right here.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.660]   Or just shopping.
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:50.900]   Sorry, if it's just called Shopping.
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:56.060]   You could use the voice command, add milk to my shopping list and Google will just add
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:58.060]   milk to your list.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:59.060]   Add milk to my--
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:00.060]   Okay, Google.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:01.060]   Okay, Google.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.060]   Stop it.
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.500]   The playlist is not named Shopping List.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.940]   Yeah, you have to have a list name and a note name that.
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:10.540]   So I've got a note called Movies to Watch and I could say, okay, Google, add milk.
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.980]   But you can have an arbitrary name, right?
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.180]   I could say add bacon to my Petaluma market list, right?
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:17.220]   Yes, yeah, that works.
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:19.460]   So I was very excited when that worked.
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:20.460]   That is really nice.
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.460]   It's actually due to this called Shopping.
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.460]   That's something that's been on iOS for a long time.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:24.460]   And it's fact--
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:26.540]   So where does it add it on iOS?
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:28.100]   I think there are reminders.
[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:29.100]   Oh, reminders, yeah.
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:30.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:31.100]   Makes sense.
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.100]   And then I think you can use location too.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.100]   I know you can with Keep.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.100]   I don't know if you can save a location, but you can say when I get to Petaluma, I don't
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:37.100]   know if you can.
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:40.140]   When I get to Petaluma market, remind me to buy chicken.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.420]   I know how people reminders does that.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:44.420]   I know how has location-based reminders.
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:47.420]   Really cool.
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.420]   Isn't that nice?
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:52.420]   So I do that when I get to work, remind me to call Joey and--
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:55.660]   Yeah, that's very, very helpful.
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:57.660]   Keep everybody should be using Keep.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.660]   And the widget is awesome.
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:58:59.660]   I have the widget on my phone.
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:00.660]   I haven't put the widget on the phone.
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.260]   Yeah, and I have a couple of notes that I refer to.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.260]   I just like, you know.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:05.260]   I can do the widget.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:06.260]   There's just got a pretty good widget.
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:07.260]   I love widgets.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.260]   I'm all in on the widget.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:10.260]   You are all in on the widget.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:14.260]   People think I have-- my phone screens are kind of busy because they are.
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.260]   Say that I'm the busy.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:18.260]   They're like Times Square, isn't it?
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.260]   I just saw you flip through 15.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.260]   It's like all sorts of stuff.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]   It's like all sorts of stuff.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:25.380]   Yeah, but those widgets, every one of them, see, that's what I like about as opposed to
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.380]   iOS.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.380]   I've got information.
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:30.260]   Like, there's the New York Times, and I have information on here.
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:32.260]   Yeah, the calendar widget is great.
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.260]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:34.260]   I'm probably showing precious.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.260]   Yeah, you're probably--
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:42.420]   That's the thing that I really miss most about iOS is the widgets or lack thereof on iOS.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.500]   You know, they've got to update their interface.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:50.660]   You can't even-- they don't have an app drawer.
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:54.300]   You can't have like an icon in more than one place.
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.340]   It can only exist in one folder.
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:57.340]   It's crazy.
[01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.180]   It's like the year 2010 or something.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.420]   Yeah, it's very limiting.
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.420]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.420]   Don't get me started.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.180]   It's a non-simplicity of limiting.
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:08.180]   I would like you to give us a number.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.180]   A number?
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:10.180]   A place?
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:11.380]   Both do you make a boat face?
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:14.540]   Do you have a New York accent?
[02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:18.700]   Jarvis, be-- hey, Jarvis McTravis face, give me a number.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:23.460]   So I found this-- so one of the greatest challenges in advertising is what we call attribution.
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:25.740]   Did the ad cause this sale?
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:28.300]   Can I prove that, and can I charge for that?
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.300]   Yes.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:30.300]   So Square--
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.300]   No, I can do that.
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.300]   Well, I'll just wait.
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:34.700]   I'm just going to deal with Facebook to integrate.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:39.980]   So a local advertiser, for example, can buy an ad through Square, and then it does the
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:46.580]   full cycle so that if the customer comes in and buys the thing in the store, you know
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:49.060]   that ad worked on Facebook.
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.500]   Oh, need-o.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.260]   That's very cool.
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:55.420]   Yeah, that's cool.
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:58.740]   That's kind of-- I mean, that's why we use offer codes.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:00.580]   That's the same thing as we do offer codes.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:01.580]   Exactly.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:04.380]   Now, the customer has to go to the effort in that case.
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.380]   That's right.
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:07.380]   If we talk about it, use a great offer code.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.420]   Now says the Square's in customer engagement lead, quote, "The ability to track and close
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:15.660]   the loop from advertisement to sale, that's the holy grail."
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:16.660]   That's true.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.660]   And it runs.
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:19.260]   And then just regular tracking doesn't work for that.
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.340]   Like just the regular link tracking doesn't work.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.460]   Because the store doesn't feedback, doesn't give the information back.
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:26.460]   Exactly.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:31.460]   Now, of course, the larger problem is you decide you're going to go to Bermuda.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:33.140]   And you see an ad.
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:34.820]   And then you go to Wikipedia.
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.300]   And then you go to Travelocity.
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:37.300]   And then you go here.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:38.300]   And you go there.
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:39.300]   So who gets the credit?
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:40.300]   Right.
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:42.140]   It's still never going to be a firm science.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.060]   But it's interesting to me that this potentially increases the value of Facebook and those
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.060]   sales immensely.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:48.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.700]   I wonder if we could do it.
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:54.060]   We can't really do this because we can't-- we don't control the player.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.780]   That's because they control the transaction.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:56.780]   Yes.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.780]   And they can do that.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:01.420]   There was no way we could do that because we don't control the player or the transaction.
[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.020]   We have really no way of doing that.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.020]   OK, never mind.
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:05.020]   I'm not going to do it.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.340]   But that's why people like us.
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:07.340]   We don't track their behavior.
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.340]   Because you can't.
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:12.220]   If you want, if I could, I would.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.540]   My app is a weather app called Bloomsky.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:18.500]   And actually, I found out about this probably, I think it was an Instagram ad.
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:19.500]   I hate those ads.
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:20.500]   I hate it.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:22.300]   That every 10th picture is an ad.
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.660]   There seem a lot like there--
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:25.660]   It's annoying.
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:26.660]   Very frequent recently.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:27.660]   However, it worked.
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:28.660]   I guess so.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:30.300]   Here you are.
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:33.860]   And the reason was I was looking for a weather app so I could see what it would be like in
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.020]   New York when we came here.
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.540]   And I have a lot of weather apps.
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.460]   But what Bloomsky does is it gives you weather cameras.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:44.420]   So for instance, Pierce PC Magazine, they're on Park Avenue.
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:46.780]   And more than that, it will give you a time lapse.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.460]   So this is what it looks like right now.
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:51.780]   But I can say, well, what's the weather been like all day?
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:56.820]   And we'll actually do a time lapse from these Bloomsky cameras of the whole day.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:57.820]   So you can see--
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:01.580]   That's like the old junk and all the president's been selling this ever since the Chronicle
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:04.420]   yesterday's mail because you were too stoned to know what it was.
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:05.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:08.620]   But I like to see the weather from yesterday.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.940]   Sometimes I'm not in Petaluma right now.
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:11.940]   I could see what it was like.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:12.940]   So is there a resist?
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:13.940]   Is there a resist?
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:14.940]   What would you miss?
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:15.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:16.940]   Now the--
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:17.940]   Weather FOMO.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:18.940]   Weather FOMO.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:22.340]   Now the trick on this is you have to have--
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.820]   It has to be a Bloomsky base station.
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:28.140]   They sell these weather stations with cameras built in.
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:29.140]   But they've got them all over.
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:30.660]   In fact, they even checked in Petaluma.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:32.500]   And there are a lot of people in Petaluma that had these.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:37.060]   So I can get to use a word you might like, a hyper local weather forecast.
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:38.060]   There you go.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:39.060]   There's that Bloomsky thing.
[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:43.740]   So this is a time lapse from Bloomsky camera in Petaluma earlier today.
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.580]   So I think it's kind of a neat--
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.580]   That's what you want on your weather.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:51.700]   Is to show you what it will look like in an hour by using the AI to make a picture.
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:52.700]   There's no freaking future.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:53.980]   It's just the past.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:54.980]   It's the Bloomsky thing.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.300]   These are serious cameras.
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.300]   Yeah, but that's also the weather station.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:03:59.300]   Oh, that's the thing.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:03.420]   So it tells you air quality UV temperature, a lot of stuff.
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:04.420]   Wind.
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:05.820]   And you can go to Bloomsky.com and see these.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:08.060]   I mean, there's also the website.
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:10.260]   But I don't know.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:12.420]   Unfortunately, the Bloomsky's are kind of expensive.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:13.420]   They're like $300.
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:14.420]   I'm really tempted.
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:15.420]   They look tempted.
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.420]   Nice.
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:17.420]   Because it'd be kind of cool to know what the--
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:18.420]   You're tempted to buy something you don't need.
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:20.660]   Yeah, well, I haven't bought it yet.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.620]   But I'm very tempted to-- because it'd be kind of nice to look at your backyard and
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.620]   see what the weather was.
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:26.620]   Oh, that's true.
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:27.620]   You're right.
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:28.620]   It's weird.
[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:29.620]   It's backwards weather.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:30.620]   It is.
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.620]   It's what happened.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:32.620]   Enough.
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:33.620]   What's going to happen.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:34.620]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:35.620]   I mean, they have regular weather in it, too.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:36.620]   But I kind of like just looking at the day.
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.620]   Yeah, the site has some nice--
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.620]   It's pretty, isn't it?
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:39.620]   Yeah, boom.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:40.620]   Full-age in Autumn.
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:41.620]   Full-age in Denver.
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:42.620]   Looks like--
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:43.620]   I think the camera gets rained on.
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:44.620]   It's rain.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:45.620]   Mostly just rain.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.100]   Hey, this has been really fun.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:49.660]   We should just do the-- let's move to it in New York.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:50.660]   I would love to do that.
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:51.660]   There you go.
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.660]   I don't know if I get Lisa to go.
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:54.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:55.660]   How are rents here?
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:56.660]   They're pretty good, right?
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:57.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:04:58.660]   You're very affordable.
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:59.660]   No problem at all.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:00.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:01.660]   I just got off the Staten Island and you'll really get a deal.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:03.660]   I could tell, by the way, that rents were--
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:04.660]   It's crazy.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:08.220]   --we're going up because we went to get a slice when we got in the morning and went to get
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:09.220]   a slice.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.220]   That's what you do, right?
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.220]   Right.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.220]   Well, you can do it before--
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.220]   No one can afford to own a pizza place in New York anymore.
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:15.660]   There's no-- where did all the rays go?
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:17.460]   They must have moved down down or something.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:18.460]   There's nothing around here.
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:19.460]   It's too expensive.
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:20.460]   There was enough pizza.
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:21.460]   There was enough pizza for the time.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.460]   If you think about it, $20 is square foot.
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.460]   $90 a minute.
[02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:28.460]   You're not going to be able to make someone have pizza to make that worth while.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.460]   There's no Howard Johnson's on Times Square anymore.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:31.460]   You used to be.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:32.460]   Right?
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.460]   There was an Howard Johnson's.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:34.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.460]   Wow, Howard Johnson's old.
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.460]   No Nathan's.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:38.460]   Yeah, no Nathan's anymore.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:39.460]   No papayas.
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:40.460]   No papayas.
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:41.460]   No papayas.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.460]   That's right.
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.460]   That's right.
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:44.460]   That's right.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:45.460]   That was worth the days.
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:46.460]   No strip joints.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:49.460]   Nathan's in Coney Island, which is where needed to be.
[02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.460]   I figured that.
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:51.460]   We're used to being on Times Square.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.460]   Right.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:53.460]   Yeah, it's just the rent.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:54.460]   The rent was too much.
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.460]   And down at the village, the papaya king is gone.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.460]   Oh, that one down on the bus road?
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.460]   Yeah, yeah, that's gone.
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.460]   This is a really amazing place.
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:06.460]   I have to say, this CUNY school of graduate school journalism is a gorgeous facility.
[02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:07.460]   Yes.
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:09.460]   In the heart of Times Square, you're really in a great location.
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:12.460]   Those kids who are studying here are very, very lucky.
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:13.460]   Next one, the Times.
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:14.460]   Right, next one, Times.
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.460]   Yeah.
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:16.460]   Oh, man, look at this studio.
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:18.460]   You've got a television studio.
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:19.460]   So thank you.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:23.460]   And I really want to thank the guys that was at George and who else?
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.460]   Guys, say your names.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:26.460]   Sebastian.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.460]   Sebastian.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:29.460]   I can't even see who's been camera operators.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:30.460]   Oh, here's.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:31.460]   Oh, here's Eddie.
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:38.460]   Oh, Eddie, hey, Sam's back there.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:41.460]   Who else has a camera?
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.460]   Byron.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.460]   Byron.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:44.460]   Byron.
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:45.460]   Byron.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:46.460]   All right, thank you, guys.
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:47.460]   Yeah, thank you.
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.460]   This is like, we get like, like it's real TV.
[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:50.460]   Yeah, these are some serious lights.
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.460]   Serious.
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:52.460]   Serious.
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.460]   So we thank you all.
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:55.460]   I can stand for a little more heat from them, though.
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:56.460]   Chilling in there.
[02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:57.460]   Chilling in there.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:58.460]   No, all studios.
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:06:59.460]   We like studios to be cold.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:00.460]   And of course I have.
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:01.460]   I have a basketball team.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:03.460]   They're going all the way this year.
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.460]   I have a feeling.
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:05.460]   [laughter]
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.460]   Hey, thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.460]   We do this week in Google, even in New York.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:14.460]   Roundabout 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern time.
[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:15.460]   That's 2030 UTC.
[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:17.460]   You can watch live on Wednesdays.
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:21.460]   If you can't watch live, do get the audio or video.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:23.460]   We offer every show on demand at our website.
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:25.460]   In this case, twit.tv/twig.
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:29.460]   And you can also subscribe on your favorite podcatcher or use one of those great Twit apps.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:30.460]   Lots of them.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:35.460]   All of our third party developers have created some great apps on every platform, including
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:36.460]   Roku and Apple.
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.460]   There's five Apple TV apps.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:40.460]   We have a great newsletter if you want to subscribe.
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:41.460]   It's free.
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.460]   We don't even put ads in it because who needs money?
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:48.460]   Twit.tv/newsletter if you'd like to subscribe.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.460]   It's a double opt-in.
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:52.460]   We make sure that nobody can sign you up for it unless you really want it.
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:54.460]   But it'll let you know what's coming up on the week ahead on Twit.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:58.460]   Thanks to Jason Clantus back in the studio for running the board, making things happen.
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:00.460]   Thanks to all of you for being here.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:03.460]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:10.460]   [Music]
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.520]   (music)
