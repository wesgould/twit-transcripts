[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.260]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stasis here, Jeff's here, and here the whole team's assembled.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.720]   President Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.820]   We'll find out how ridiculous this lawsuit really is.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.820]   The Pentagon is canceling its $10 billion Jedi contract.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.560]   And Russian hackers have really topped themselves with this latest ransomware attack.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.860]   It's all that. And a lot more coming up on Twig.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.440]   [MUSIC]

[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.200]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show we cover everything there is to know about Google and elsewhere.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.480]   Stacey Higginbotham's here.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.280]   She's our IoT and Chip Guru from staceyoniot.com at Gigastacey.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.800]   On the Twitter.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   Hello there, Stacey.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   Hello.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.440]   I should tell you, just a couple of days ago, I tweeted my nanoleaf set up.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.960]   We'll find that at some point and show it to you.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.600]   Oh, I can't wait to see it.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.800]   You know, our new, they call it a P-O-E.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   It's our...
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.600]   Power over Ethernet?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   No.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.400]   Actually, that is one of the things for you.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.880]   I can't remember what it says.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's our new HR payroll system.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.240]   It's in Sperity.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.680]   They call their software Higginbotham.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.840]   Does it sound like something you could like a butler?
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   You could order a round?
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   Or a Jarvis.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   Yes.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   Higginbotham.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   Crank out the payroll.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.880]   Jarl, let's put the hot dogs on the grill.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.240]   I thought that was the funniest thing ever.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.400]   Oh, so now you actually have a Jarvis and a Higginbotham.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Yes.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   Now you just need to prove it.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   Yes.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   If they would come up with something that's called "Pruit."
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.360]   What would the Pruitt software do?
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   That's the amp-pruit.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.080]   He's a host of Hands-On Photography.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   Regular on this show and a good man all round.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Good man to have.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   I'm trying.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   All round.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.840]   Despite the fact that he works out in black socks, I'm not going to mention it.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.280]   I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   It's just weird.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   We always talk about that with Lisa this morning because I now have a drawer full of
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   white socks.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.680]   We both bought me some white socks, so I now have a lifetime supply.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.760]   I remember when I was a kid in junior high, they said, "You're not allowed to wear anything
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920]   but white socks to gym class."
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   Yep.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.400]   They implied that it would somehow poison you if you wore dark socks.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   That's not right.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.160]   All the black socks.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.560]   Crazed came back in the 90s, way back in the day.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.080]   With the Fab Five Michigan basketball team.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   Oh.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Fab Freshman.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.720]   They wore black socks and they wanted to wear long, short pants.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.080]   That was their style.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.360]   I jumped on that bandwagon and I've just been wearing black socks.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.560]   It's actually thought out.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   Fascinating.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.320]   Now I feel weird if I wear gray or white socks.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.360]   I feel old when I wear it.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.920]   Like I'm in the 50s, like I'm the fawns or something when I'm wearing white socks.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.360]   Well, some of those make it look good.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   You rock those white socks.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   You rock them.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.160]   Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Leonard Tau Professor
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   for journalistic innovation at the...
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   Craig.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   Craig.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   Craig.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   Newmark.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.480]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.000]   We just never get that right.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.680]   I put my new socks.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   I just put it in the chat there.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.680]   I have new socks too.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.360]   You have Gutenberg socks.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   Gutenberg socks.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.760]   Do they say, let me see here, do they say Gutenberg on them?
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   Nice.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   In a very nice...
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   Oh, those are nice.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   From the University of Texas?
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.560]   Gothic script.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.160]   I have seen their Gutenberg Bible on many occasions.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   Oh, really?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   They used to live across the street from it.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160]   Is it famous?
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's one of two in the two intact Gutenbergs?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   Yeah, Yale had one at the Bineke Library, but I don't think they sold socks to go with
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   it.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.760]   See, I'd work out no socks.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.240]   These are nice because they're both black and white.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.920]   You get the best of both worlds.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.960]   I dig it.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.720]   Okay.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.880]   That's black letter, right?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   This is...
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.600]   So this is the first twig in history, I think, in which we're starting the show with an absolutely
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.960]   empty Google box.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   Is there nothing in the Google box?
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   There's Google stuff else, but there's nothing in the Google box.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.760]   It is empty.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Wow.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.680]   That sounds you something.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   There is a change plug.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   We'll get to that.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   I went looking.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.080]   And Google is in the top story.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   There's what?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   Yes, there's soup.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   They got...
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   No, it's...
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   They're getting sued.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   Oh, yeah, by the president.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   It's...
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   Well, there's that too.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.920]   Well, and what's weird is it's the class action lawsuit.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.000]   Twitter, Facebook, and Google, plus CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   for banning him.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.160]   And I love...
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   You have to read Tech Dirt's take on this.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.640]   Mike Masnick, always great.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.360]   It can always get dumber.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.600]   That's the department.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   Trump's who's claiming his own government violated the Constitution.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.400]   It's a lawsuit in the state of Florida.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.760]   Of course, of course, where else would it be?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.520]   Count One says that Twitter, Facebook, and Google's YouTube, removing Trump from their
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.360]   platforms violates the First Amendment, which of course, constitutional scholars, or
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.920]   even some dim bulbs who've just read the damn thing will note that the Constitution only
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.400]   forbids the government from making any law of rich free speech.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.520]   Unless somehow, well, actually a little later in the suit, he does kind of assert that
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.720]   Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are the government.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   Right.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.520]   Which is because on the basis of section 230, which is what he wants to remove by the suit.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.340]   He says that these private companies violated his First Amendment rights by conspiring
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.960]   with the government he led at the time.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   [laughter]
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.080]   To his platform.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.800]   I mean, this will be immediately thrown out, but of course there's will.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Will it?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   The judges will.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.240]   Just as the judge threw it out the floor, the Florida thing put out a temporary judge.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.440]   But the aunt, that's not the point.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.960]   He got what he wanted, which is exactly what we're doing right now, which is the intention.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   And fundraising.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   And fundraising.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.120]   Because immediately emails went out to all the donors saying, "Help, you know, President
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.760]   Trump fight the good fight, and that's a good way to make money."
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.680]   The second claim says that it wants to clarify judgment.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.600]   The section 230 are much revered section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.080]   Is itself or is no, it's not Communications Decency Act.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   It's telecommunication.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.680]   Well, this is the funny thing.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.400]   In the suit they call it the Community Decency Act.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.360]   When it is, in fact, the Community Decency Act.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.880]   Jeff Kossoff and I traded this on Twitter and I said, "Well, of course, I have argued
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.760]   for a long time that the community is community."
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.920]   They claim that it's unconstitutional in censoring.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.040]   Plaintiff and the class, defendants relied upon an act that pursuant to section 230
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.480]   of the Communications Decency Act.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.600]   Defendants would not have deplatformed plaintiff or similarly situated, putative class members,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.200]   but for the immunity purportedly offered by section 230.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.080]   It might have been, in fact, quite the opposite as Mike Masnick on the Techter points out,
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.640]   because had these companies not had immunity from lawsuits, they might have banned them
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   faster.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   Yes.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   Not slower, faster.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   Faster.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   Back to the, as Mike Masnick calls it, lawsuit.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   I love Mike.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   He's the greatest.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.960]   Let's see.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:16.080]   By the way, and this was the argument in favor of Florida's social media moderation law,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.120]   and that, of course, was thrown out of court.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.200]   At least there was an injunction.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400]   It was first laughed at in court.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   Let's see.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   There's a ton of other garbage rights, Mack, mostly performative throat clearing.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.440]   None of that really matters beyond the two laughably dumb claims.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.840]   Mike writes, "I did want to call out a few really, really stupid points, though.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.400]   In the Twitter lawsuit, Trump's lawyers misleading his site the night First Amendment institutes
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.160]   suit against Trump for blocking users.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.560]   This is a suit they won because they said the president can't block users on Twitter
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.760]   if he's going to use his account to make official statements.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.120]   In the pleadings, Trump's attorneys wrote in Biden versus tonight, the Supreme Court
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.800]   discussed, wasn't the court, as Mike points out, it was Clarence Thomas.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.560]   He discussed the Second Circuit's decision holding the plaintiff's threads on Twitter
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.480]   from his personal account were, in fact, official presidential statements made in a public
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   forum.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:35.600]   Likewise, President Trump would discuss government activity in Twitter in his official capacity.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   What's weird is, in the night case, President Trump's argument was that his Twitter account
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   was not his official account.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.800]   Was his personal account.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.880]   That was his argument for saying, "I need to be able to block people because it's my
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   personal account."
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.680]   Now he's saying, "Oh, no, this is my official government.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.280]   This is my government account."
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.440]   Point being he's a private citizen.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.960]   Now I think he might have had a case when he was president, but he's not now.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.520]   He's a private citizen.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   I can't imagine.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   What case would he have had?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.840]   What case would he possibly have had?
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   There's no compelled speech.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.400]   In fact, that would be a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   Yes.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   The federal government said you cannot ban the president.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   You must carry this.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   You must carry government speech.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   These are private companies.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   That's a good point.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:30.160]   So he says in Clause 82, it goes on very long time, folks, he said that you're relying
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.920]   on the permissible language in Section 230, a statement of actions of Democrat legislators.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.320]   Those legislators made it clear they had a strong preference for censoring the views
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.720]   of da da da da.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.600]   For example, COVID-19 air quotes misinformation, including the lack of safety and efficacy
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.440]   of hydroxychloroquine and the use of face masks.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.760]   COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan province of China, was a transmission from scientists
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.160]   and a government, and questioning the integrity and results of the 2020 presidential.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.640]   Oh, he actually got that in too.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   He did.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   He got it all in.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   It's the greatest hits.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   It's amazing.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   It's amazing.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   It's amazing.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.680]   I mean, it's the greatest disinformation hits.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   I mean, so there you go.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680]   There's the lawsuit.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.920]   You tweeted about it a little bit, Jeff, earlier today.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.360]   I love it that they called it the Community Decency Act.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:33.320]   When they said, I love paragraph 51, the comments generated by Plato's Facebook posts also give
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.240]   rise to important public discussion and debate about government policy.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.680]   Typically his posts would generate thousands of replies posted by users, some of which
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.040]   would generate hundreds or thousands of replies in return.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.560]   All of them, of course, incredibly intelligent.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.240]   President Trump's account was a digital town hall in which the president of the United States
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.720]   communicated with his music here, communicated news and information to the public directly.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.000]   Members of the public use the reply function to respond directly to President Trump and
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   that is all that is.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   That is untrue.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.520]   That's all true.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   That's exactly true.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.640]   I don't know how it protects his.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.080]   Well, it's just ridiculous characterization.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   It's not.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.080]   It's untrue.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.080]   I mean, that's where that's how there was a discussion to policy, but well, yeah, there
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   was.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.160]   I mean, he might not have read it, but there certainly was in response to it.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   No, that's stupid.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.960]   I don't think it makes any difference in terms of whether a private company can say any
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.480]   buddy, nobody has the right, even the former president of the United States to have an
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.760]   account on Twitter, Facebook or YouTube.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.920]   I mean, that's, I don't know how you can, how any government held speech is not free
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   speech.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.080]   So it's just a complete misunderstanding of, I guess, the Constitution, but we'll see what
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.600]   the courts do with this.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.320]   There is a, there is a slap loss law on the books in Florida.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:08.560]   So that might allow Twitter to be very interesting if Twitter, Facebook and Google are, or their
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   respective CEOs countersued asking for legal costs.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.400]   First, first, I would engage.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.360]   I would want nothing, nothing to do.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   Your honor, really?
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.600]   First, the corporate lawyers have to stop laughing on Zoom and then figure out what to
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   do.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.920]   By the way, the president's team did launch a new social network.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.520]   I didn't mention it last week.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.880]   Which, the former president, please?
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:41.000]   Former president, Gator, G-E-T-T-R, launched by one of his former spokespeople, Jason Miller,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   immediately hacked.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680]   I mean, literally the day it launched, it got compromised.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.920]   They got compromised the day it launched.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:55.600]   And then shortly after information about all of the account holders was exfiltrated.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Oh boy.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.960]   So maybe they want to work on their security a little bit.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   Parler got hacked.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.840]   Remember, Twitter's been hacked, but not quite so dramatically.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.320]   And certainly not on its first day.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   Not on its first day.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   Jeez.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.440]   Well, on Twitter's first day, it just was down for most of it.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   Oh yeah, it fell away.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   It fell away.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.240]   Twitter's first day nobody knew it.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.800]   That's the real truth.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   That's the real truth.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.320]   Twitter took a while to take off.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.480]   All right, moving right along.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.960]   Pentagon has canceled the Jedi Cloud contract.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.840]   This was another somewhat political decision.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:47.400]   The Pentagon needed a new secure cloud for all of branches of the service, all the different
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.560]   services.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.840]   They bid it out, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle all tried.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.960]   I think did Walmart try to get it on this?
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.440]   Everybody tried to get it on it.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   Eventually it was awarded to Microsoft Amazon promptly soo, saying the president, former
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.480]   president has thumb on the scale because he didn't like Jeff Bezos.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.880]   And it's taken so long now because of the suits that the Pentagon just threw up its hands
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   and said, you know what?
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   Forget it.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.360]   It's just dragging out.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.680]   So we're going to try something else, which they should have tried in the first place,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.960]   which is a multi-cloud solution.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.520]   Oh, well, no.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.280]   Okay, saying you should do multi-cloud in the first place from going to your own disparate
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.520]   systems instead of to one cloud.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.640]   That's like saying, you know what?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.440]   Instead of for my first house, I'm going to buy a house.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.040]   I instead am going to buy an entire apartment complex, live in it, manage it, and offer
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.280]   the first floor as.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.400]   Yeah, but it is the Pentagon.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.440]   And I think they probably have the resources to buy a bigger house.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.840]   They have the money.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.680]   They don't have the expertise.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   Well, that's why.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.600]   And in fact, wouldn't you prefer that instead of having just Microsoft or just Google or
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.280]   just Amazon doing it, having the best minds for three companies?
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280]   No.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.520]   I have seen so many in the years I have covered cloud computing.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.440]   I have seen many a good company try to build their own cloud and fail utterly.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.280]   It's very hard.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.040]   But go for it, Pentagon.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.760]   And just because in many companies are like, I am IBM.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   I can do it.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Thank you.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   Not.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:33.480]   Well, the new JWCC, which I'm trying to find with that acronym, joint warfighter cloud capability.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.880]   Oh, God.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   Will be a multi-vendor contract this time.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.360]   They're going to bid it again.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.040]   And they said, actually, Google's been left out.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.120]   They said they're going to ask for proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft saying they're
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.240]   the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.000]   So it may be half to Amazon through a tantrum.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.560]   And they're like, fine, just do it this way.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.920]   This is our government's problem.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.720]   We don't stick to our guns.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Sorry.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   I just.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:17.440]   Well, yeah, okay.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.080]   Microsoft said that the legal fight over the Jedi contract was evidence that their reform
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.520]   was needed in the process.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.000]   And I hate agreeing with Microsoft, but dang, I agree with my.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   And they won the process.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.840]   So they knew what a mess it was.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.240]   They were like, this is going to suck.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   Hello.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.440]   So it's a big contract, a billion dollar a year contract for 10 years.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:50.400]   I don't know what the JWCC dollar amount will be, but it's a big important contract.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.320]   Amazon stock up Microsoft stock down on the news, but it could bid for other things.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.720]   Could be for lots of things.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   We don't.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   And I don't mean it's a big deal, but AWS revenue.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.280]   Have you seen any big changes in Amazon over the last couple of days?
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   Cause Jeff Bezos is no longer CEO Andy Jassy's in charge.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.840]   It's a different company.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.120]   Actually one of the things right before Jeff Bezos stepped down on Monday, they did add
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:34.240]   a couple of more bullet points to their leadership principles, which maybe were designed to
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:42.680]   make it seem like a more responsible and caring company.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.960]   The new leadership principles strive to be the earth's best employer.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.600]   And that's new.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.280]   Success and scale bring broad responsibility.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.600]   The new principles require employees to take into account the well-being of their coworkers
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.760]   and society beyond the company's walls when making decisions.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.840]   They also address persistent criticisms of the company as a bruising workplace and
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.400]   in considerate corporate citizen.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.680]   This was something Bezos kind of alluded to in his last shareholder letter, but I think
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.880]   this is a response to the criticism Amazon's been getting.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   And I wonder if this is something Andy Jassy had a hand in.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.560]   But didn't I also see a story from Bezos debunking the whole work-life balance thought
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.840]   and basically called it a fallacy?
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.680]   You can't have both.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.320]   And by the way, I'm taking my money and I'm going into space by life.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.840]   Yep, see you.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.320]   That's how you find work-life balance.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   You quit.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.600]   You know, I think this was within a week.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:57.040]   It's widely considered that Amazon is a well-run company from the corporate governance point
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.560]   of view, but I think there's also a lot of thought that maybe it's not the best company
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.440]   for its employees.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.840]   At least they're discussing it.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.680]   Yeah, because they had that sort of principles.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   So now let's just get the ball rolling and have some action on it.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.240]   So it'd be interesting to see what Andy Jassy does with Amazon.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.800]   I imagine it's, you know, hold the course, but at some point--
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.600]   So the stock went up like mad and that's not because it was Bezos' last day.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   The stock market thinks at least two days ahead.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.720]   I don't know why.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   The tight government contract?
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.360]   It's not that valuable.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   Can't be.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.600]   No, it isn't that valuable.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.320]   I don't know.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.680]   I don't understand the stock market.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   It's Stacy Knows.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.880]   Oh, no, nobody does.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.960]   Stacy Knows that I believe is disconnected from reality, but that's what I--
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   I don't think it's-- yeah, I think you're probably right.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.600]   But I can't believe that it's totally divorced from reality, but I could be wrong.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.800]   Well, now the Reddit has arrived.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   It's totally divorced real.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   I think it always was.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   It's the--
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.400]   I think it's less Reddit and more the fact that young people can trade stocks easily on
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   Robinhood.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   Now that--
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   Oh, don't blame young people.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   Come on.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   You could play more in Buffett just as much.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.360]   How about the democratization of stock trading?
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   Maybe.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   I don't-- yeah.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.120]   I guess that's-- when you look at GameStop and AMC and the diamond hands on Reddit, that
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.920]   maybe that is because it got cheaper and easier to trade.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.160]   Those meme stonks.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   Meme stonks.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.280]   Let's take a little break, and then we'll go to the empty Google section.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.720]   Where we sit inside.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.880]   I look like four or five times.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.520]   I went back to search Google News for news on Google, and the cover was there.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.080]   And it's a college thinking there's just not a lot.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.360]   There's not a lot of news for any of the shows.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.120]   No, Stacy, this is just proving Leo's point last week that Google's not boring.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.240]   By the way, Robinhood has filed for an IPO if you want to talk a little bit about Robinhood.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.360]   And this is according to the--
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   What?
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   That was producing it.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   All right, we'll break the break.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   We'll read this on the phone.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:21.160]   But the filing, which was released on Thursday, Robinhood disclosed that 81% of its revenue
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.800]   in the first quarter came from sending its customers stock options and cryptocurrency
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.960]   orders to high-speed trading firms.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.360]   In other words, they got payment for order flow.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   That's-- because remember, Robinhood doesn't charge you a commission for trading.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.240]   They have to make money somewhere.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.480]   But PFOF, which is an excellent acronym, payment for order flow, PFOF, makes it possible for
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   Robinhood's--
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   PFOF, PFOF.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Let's--
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   The Germans would say--
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   PFOF.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.160]   As they say in the German, FFF.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   FFF.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.240]   Let's-- customers place trade with no upfront commission payments.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.880]   And that's one of the ways they get younger, less affluent customers.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.280]   It's the standard practice now.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.920]   Many competitors because Robinhood set the bar.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:12.520]   And for order flow critics, including security exchange commission chairman Gary Gensler,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.880]   don't like the practice.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.600]   They say it poses a conflict of interest for brokerages because the brokers can either
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.080]   collect more money for selling their customers' order flow or pass that money on to customers
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.800]   in the form of price savings on their trades.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.400]   I've always heard that one of the problems with using Robinhood is they make money on
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   the spread.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.240]   But I guess really where they make money is PFOF and the order payment for order flow.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   So interesting.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   We're learning--
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   Let me just understand.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.960]   The payment for order flow is telling people what's been ordered on a timely basis now.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   So I take your order for a stock and then I offer it to somebody, a trader.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.000]   But what I do is I say, well, who's going to give me the most money for this order?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.720]   And Stacey says, I'll give you a buck for it.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.640]   And that's where I get my money.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.280]   Yeah, it's kind of like kayak.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.560]   The problem is--
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.320]   Well, why does Stacey take that order?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   Why does Stacey--
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   She's not going to pay.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   Where does that money come from?
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   Well, in my opinion, and am I maybe wrong on this, correct me, please, is it comes from
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.560]   the spread.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   So these high-speed trading firms maybe don't have the most advantageous spread from the
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.680]   point of view of the person buying this stock.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   Right.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:35.480]   They'll give me a price.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.160]   When I sell my stock, they'll say, OK, you made a buck a share.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.040]   But I may only make 50 cents a share from another trader.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.520]   And if Robinhood is choosing the trader that pays them the most money, it's likely they're
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   also choosing the trader that has the worst spread from the point of view of the consumer.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.480]   So it's a trading desk for trades?
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.640]   So you may say, as a consumer, hey, this is great.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.720]   No commission.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.000]   But the price you're getting, the price you're paying for a stock or the price you're getting
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.560]   paid when you sell a stock is not going to be as good as it should be because they're
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.520]   getting the price from one of these--
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.280]   But is that increment that you're losing more than the commission was?
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   So no.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   That's a good question.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   That's a real calculation.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.840]   Well, it's less of a huge spread thing and more of a scaled thing.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   The bigger your chunks-- because the big trading firms, they don't trade in small like 10 shares,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   right?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.280]   They're aggregating and moving.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:43.640]   So I feel like there's an advantage to them to do--
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.680]   PFOF is illegal in the UK.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.080]   There are countries that ban it because for a variety of reasons.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.800]   It is not illegal currently in the United States, although some Democrats on Capitol Hill are
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.680]   considering making it illegal.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   Prohibiting PFOF might force, as the journal might force some brokerage is to abandon zero
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.520]   commission trading.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.800]   I think the issue is if you're buying a million shares for $35 commission or you're buying
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.520]   one share for $35 commission, that makes a big difference.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.040]   And the spread makes a much bigger difference for you if you're trading a lot of shares.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   I don't know.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   Well, yes.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.160]   The more-- so I just found an entire paper called "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.640]   Payment for Order Flow" that came out in May from--
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.360]   So I'm going to do an ad while you read that and report back.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   Oh, really?
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.720]   Ms. Higginbotham, your assignment.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.400]   Should you choose to accept it?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.120]   Is to explain why PFOF could be--
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.840]   Or at least read that first-- the handy first paragraph.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   Yeah, she says.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.840]   More than any of us would be--
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   On page eight, hold on.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   Thank you.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.280]   Oh, you're way beyond anything.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   We would.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.880]   Payment for Order Flow has existed for decades, says the journal.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:06.200]   The SEC has reviewed the practice several times and allowed it to continue.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.920]   To date, they've accepted the argument put forward by many brokers and traders is sending
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:16.640]   retail orders to high-speed traders' benefits, small investors, proponents of PFOF say investors
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.280]   save money when their orders are routed to such trading firms compared to what they've
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.760]   get at exchanges like New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   Huh.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   It's--
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.520]   They're actually talking about it becoming part of a pool of what they call unpublished
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:40.640]   liquidity that means that people don't understand the actual cost of buying and selling the
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   stock.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   Yeah, it hides that, right.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.320]   So then these people get kind of an information advantage.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   That's where they were--
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.360]   That's what I was thinking, yes.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.200]   Yeah, high-speed traders, the smallest advantage can make a huge difference, right?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   That's interesting.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   Okay.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   All right, well, this is beyond my pay--
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   Just a bit of a broker.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   Now you know.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.280]   That was a bit of a-- but, you know, I can send a link to the paper to somebody if they
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   want it.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.200]   Somebody, because you know--
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   Check.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.440]   --the other side of the market.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.520]   I'm going on vacation in a five days.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   I don't care.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.240]   No, no, no.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   I'll read it on the beach.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   Yeah, send it to me.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.360]   I'll read it when I go to Hawaii.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.280]   I need something to read.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.440]   I don't believe this.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, I showed it.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   They brought to you by Melissa, the address experts.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.960]   With the world starting to reopen, it might be time to get reacquainted with your customers.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:44.760]   But you know, in the year of the quarantine, 30% of that customer data has now gone bad.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.960]   Sometimes change addresses, emails, phone numbers.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.200]   Stop throwing your money away.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.160]   Let Melissa help you.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.840]   People love Melissa with a renewal rate of over 92%.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.040]   Companies obviously value what Melissa does, and so will you.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.720]   Melissa, make sure your data is accurate and current, so you reach the right customers.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.800]   There are tools of help businesses maintain fresh data now for 35 years.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.880]   Over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.160]   It starts with Melissa's Global Address Verification Service, which can verify addresses for 240
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.360]   plus countries and territories.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.800]   You can even do it at the point of entry.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.720]   You've got an API so that you can actually add it to your own software.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.080]   So when your customer service rep or your customer himself is entering that data, you
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.880]   can verify it and not just addresses, emails, phone numbers and names.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.640]   And if you're tired of having duplicate customer information in your database, that costs you
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.720]   money, sending out multiple catalogs, that kind of thing, Melissa's data matching can
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.560]   help you eliminate clutter and duplicates and increase the accuracy of your database, plus
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.720]   save your money.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.360]   Plus, you'll get information that completes your customer profiles better.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.920]   Add public information like marital status or social media handles.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   Melissa's flexible deployment options offer different platforms to suit any preference.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.840]   You can get it on-prem.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.200]   Of course, you can get it as a web service.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.440]   There's SAS delivery.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.240]   They even have a secure FTP site you can upload and download.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.920]   And by the way, check out the new lookup apps from Melissa on iOS and Android, which will
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.120]   help you search addresses, names and more right at your fingertips.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.160]   Don't worry, whenever you use Melissa, your data is 100% safe.

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   Bottom line, make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.280]   It's eroding as we speak.

[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:47.160]   Melissa.com/twit, we thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.680]   Let's see.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.800]   Wow, Robinhood earned 75% of their income from PFOP.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.720]   Well, they're in the...
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   It's now...
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.400]   Yeah, 81% in the last quarter.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.600]   That was even more.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.640]   That was the headline in that journal story, 81%.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   That's how they make...
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.280]   Well, they don't charge commissions, so they've got to make money somehow.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.600]   I don't know, I think this is a...
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.360]   Bernie Needle came up with this thing.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.520]   Oh, then you know it's bad.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.040]   Well, Bernie Madoff came up with PFOPs?
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   PFOP?
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   No, kidding.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   Oh, geez.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   That is not off to the conclusion.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   That has cooties.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   Oh, yeah, I got another idea.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   So...
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   So there you go.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   That was one of his...
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   Wow.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.880]   The practice of PFOP began decades ago, was made stream by the controversial figure Bernie
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.720]   Madoff, made off himself, who once justified paying retail brokers by comparing the practice
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.800]   to hiring salespeople on commission to bring order flow to a broker.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.040]   Deal flows everything as my wife continually tells me.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   Oh, crap on a cracker.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.960]   Casea, that's what they're saying.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.040]   That's what all the MSPs who use Casea are saying right now, crap on a cracker.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:12.840]   Casea is the latest supply chain attack we talked about yesterday on security now.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   This is...
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.520]   Casea, which provides monitoring services for managed service providers who provide IT
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.920]   services for small businesses.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.200]   We use that managed service provider for instance.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.680]   It means that this is a great leverage point, because if you can get these managed service
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.160]   providers, you get into each of their customers.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.480]   You might get hundreds per MSP.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:42.720]   The CEO of Casea estimates anywhere from 800 to 1500 people have been ransomware.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:50.400]   So far, the biggest, most notable, Swedish supermarket chain co-op, or is it coop, closed
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:57.360]   800 stores because they couldn't accept any money because their cash registers were down.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.000]   This is the Reeville ransomware gang.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.600]   If you're interested in this stuff, Steve goes into this in detail.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.800]   This week he talks a lot about the Casea and Reeville.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.880]   Next week he's going to talk about some of their software, the actual encryption software.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.040]   He's going to do a deep dive, which will be very interesting.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   What does he recommend for protection?
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.480]   I know we've talked about this before where you're kind of screwed, but is there...
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   Is there anything that just companies...
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.120]   You know, there is no magic bullet in security.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.280]   And he talks about this.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.720]   It's a layered process.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.160]   Having a great backup is certainly a start, but it's not the only thing training your employees.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.040]   You got to do that too.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.720]   And honestly, you know, a lot of times the problem really is the IT department knows what
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.000]   to do, but they're not well-funded.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.480]   It's a cost center from the point of view of the board and the executives, and they just
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   underfund them.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.360]   They don't take it seriously enough until they get bit.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.680]   Maybe now they're going to start taking it a little bit more seriously.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   And then sometimes...
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.600]   Tell me just the executive order.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   Oh, sorry.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   Go ahead.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.040]   The executive order that Biden signed May 12th is something that's going to apply to some
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.120]   of these cases.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.280]   So this was their effort to...
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   What's the word I'm looking for?
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.360]   He created a task force, right?
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.160]   No, he actually signed an executive order that is going to require people to...
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.600]   So it requires NIST and SISA to...
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.240]   They have 90 days to come up...
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.200]   Well, the executive order takes effect 90 days from May 12th when he issued it, but they
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:41.000]   have up to a year to come up with policies to prevent supply chain attacks and software
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.520]   as a result of SolarWinds.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.120]   And so some of the things...
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.200]   Now, what's unclear, or there are lots of things that are unclear.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:53.720]   Well, one of the things that's kind of a little wonky about it is from the day the order was
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.080]   adopted, so May 12th, your stuff has to be compliant, but we don't actually know all
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   the rules yet.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.200]   Like, even it is just actually released some crucial definitions just last week.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.240]   And some of this is reporting requirements, which really is a big part of it.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.960]   It's like the breach reporting requirements that GDPR introduced.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.600]   A lot of times people don't want to admit this is happening, and that lack of information
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.480]   really allows this stuff to spread a lot farther, a lot faster.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:29.320]   So some of this is you have to report if you are breached service requirements.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   Well, and there's like...
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   You need to collect information.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.120]   Yeah, this is good.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.400]   I'm looking at the order.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.320]   I mean, it's just an executive order, and so there's some question about how much can be
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.600]   done by executive order.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   Is this like the whole Sarbanes-Otsley movement from 15 years ago?
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.240]   Yeah, a little bit, huh.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.840]   He also, part of the order was modernizing federal government cybersecurity, because they've
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.320]   been bit in the past by supply chains.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.720]   SolarWinds hit a lot of different level departments.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   So yeah, there's definitely stuff that needs to be done.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.680]   I think it's more than an executive order, but it's certainly a start.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:16.040]   And what I remember with SOTS was the whole audit scare, where I worked at it seems like
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.520]   we were always dealing with some auditor and was going to face X amount of dollars if this
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.760]   wasn't in compliance and yada yada yada.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.320]   So it's just a scare of SOCK, Crap, and the reporting requirements.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.560]   Well, yeah, these things will have consequences, but I would argue that they implement it.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.720]   Of course, you're getting around SOCKs now by implementing SPACs.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.200]   So I'm kind of like, "Eh, where are we going to adapt?"
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.080]   Yes, but this is going to be a good thing overall, because it does encourage defense
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   and depth.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.320]   There's some things in here that could lead to adoption of software bills of materials.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.720]   There's a lot to like here.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   Biden is meeting with officials of Casea to talk about this.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:11.000]   Casea, and this is actually the most shocking thing, was told of the cybersecurity flaw in
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.640]   April and did nothing.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.520]   See, that should be illegal.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.000]   They need to be in out.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.400]   I mean, if you're a managed service provider, that is literally your job.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.960]   I already did that before.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.480]   They were told about this April 6 by the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:42.440]   They, Casea, had a climb to comment on the timeline, but I think that it's pretty clear
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:48.800]   that they were told about it and did they work on patching it.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:56.160]   Casea, they responded once they were notified and worked quickly to issue two patches, one
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.040]   in April and one in May, but they weren't enough.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.080]   Well, okay, then they tried.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.520]   Well, that's weird because they are literally a patch management.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   I know.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.720]   I'm like, if anyone, you're like, come on, man.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   Biden is going to meet with senior officials today to discuss this daily use of ransomware
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   attacks.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.760]   He brought it to Putin during their summit, during their non-summit summit, saying, you
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:36.920]   know, we got to work out a deal not to attack infrastructure.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.840]   It's unclear how much the Russian government has to do with these attacks, although many
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.200]   of them do come from criminal groups operating within their borders.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.560]   Republican National Committee yesterday disclosed that one of its contractors had been breached
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.960]   by hackers, but that no data was accessed.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.200]   Hackers affiliated with the SVR Russia's foreign intelligence service are believed to
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.920]   be responsible for that breach.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.880]   So it is getting bad out there.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.840]   I encourage if you're interested in this stuff to listen to our security now, Shokos, we deal
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.760]   with this a lot in great detail.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.920]   It's kind of, I mean, what we're getting to is the ability to destroy basic infrastructure
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.520]   without having to spend billions on the new warfare tanks.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:35.040]   I was reading, there was a fun article in a foreign policy this weekend about artificial
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.480]   intelligence on drones.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   So basically Turkey, I think, just killed some people without, by flying a drone, a weaponized
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:50.280]   drone that actually targeted people using AI as opposed to having a human in the loop.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.080]   So they took the human out of the loop for the first time.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.840]   That's a pretty significant step.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.120]   And that brings that kind of, I mean, the consumerization of technology brings that to
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.720]   like anybody.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.200]   But I don't know if there's like, a treaty is not going to help there because there's
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.720]   enough people who would pay for that.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.760]   I mean, it's kind of like arms dealers and how they live in this like gray area.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.240]   I don't know.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:24.440]   But how do you feel about Instagram saying we're no longer a photo sharing app?
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.640]   I'm okay with it, but there's quite a lot of people in the photography community that's
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.520]   a little bit concerned.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.360]   And I get it, but at the same time I get it where Instagram is coming from as well because
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   things are changing.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.000]   And you see the prowess that TikTok has.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.360]   I mean, it's got Mr. Jarvis hooked on it.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.200]   So it must be good, right?
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   Those musicals.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   It's the musicals.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   I deleted my TikTok.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   It's the sound track.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   It's me too.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.800]   That's why I deleted it because it's a time sink.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   It's seductive.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   But there's the same deal.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Adam Moserri, the CEO of Instagram posted an Instagram video.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.840]   He said how people connect with their close friends has changed a lot over the last five
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:13.560]   years or so and has moved primarily to messaging and away from feed and stories projects.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.720]   He says, I want to start by saying we're no longer a photo sharing app or a square photo
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.520]   sharing app.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.200]   They use Instagram people we find people use Instagram to be entertained.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.080]   That's the phrase right there.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.640]   So because let's be honest, there's some really serious competition out right now.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   TikTok is huge.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.400]   YouTube is even bigger and there's lots of other upstarts as well.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.960]   I think some of this goes back to the original founders of Instagram leaving when Apple Facebook
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.320]   bottom, Kevin's system and company stayed there for a while but left not so long ago.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.160]   Adam Moserri, who's a Facebook guy, was put in charge.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.080]   This clearly is Facebook's agenda now.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.960]   Instagram was started by photography lovers.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.080]   It was about sharing photos, but they're gone.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.640]   And now it's Facebook's agenda, right?
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.880]   And Facebook's agenda is TikTok's huge.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.120]   What are we going to do?
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   And things change.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   Things change.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   Things change.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.160]   But I don't know.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:16.080]   Yeah, but that doesn't mean that there's something wrong with having a photo sharing app that
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.840]   people love.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.320]   I don't think that there's anything wrong with Instagram.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.840]   I think Instagram is being changed because of Facebook's corporate need to attack a competitor,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.200]   not because its audience is demanding.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.840]   Oh, you can't know these photos.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   They're so boring.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.640]   I don't think the audience is demanding.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.120]   And I think that's what the audience is showing.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.320]   If you look at the average person, and apparently they've done it in their analytics.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.560]   Well, they say they're.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   Yeah, I don't buy it.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.400]   Just scroll through and scrolling through.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:50.680]   I can walk through and look at the users here in my home when they're on Instagram.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.200]   They are literally just flip, flip, flip, flip.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.600]   I hardly ever see them stop unless it's a video.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.800]   But why make Instagram into a TikTok clone?
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.240]   You know, that's what you got TikTok for.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   There don't you?
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.720]   Why should we stop printing our newspaper?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.080]   People like the newspaper.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.480]   They like the smell of it.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.920]   They like the feel of it.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   What's this?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   Internet thing?
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   I'm not saying that.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:21.680]   I'm saying that in that face, in my opinion, Facebook is modifying this for its own commercial
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   purposes.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.640]   They're worried about competition from TikTok, not because the users are demanding it.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.600]   They're saying there's hand waving saying, oh, the users are demanding it.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.560]   But I think that Instagram is a great photo sharing app.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.440]   Why turn it into TikTok?
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.920]   You can still share photos there.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   Now you can still...
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   That's the thing.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.320]   They didn't say they're not going to have photos available to be shared on their sorry
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.000]   about my voice.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.680]   You still can post your photos in four by five or square image if you want to.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:57.040]   But where Instagram is going to make its money is for people stopping and engaging on your
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.840]   video content, your motion content.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:04.640]   So there's an opportunity then for somebody to create a new Instagram, I would say.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.360]   Oh, that's what...
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.160]   That flicker was so successful.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.600]   We've heard through this before, Leo.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600]   We loved flicker.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.760]   Is it what flicker is for?
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.600]   And flicker wasn't a sustainable business.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.800]   I got screwed up to...
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   Because of Instagram, I think.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.400]   But now there's a flicker.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   Now there's a flicker.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   Instagram dominated...
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.520]   Instagram dominated the photo sharing space completely.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.040]   Twitter is starting to see a growth in the photography community.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.000]   You know how Twitter gives you those different hashtags and groups to follow and things like
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   that.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And I'm seeing more and more people and going there and engaging and basically saying,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   you know what?
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.160]   I like this better than my experience in Instagram because of the engagement here about my photos.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:52.400]   And it's not necessarily just people just thumbing through and saying, "Nice shot."
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.360]   There's more of an engagement for them.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:59.040]   I'm not seeing that yet, but I can't say I've put a lot of effort and photography on the
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.400]   Twitter side, but I'm just a small Instagram account.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:09.720]   Yeah, I mean, I don't really have a dog in this hunt either, so I don't really care.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.840]   But I think Instagram had a lot to be said for it.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:20.520]   And it's slowly over time, especially since the Facebook acquisition turned into really
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.240]   an advertising vehicle.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.680]   They've increased the number of ads now.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.520]   It used to be what every ninth image now seems to be every single one.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.400]   That's where they got bought because they've...
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   I think...
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   I think...
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   Newsmen off.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:40.880]   I think with Instagram, it all depends on what the user's goals are from a photographer's
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.080]   standpoint.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.600]   If your goals are to just show off your stuff for the family, then it may be fine.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   If your goals are to try to drive business, then yeah, you may want to rethink using
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:58.800]   Instagram to drive business and start to work the algorithm, if you will.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.520]   I look at my feed and I have a mix of photos and a mix of videos.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.560]   And sometimes those videos have nothing to do with photography.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   A lot of times, the videos are just stuff of my family.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.960]   It's usually something of the hard heads and their achievements.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:19.120]   But those things get a lot of engagement, even though my use of Instagram is all about being
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.040]   a digital content creator.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.720]   So I just put up a great...
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.280]   Casey Newton says, "Every US social network is tripping over itself to copy TikTok."
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.800]   And TikTok is just like linked in.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.640]   They just put up a new thing here.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   I put it on...
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   Resume.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.520]   Resume is on TikTok.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.880]   So Ben Thompson talks a little bit about this.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:47.760]   And he says, "TikTok has been tough for Facebook and Instagram to respond to for three reasons.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:53.920]   First, if Instagram has been defined by sharing moments, TikTok has been about manufacturing
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.320]   them with easy to use tools that commoditize creation."
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.880]   I'd agree 100% with that.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.640]   He says also, "TikTok has defined a new format which is something different than a scrollable
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:11.440]   feed or even tapable stories, both of which Instagram has, swipeable videos that are
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.080]   milled of both.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.200]   TikTok provides both an endless feed and a full screen immersive experience that's easily
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   navigable."
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   I'd agree.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.400]   They solved that one.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:26.360]   But I think the biggest one of all, he says, "TikTok isn't really a social network at all,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.880]   which freed the service to surface the most compelling content from anywhere in the world.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.440]   Most of the time you spent until you deleted it, Stacey, was probably not on the people
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.840]   you followed, but on the four-year page."
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   I never...
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.840]   Yeah, it was on the four-year page.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.840]   Just watching random stuff.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.160]   Yeah, random stuff, the algorithm picked for you.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   It's not...
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   In other words, it's not a social network.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.640]   It's an entertainment network.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.840]   And it does it really well.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:56.360]   I mean, it demonstrates that the YouTube model, which is you get everybody to make content
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   for you, then you use an algorithm to surface the most appealing content, the stickiest
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   content.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.160]   It took that and made it...
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.400]   I mean, you've really weaponized it with short clips.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.240]   Well, it added in the importance layer of collaboration, which is social.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   It's social.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.400]   I see less collaboration than I used to, though.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   Did you notice that?
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.880]   I think that's what you click on.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.720]   I see still lots of collaboration.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.880]   I mean, yes, it's probably less, but...
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   Far as TikTok?
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.160]   I've started to fade away.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.160]   I think people...
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.160]   I still see him.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.000]   Yeah, I mean, I see him, but not nearly as much.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   And maybe it is the algorithm and it's what I'm seeing.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.160]   It's hard to collaborate with naked women, Leo.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   I mean...
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   I try.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160]   I try.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.440]   If you want to collaborate, put my data on one channel.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.320]   Hey, honey, you want to collaborate?
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   Is that the news?
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   Is that the kids with the kids call it?
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   It's a collab.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   Collab.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   Collab.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.960]   So TikTok...
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.600]   The TikTok resume feature is bizarre.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.160]   It's designed to light candidates creatively and authentically showcase their skill sets
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.480]   and experiences.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   It's going to have...
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.960]   It's kind of brilliant in a way.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   I guess so.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.200]   I think it depends on the hiring person.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   Are you open-minded?
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   There's some things that you'll...
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   They're working with you all with this.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.200]   ...to the spotlight.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   ...to the spotlight.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   And Spotify.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.680]   And I bet they're working to hire a certain type of social media or engagement person,
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   too.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.320]   If you're looking for somebody under 25, you should be best placed to look.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   Where are they?
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.880]   They live in TikTok, right?
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   We should be...
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   As a journalist, this occurs to me.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:35.240]   As a journalism school, we should allow you to submit your essay on TikTok.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.800]   Here is TikTok's do's and don'ts of TikTok res.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   No, this is...
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.440]   Have clothes on.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.640]   Hi, I'd like to apply for a job.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.040]   Come on, play for me.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.800]   No, it's not playing.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.360]   Open the tournament.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   This is TikTokresumase.com.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.840]   And it's cool.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.240]   I can open it in the terminal.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.200]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.000]   Okay, let me refresh the page.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.400]   See if I can get it to do it.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.840]   You know, if I were a CIO...
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:04.840]   Hi, I'm Christian.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   I'm an entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.600]   It led me to creating my own major at Berkeley, specializing in human-centered design and
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   product development.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:16.320]   In 2018, I participated at the European Innovation Academy and alongside a global team of five.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.080]   We launched SmartCap, your Hydrogen System Smart Water Bottle.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.400]   So basically, they created the most boring TikToks in the world.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.440]   Yeah, I don't think they're actually going to be on TikTok.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   I think they're going to be in this special.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   This is when you send it to your...
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.960]   Yeah, but I kind of get this.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.800]   Hi, my name is Charmanda.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.040]   Here's a few reasons why you should hire me.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   I'll get to the...
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.040]   It's a generational thing about a team life.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.040]   Yes.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   I've been a TikTok creator since 2018.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.040]   In 2020, I became a TikTok college representative for Spelman College, where I attended a new
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.880]   band as an engineering major.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880]   I love to create art.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   That's kind of cool.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.720]   I mean, I kind of get this.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.080]   Here's the Doos and Dones.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.480]   Let's see if we can get this to work here.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   Doos and Dones.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   Hi, I'd like to apply for a job.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   Here's my resume crayon.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   Right?
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.080]   It's a talk instead.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   Sweet.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.320]   Let's power up your job search by crafting the perfect...
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.360]   Maybe we should do ad sales on TikTok.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.920]   Hi, my name is Leo.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.200]   I have a podcast network.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.600]   I'm looking for people who want to buy ads.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.960]   Maybe the eyeballs are there.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   Maybe I should do that.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.960]   If I were a CIO and I'm looking for a developer to type a person...
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   Right.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.920]   To build an in-house custom application for the company, I'm probably not going to look
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.320]   now at TikTok.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:40.600]   If I were a hiring representative at Adobe, that's looking for someone to help synergize
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.720]   the product and work with promotion and things like that, that makes sense.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.760]   You're looking for a young person with a certain kind of skill set.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.760]   Well, hold up though.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   Because this is...
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.120]   I'm just throwing this out there.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.600]   If you're one of those people who's focused on culture fit or you don't want to hire older
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.960]   people or you don't want to hire black people, this is going to be harder to avoid.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.680]   If you've got biases, you're going to be like, "Well, I don't want this person.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   They're ugly."
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.480]   So that is something I'm like, "Oh, I don't know."
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.880]   I mean, obviously we don't have blind hiring in the US today, so it doesn't matter.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.600]   But just throwing that out there is like...
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.360]   You know, but I can remember the days of doing resumes is I don't remember the last time
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:33.720]   I did a resume, but the story was to make your resume stand out from the rest of them
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   out there.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.920]   I tend to remember people having the taboo of using like canary yellow paper and stuff
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.240]   like that just because they wanted it to stand out.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.520]   And I guess this is just another iteration of that for people trying to get into the
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.520]   workforce.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.520]   I don't know.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.920]   It obviously generational to me.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Instead of...
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.160]   It's more like a cover letter, not a resume, right?
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.560]   So your resume is supposed to be...
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.560]   Okay.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   That makes more sense.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.320]   This is your chance to be like, "Hey, I'm Stacy and I love the Internet of Things.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.040]   Here's some crazy visuals about that and you should hire me because of this."
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   And then the resume will be like, "Oh, and I did all this boring stuff too."
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.760]   Do that one more time?
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   Okay.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:20.960]   I'll just try to trick you into a GIF or a GIF.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:27.920]   So you remember the police officer who played a Taylor Swift song when somebody was recording
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:33.400]   their interaction with him thinking that that would mean he couldn't put it on YouTube
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.840]   because it would get a takedown notice?
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   Remember that guy?
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.680]   Yeah, that'll just...
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:45.240]   The video now has 708,000 views.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:52.400]   And the anti-police terror project from all the publicity now has 1.1 million subscribers.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400]   Just growing.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.320]   So maybe that's not the best strategy.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.920]   Maybe he should have done...
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   What's that Canadian band?
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   Or Nickelback?
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.920]   That'd have done.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   That'd have done.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   Or Metallica.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.800]   Metallica would have taken him down.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.200]   Look, the deputy even says, "You can record all you want.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   I just know it won't be posted to YouTube because of their copy protection."
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   What's the protest?
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.840]   They didn't go overboard.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.640]   They just let it roll and let it roll.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.880]   It looks like they're bringing them coffee.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:37.080]   Well, if I remember ways due to someone having a scuffle with the police and I believe they
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.600]   lost their life and they had mental health issues and these people were out there to
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.680]   show support for the family and peacefully protest and they had a banner up.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.800]   And the police said, "You need to take that banner down."
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.520]   And it's just a mess.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.520]   A bunch of mess.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.600]   Well, don't play Taylor Swift music.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.840]   That's not going to help.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.440]   In fact, they might even get more views and more attention.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.280]   It will find it basically.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.200]   They call it the Streisand Effect.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.600]   Streisand Effect, exactly.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   Oh, right.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   Exactly.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   Whoops.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   Has Taylor had any response?
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.200]   Oh, I'm sure she loves it.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.760]   Well, Taylor doesn't talk a lot about those kinds of things.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.400]   She wades very judiciously.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:25.000]   Yeah, but when she does stand back, she got involved in Georgia and it made a big difference.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.480]   By the way, Mosil has done a little study about YouTube regrets.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:36.880]   They did a survey of 37,000 YouTube users.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.000]   That's funny and sad.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.560]   It's funny and sad.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:52.000]   The headline is that people who, the regretted seeing videos most likely watched those videos
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.880]   because of YouTube's recommendation engine.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   So, yeah.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:06.120]   I mean, that's one of the core conversations I have with my daughter, which is you can't
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.520]   unsee things.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.320]   So be very judicious on.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:15.240]   We talked about the algorithms and what they feed up so you can be kind of aware.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.240]   So this was an interesting.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.600]   They made an extension.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:22.640]   They Mozilla regrets reporter browser extension for Firefox and Chrome.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:30.080]   That's how they got so many reports between July 2020 and May 2021.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:35.560]   And I guess when you saw a video you regretted seeing, you were supposed to click it and
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:41.520]   they say why most of the videos people regret watching come from recommendations.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.720]   YouTube recommends videos that violate their own policies.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.320]   Modern English speakers are hit the hardest.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.520]   And of course, YouTube regrets can alter people's lives forever.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   They say, and I kind of agree with this.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:01.560]   Urgent action must be taken to reign in YouTube's algorithm.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.800]   It's their secret sauce, but I think they could maybe do a better job.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   Always true.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   But we also did.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.880]   And then the other end in that spectrum, you have a YouTube user such as myself that
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.760]   loves the way it serves up content for me.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.800]   So you would you have the autoplay turned on and you'll just let it go?
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   Most of the time.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   Interesting.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.560]   And I even watch it downstairs on the TV, you know, because it's I get a lot of good
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.560]   content.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   I do.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.320]   You know, I do notice that that is one of the big ways young people watch YouTube is
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.480]   they'll put it on the TV and let it roll.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:42.120]   And then I also do likes and dislikes on certain videos that don't necessarily hit the mark
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   for me.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.800]   But most of the time the content that served up to me is pretty topical or pretty funny
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   or to just have no YouTube regrets.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   None.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   Not yet anyway.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.680]   Oh, and not yet anyway.
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   It's coming for you.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.640]   How about you, Stacy?
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.880]   Any YouTube regrets?
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.560]   How about for your daughter?
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.960]   I don't have autoplay turned on.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.000]   Yeah, we don't have a we don't have autoplay turned on for that reason.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.320]   And I think some things that I have seen the best minds of my generation go down the tubes.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.840]   Oh, no, I do.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.680]   There's so many memes that are out there that I've never even heard of.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   And when I do see him, I'm like late to the party.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.600]   And I think that's just algorithmic, you know, because I don't they know, they know
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.000]   that you're stuff out.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.800]   You know, I haven't watched YouTube recommend.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.280]   I haven't haven't done that.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.440]   Let it play through en ages.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.280]   I almost always go to us.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.360]   Like I just did, I was looking for a specific video.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   Mm hmm.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.760]   I very rarely will just turn on YouTube and let it play through.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   I should try that.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.360]   But maybe that's just we're busy.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.360]   Is that what it is?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Like at the time?
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   I just watch TV.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.040]   See, so that's the difference.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.920]   It's not that I'm busy, I think, Stacy, for me because I watch TV.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Right.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.720]   That's where young people watch TV.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.040]   They don't watch Netflix or Amazon Prime.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.280]   They're watching YouTube.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.760]   At least I see my my my 18 year old and my 26 year old.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.040]   That's how they that's what they do.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.800]   They just and I bet you that's true.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   Your hard heads.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.760]   They just turn on YouTube.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.840]   They turn on turn on YouTube and every now and then they'll go to one of those subscription
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.400]   services because there's a particular series that they want to watch.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.320]   But most of the time it's just YouTube content.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   I just reloaded my YouTube page right now and the first things that pop up.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.400]   It's a Photoshop tutorial in KBHD.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.640]   They know you so well.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.240]   One to Sykes comedy because I watch a lot of stand up comedians.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.080]   And here's a hands off photography video.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.440]   Here's Alex Lindsey.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.320]   Here's a Clemson replay.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.320]   It gets me.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.320]   All right.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.040]   That's a good exercise.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.080]   Let me look at what YouTube recommends for me.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:10.800]   Quit the Sudoku for people who don't like Sudoku Mac break weekly boy.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.360]   You are boring in another Sudoku video.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360]   Oh, geez.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   A woodcock.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   What are you?
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   Sudoku video.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360]   Hold it.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360]   Hold it.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.320]   How do you possibly make a video out of Sudoku?
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.480]   Well, jazz, it's fascinating.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.560]   Actually this channel, I thought people watching making play video games was boring.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.560]   This channel.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.160]   It's called cracking the crick that has up to nine.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.760]   I'm raining Sudoku champ.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.640]   And he makes Sudoku's.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.120]   It's just fascinating.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.600]   Wednesday, so I couldn't remember what it's really, really good.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   I like it.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.160]   Oh, Leo, you don't have any YouTube.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   Oh, no.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.480]   I don't have a life, but that's still pretty fun.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   That's still pretty fun.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.080]   Here's for some reason a Nintendo switch game Zelda Skyward Sword HD.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.760]   Chess, office hours, Renee Richie's Apple ecosystem.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.040]   How Amy Webb beat her insomnia.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.480]   Oh, here's some more Sudoku.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   How does set of classics Sudoku?
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   Wow.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   That's so tight.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.440]   Oh, look, there's a lot of Sudoku yesterday.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.080]   It's a much tic-tac-toe video on YouTube.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.680]   Sometimes somebody is really going to win in a surprising way.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.080]   You know none of this is objectionable, actually.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.720]   I think YouTube has done an excellent job.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   It's just really boring.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.640]   No, it's because we're watching those stay.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   Oh, it's all right.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.080]   If I watch one, go away.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.360]   Let's watch Sudoku video and see what it recommends next.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360]   No, no.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.320]   It's a long, they're long videos, as you might imagine.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   Well, no, you'll see on the right hand.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.640]   Here, let's see the calculus.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.040]   This is only 49 minutes, pretty quick.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.040]   The calculus is a go-to-go.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   I think you're right.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.960]   So, I think your page will have what's next.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   Where would I see that over here?
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   Yeah, it's usually boring.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   I don't know.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   Why don't you see that?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   I always see that.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.760]   Maybe it's too big.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.160]   If I make a little smaller, I'll see more.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.400]   Oh, I mean, am I in theater mode?
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   Theater mode, yeah.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.400]   How do I get out of theater mode?
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400]   I've heard about it.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.720]   Watch a video to tell you how to do the video.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.080]   I need a video on how to get out of theater mode.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.320]   I'm covered to the bottom right of the video.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.160]   The button at the bottom of the video.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   There you go.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.760]   Man, my mini player theater mode, full screen.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.760]   That's theater mode.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   Wow.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.880]   I don't get any recommendations.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.200]   Because I'm happy watching this video.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.600]   They know.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600]   About Sudoku.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   You're a model good eye.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   Actually, this is...
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.920]   I'm not kidding.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.080]   This is my recommendation for the week.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.360]   The cracking the cryptic channel.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   And I'm not alone.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360]   372,000 people agree.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.440]   That's awesome.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.880]   It's the best place for Sudoku videos.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   Oh, geez.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.680]   It's very soothing.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.960]   If you didn't want to be alone in your house, you could have a thing in the background.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.720]   I don't think we're getting Sudoku shaming here.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.960]   I want to audit your suitcase to Hawaii.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.160]   How about your Sudoku?
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.160]   I don't need a book.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:34.400]   I've got the Cracking the Cryptic app, which has some excellent Sudoku.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.120]   I wrote a Sudoku solving program.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   Oh, boy.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.920]   Tell us more.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.720]   What is your local DU?
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.080]   What scripting language did you use to?
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.800]   I wrote it in racket.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800]   It's not a scripting language.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   But it's not.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.880]   It's not crazy that I was to go through Shabib.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.520]   Oh, there's nothing wrong.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.000]   Sudoku is mathematics.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   It's good.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   It's good for your brain.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   It's good for you.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Cool.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Yeah, it's like...
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   I'm just not good at it.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   No, it's fun.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Ah, it's fun.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.440]   Yeah, you like mocking me.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   I know.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.160]   Oh, you don't like mocking me.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.520]   I don't mock you.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.040]   I tell the truth about you.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.200]   Because I don't watch YouTube that much, it has very little to go on.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   So I'm still...
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.960]   What is it recommending for you?
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.280]   I'm getting all of the navel videos, which I like back in the day.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   The two dogs.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.440]   It's funny, but I haven't watched any of them.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.480]   Oh, I get those two, Jeff.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480]   I get Twit.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   I get...
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   This is funny.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   I don't watch this.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480]   I should watch this.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   Dual lingo for talking to children.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   SNL.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.040]   Oh, that's gonna sound yeah.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040]   I get Puple-Mousse.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040]   We both like Puple-Mousse.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   I get Chrome Unboxed.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.400]   Showing me every new Chrome book.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   It's
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:12.160]   Discord. Marques Brownlee's iPad OS 15 review. We've got something from Twit.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.740]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:19.340]   Dume Eternal, the hanging gardens of Babellani is watching a documentary. What's the deal
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:25.680]   with Avengers campus from offhand Disney? Amazing abandoned home with infinity pool.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.020]   Just some music and Fast and Furious 9. Let me explain.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:34.960]   So that actually was shot by Kitten occupying his bed that's on my list. That's a nice
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   thing.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.300]   I have a lot of husky content.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.300]   A husky content.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.760]   Dramatic huskies argue anything.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.640]   I don't know why you don't see what's next on here. So the next thing I have is compilation
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.440]   with dogs that have done wrong. Guilty dogs.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.880]   Maybe if I maybe I have auto play turned off or something.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.120]   Then I have Martin Short and personates Betty Davis.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.760]   See, this is what it sounds like.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.560]   YouTube, we talk a lot about the crap on YouTube and the radicalizations of, but everything
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.840]   we've seen here is really great. I mean, it's great.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.200]   It's stuff that you wouldn't see on any other medium.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.600]   And that's my argument is I think the algorithm is going to work for you as long as you continue
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.480]   to feed it. If you're scrolling through and you happen to just pause on that dogfight
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.840]   on the screen is probably going to give you more dogfights.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.600]   Just like the memes and stuff like that.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.000]   There are people that look for that type of way.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.920]   I was in the wrong.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.520]   I was in subscriptions.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.960]   I'm going to go to explore.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.280]   So those are all those are all things I've subscribed to.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   Just hit the homepage.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.760]   That's how I did.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.000]   That's how boring he is.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   He subscribed.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   He's reminded me.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   He's subscribed.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   He's not.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.240]   But when I hit the homepage, it goes to my subscriptions.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.520]   But if I go to explore, these are recommendations, right?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.840]   Here's Ikea Hacks.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.400]   A lot of home decor stuff.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.880]   I don't. Oh, here's city girls.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.600]   The Torculator official video.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.400]   Ariana Grande Nintendo switch.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.120]   The world's fastest Big Mac ever eaten.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120]   I got to watch that.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.920]   Oh, no, those are all trending because I have.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   I have those are trending.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.360]   Oh, those aren't your home.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.280]   Your home was the one you were on.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.200]   That's just my subscriptions though.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.280]   I mean, so hit the premium button at the top.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   That's what I click on.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.320]   And I get my subscription.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.080]   Oh, and it takes me straight to subscription.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080]   It's interesting.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080]   Huh?
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.600]   Well, maybe I don't have.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.600]   No, I have subscriptions.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.200]   It must be a setting.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.120]   My dog has everything I watch.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.920]   Yeah, I don't have any of that stuff.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   So I'm.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920]   I pay.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.640]   It's Linux.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   It's Linux.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.160]   Oh, you know, it might be that, you know what?
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.360]   It might be because I got Firefox blocking.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.840]   Yeah, maybe Firefox is blocking something YouTube needs.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.160]   Oh, I wish you see the problem here is that I think that YouTube is spying on me.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.680]   Because now I have hilarious dramatic Husky throws a temper tantrum in my feet.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.040]   Oh, no, you should have that because it's part of the Golden Retriever dog thing.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.960]   Oh, I mean, all right, I was afraid they were.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   Oh, yeah, that's I actually.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   Somebody in mountains.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.240]   He was quickly typing in at Husky.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.240]   He likes Huskies.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.880]   I just had to explain that to somebody not not just yesterday, actually.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.080]   It was it was my favorite.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.920]   Here's my favorite recommendation from Instagram.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:44.080]   Mark Zuckerberg riding a foil board to the music of John Denver waving the American flag.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.640]   I'm going to turn John Denver on and say it don't get.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.760]   Yeah, because yeah.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.000]   So doesn't he have a person tell why?
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.840]   He has people who have to tell him that this is Stacy at least he didn't have sunscreen
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.240]   on this time.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   And you know, it's sad.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.880]   You know, it's really sad.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:13.000]   The very first message I see on here is I know for a fact you saw my DM, Mr. Zuckerberg.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.640]   It's disrespectful to ignore people's messages.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.160]   I'm also like 78.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.520]   So respect your elders, mate.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.600]   Zuckerberg does not want your direct message.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:29.800]   I promise you that's like some people are confused in the world about this.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.560]   But maybe they're confused because they see Mark Zuckerberg floating in the upper board.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.240]   I want to see the other side and see how big the film grew was to capture this.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   Right.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   That's funny.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   That's what Alex Lindsey said.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:45.520]   He said, I know what it's like if you're a CEO of a major corporation.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.440]   None of this is unplanned.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   All of this.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   That's why I don't get this.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Why did they?
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Who were they talking to?
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.680]   Who thought this was a good idea?
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:03.240]   Well, no, I just said America like writing a hover foil and some lake with the American
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.040]   like crafting where he's putting like all of this.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.840]   I'm just like, who is the intended audience for this thing?
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.360]   Because it's definitely not me.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.280]   And it's definitely not like kids my daughter's age.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   Nope.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   It's not for teenagers.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.280]   Who is it for?
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:27.000]   It's for those kids who bullied him in middle school and say, look at me.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.200]   I can ride this one.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.760]   There was a story out today that Bezos in an earlier office building used to insist on
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.720]   running up 14 flights of stairs.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.760]   It's all these nerds and wimps who are proving themselves.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.880]   I did like that.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.040]   I mean, look how ripped he is as a result.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   Yeah, yes.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.720]   See, it works.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.840]   I do.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.320]   I think this is interesting.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.600]   Norway has passed a law that requires influencers to label their photos on Instagram if they've
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.520]   been retouched because interesting.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.920]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.200]   Not because they have some devotion to the integrity of the photo, but because they're
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:15.040]   concerned that people are judging themselves based on the body types of people they see
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040]   on Instagram.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.120]   They require the same thing out of Vogue magazine and People magazine.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.320]   Every photo is retouched.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.400]   No, it's a lot of those magazines actually have gone into voluntary standards.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.160]   Saying that's good.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:34.160]   Advertisements where a body's shape, size, or skin has been retouched even through a filter
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.080]   before photos taken will need a standardized label designed by the Norwegian Ministry of
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.960]   Children and Family Affairs.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.800]   Now, they're saying advertisements.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.200]   But I guess if you're an influencer, anything you post is kind of an ad, is that it?
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   So I'm a teenager.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.480]   I have a zit on my nose.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   And why not?
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.040]   Let me get rid of the zit on my nose.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   Okay, hold on.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.480]   They want you to say it because a lot of these people, a lot of the people we've grown, we
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.680]   now understand that magazines alter images too.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.880]   We've had so many conversations about that.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.560]   A lot of influencers, they're selling their authenticity.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.840]   So if you think about them selling that this is their actual life, it's the same reason
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.400]   why the FTC made them put like sponsored on it.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400]   Sponsored content.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.880]   But again, they really liked this stuff.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:33.000]   The Norwegian word is cop's press, which is literally body pressure.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.280]   The proposal is if you post and get paid for that post on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat,
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:47.640]   TikTok and Twitter, and your photo has enlarged lips, narrowed wastes, exaggerated muscles,
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.960]   then you need to label it.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.440]   So the stars get to do this and the real people don't.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.640]   I remember when my partner at the launches of EW and Conde Nett and I'm curious, the brilliant
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.920]   Joan Feeney, sat me down one day and said, Jeff, why is there a fragrance?
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   I don't know.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.920]   It's because somebody paid for that.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920]   It's an ad.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   Right.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.920]   It's an ad.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:19.680]   And, you know, we look at how things are manipulated in all ways, visually and otherwise,
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.120]   in media.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.920]   And so, but we leave them alone, but now the real people get a chance to maybe live a
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920]   little bit differently.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.640]   Maybe it's maybe photo touching is my version of cosplay or something.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.960]   I get the points about saying love yourself as yourself, but it's also about imagining
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.040]   yourself differently.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   And now this has all been made to be something that's bad for you long.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.400]   You just have to leave it alone.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.760]   You just have to label it.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.960]   By the way, according to the new region daily newspaper, the regulation has been positively
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.400]   received by a number of influencers in Norway's.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.240]   One even arguing that it should apply to all retouched photos.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.880]   I mean, I think that's the direction I would go is make everyone be labeled.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.080]   Meanwhile, how pink am I my video today is better.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   Yeah, it is.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.640]   I use my app to change it.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   Yeah, I see.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.560]   We're going to have to put a label on there.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.080]   Can you get that going, John?
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.760]   Just, you know, photo retouched.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.200]   Jeff is normally a brighter shade of pink.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   Thank you.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.760]   You mixed effect.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.680]   Our show today brought to you quite literally by cash fly.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.400]   We're CDN, our content delivery network.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.720]   We've been using them for more than 10 years.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.800]   I remember it was really a struggle in the early days of the podcast to get these shows
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.760]   to people downloading from a web page.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.960]   Just was inconsistent.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.920]   We tried BitTorrent for a while, Matt Levine, the founder of cash fly call me.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.400]   He said, "Leo, let me help."
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   And he did.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   And thank you.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   We love cash fly.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   They're now offering something new.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400]   This is really cool.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   Ultra low latency streaming.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.760]   We're not talking web RTC.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.200]   Now, this is something much better.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.520]   Stream delays, less than one second.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.520]   There are lots of perks.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.520]   You can play anywhere.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.720]   They have a great HTML5 player, which has an SDK so you could put it on mobile, wherever
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.760]   you need the player to run websites, applications, any platform.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.840]   And of course, because cash fly is over 50 points of presence all over the world.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:21.480]   They're real global CDN, the fastest CDN for throughput globally.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.080]   More video streams will be streaming quickly.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.880]   Anywhere you have viewers doesn't matter where they are, what continent they're on,
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.000]   on this amazing low latency network.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.600]   And it scales, man, does it scale?
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.040]   More than a million users concurrently.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:40.160]   You can ingest thousands of synchronous streams, transmux them simultaneously with live failover.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:47.200]   They can ingest RTMP, RTMPS, SRT, and more to deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.960]   streams and they can do it all simultaneously at the same time.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.440]   Unless they could tailor a solution to meet your unique needs.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.840]   If you're looking to stream as many as a million concurrent streams today, you need
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.480]   to check out cash fly.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:07.680]   And of course, I can vouch for their excellent priority support 24/7, 365 days a year.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   They're always there when you need them.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.520]   And because of their reliable throughput and scalability, they're up to five times faster
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:21.880]   than other CDNs and the most reliable CDN in the world backed by a 100% SLA.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.240]   I can vouch for that too.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.840]   We've never had a problem with cash fly in all these years.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.680]   They're great people, great corporate citizens.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.960]   They've raised $50,000 for world central kitchen.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:38.840]   They were the first to pioneer any cash CDN infrastructure way back when in 2002.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.400]   Their best hop technology automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.200]   across their global network of pops for maximum performance and reliability.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200]   We're talking cash fly.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.240]   Want to know more?

[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Thank you.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   Cash fly for all these years.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.360]   Facebook is also testing.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.600]   This is just a test.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:30.520]   A prompt that asks you if you're worried about your friends becoming an extremist.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.360]   Are you concerned that someone you know is becoming an extremist?
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.520]   We care, panic.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.840]   We keep going care about preventing extremism on Facebook.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.520]   Others in your situation have received confidential support.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.080]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.360]   Others have received confidential support.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   What does that mean?
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.080]   Because, okay, I'll tell you why.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   I'll give you an example.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.120]   We have a family of friends.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.280]   Very nice people.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   She's a teacher.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   Her husband has recently fallen down the QAnon hole.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.480]   Terribly, so incredibly that it's become a massive problem.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.280]   If she were to see this, it would be support for her, right?
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280]   But it is also that there's help you can get.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]   Help you can get.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.840]   But it would also, well, people can offer help to others.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:27.000]   The alert also redirects the user to a support page that says, another alert says, "violent
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.400]   groups try to manipulate your anger and disappointment.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.560]   You can take action now to protect yourself and others."
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.600]   Also going to a support page.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.640]   The company's directing users to a variety of resources, including life after hate and advocacy
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.400]   group that helps people leave violent, far-right movements.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.920]   I don't think it's a bad idea.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:59.320]   I wonder how they know that, is everybody going to see this or do they know somehow that
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.400]   you're being exposed to extremist content or somebody you know is?
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.000]   Define extremist and do they do a good job of it?
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.760]   A, B, what's the data?
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.240]   I'm modified, yes.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   Modified but better, always better.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240]   That's a visual cue.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.880]   Oh, that's good.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.880]   Thank you, John.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.360]   It's a little bug that says modified.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:25.920]   I think it maybe should be more clear like, "Mr. Jarvis's photo has been modified to improve
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   his appearance."
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920]   How about that?
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.920]   And it didn't work.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.920]   It did work.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.920]   That's good.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.480]   And it keeps trying and John never gives him the right settings for the app.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.480]   So I can look like a human being.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.480]   You look like a woman.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   What a do.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   You're a little underexposed, right?
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   Give him some tips here, Aunt Pruitt.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   You're the photographer.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   Yeah, he is just a touch underexposed.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.560]   He needs more feel like it.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.720]   Yeah, that's the problem because his face is blown out, but the rest of the room is dark.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.640]   So we need to really, maybe it's all that white around his face.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   Oh, that's perfect.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640]   That's better.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   There you go.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.640]   Leave it there.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   I want to read that.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   The sun changes.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   Sorry, it's crazy.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   That is the problem.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   The sun is moving.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   The sun is changing.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   You heard it here first.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.640]   The sun is changing.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:12.280]   The sun is standing exactly the same spot.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280]   We're moving.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.280]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280]   That's true.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   Now I have no way.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   Galileo.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   Galileo.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   Galileo.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   Galileo.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.280]   Yeah, moving right along.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.920]   We're, I'm sorry.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.440]   You were actually doing a real story until I went off.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.440]   I forgot.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.200]   Did I mention Wally Funk?
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.960]   No, I don't think so.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.360]   I think I would have remembered.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.800]   He's got the funk.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.280]   We got the funk.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:48.280]   She is going with Jeff Bezos and his brother into space along aboard the new shepherd rocket.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.440]   July 20th.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.400]   She will be the oldest person ever to reach space.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.880]   Wally Funk.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.360]   Actually an interesting story about Wally Funk.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.880]   She was chosen to be a member of the Mercury 13.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:08.160]   Remember the Mercury project was the project, the first orbital project and the Mercury
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.480]   astronauts were chosen to go into space.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:19.440]   There were 13 women in that program who were denied because at the time NASA's requirement
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.720]   was that you'd be a fighter pilot and there were no female fighter pilots.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.520]   So she was an easy excuse to get rid of the women.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.600]   So she was trained.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.360]   She was ready, but we're never allowed to go into space.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.360]   This is a cool story.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.840]   She became a FAA inspector of well-known pilot.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:42.920]   Here's the video of Wally Funk, 82 years old with Jeff Bezos.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:50.480]   You come back down, we land gently on the desert surface.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.400]   We open the hatch and you step outside.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.160]   What's the first thing you say?
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.520]   I was saying, honey, that was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.840]   And she gives me a big hug.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.920]   I've been flying forever and I have 19,600 flying hours.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   Cool, man.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.120]   I have taught over 3,000 people to fly.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.800]   Private commercial instrument, flight engineer, airline transport, gliding, everything that
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.960]   the FAA has I've got the license for.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.120]   And I can outrun you.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.840]   A 14 stairs, lights and stairs, let's just say.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.880]   The same program, they asked me, do you want to be a astronaut?
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   I said, yes.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:39.400]   They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.320]   So I got a hold of NASA four times.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.960]   I said, I want to become an astronaut, but nobody would take me.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.240]   I didn't think that I would ever get to go up.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.640]   Things remarkably rage free in this particular.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.360]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.520]   I said, guess what?
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.120]   It doesn't matter what you are.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.040]   You can still do it if you want to do it.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.680]   And I like to do things that nobody has ever done.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.800]   We're going to fly you up into space on the very first flight.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   That's your--
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   I can't--
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.600]   I want to hang out with her.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   So NASA wouldn't do it.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.600]   I'm fabulous, I feel it.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.600]   But Amazon would.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600]   Jeff Bezos would.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   I'd like to find the origin to go on this trip.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.600]   You're going to be an astronaut.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.600]   Oh, finally.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600]   Is that awesome?
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.600]   I'll love it every second of it.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.600]   I want to take her to the gym with you.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.600]   Ah, get out of here.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   She cannot run you, man.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600]   Yeah, that was what I'm saying.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   I want to take her to the gym.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.600]   She'd get me fired.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.600]   Isn't that great?
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.600]   Isn't that great?
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]   I love that.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   And then there's--
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   And then there's, I've said to say, Virgin Atlantic's CEO, who
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600]   has decided--
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.600]   Richard Branson.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   --Briston.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.560]   Richard Branson has decided that Jeff Bezos will not be the first billionaire in space.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   And he's going to go up a few days before--
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   He is like a week before.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.560]   --a week earlier.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   This is a fairly offensive race, no?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560]   It's a little offensive.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   The flight of the billionaires.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   Space yachts.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   But you know, I was mocking this a little bit.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.560]   But now that I saw that Wally Funk story, I thought, yeah, that's pretty good, Jeff.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560]   Good job.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   That's awesome.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.560]   Whoever arranged that, Mark Zuckerberg hired that person.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560]   Yeah, that's good PR.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   That's great to do this.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.560]   Those-- yeah.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.560]   Because no one's going, yeah, Jeff Bezos, this is a great idea that you're going to spend lots
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.560]   of money to go into space.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560]   There's--
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560]   Right.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560]   --you know.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560]   But I'll be carrying a flag.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.560]   And in that case, I'm kind of happy that Mark Zuckerberg just did it on a hoverboard and
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560]   not in the rocket ship.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.560]   Let's play the drums because it's time for the Google change lock.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.560]   The Google--
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.560]   The Google change--
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   We should--
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.560]   We should have anything in it?
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   No.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560]   Fairly anything in it.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560]   It's just very light.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.560]   The Google box is empty.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.560]   There is a new Google Drive for desktop app.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.560]   Google Photos Upload multi-account too, which is kind of cool.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   It's rolling out now.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.560]   There you go.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.560]   The new Google Drive for desktop.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.560]   Google keeps changing.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.560]   Remember, they-- it was Google-- I think it was originally Google Drive and then it became
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.560]   back up in sync.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.560]   Now it's back to Google Drive.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.560]   And they are adding--
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.560]   The other thing mine still says back up in sync.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   So now it'll be a Google Drive for desktop automatic photos upload as well.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   Yeah, Google.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.560]   Good goin'.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.560]   You go, girl.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.560]   Google Fuchsia has a new logo.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.560]   Why does it didn't rename it?
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]   It's a--
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   I think Fuchsia's a good name.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.560]   Lots of things they have are good names.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.560]   They got a great color.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.560]   So this is the--
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.560]   Fuchsia's Hot Pink.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.560]   That's an amazing color.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   This is the old logo.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560]   Isn't it Hot Pink?
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.560]   The new logo is black and it's a Mobius strip.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.560]   So I don't know.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.560]   Of course.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.560]   Is it a Mobius strip?
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   Well, that's just stupid.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   Well, thank you.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   Thank you.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]   Your logo's a color.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.560]   You need to be the color.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.560]   And thank you for joining the team.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   Well, maybe that's just the black and white version.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.560]   Google App--
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.560]   That's a charitable Stacy.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.560]   Google App Beta loses built-in browser and returns to Chrome custom tabs for now.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.560]   Don't know what that means.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   So Google keeps returning to things they used to have.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560]   Can we get back reader then?
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.560]   Well, when you do the search, it opens up in its own little--
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560]   Ah.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.560]   Browser.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   Right.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   It's not very functional.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   So--
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560]   So I like this idea of going back.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.560]   Going back.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   Go back to the old ways.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:52.560]   Google Meet, finally, that app that you use for all your serious business meetings has added filters and fun masks.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.560]   So you too can be stuck like a cat in your next court hearing.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.560]   Whoo!
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.560]   Not a cat.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.560]   Be a cat.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.560]   Let's see.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.560]   Stiles.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560]   Let's create a meeting.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560]   Start an instant meeting.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.560]   Allow.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.560]   Allow.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.560]   Everybody can join the meeting.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   There it is.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.560]   Allow.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.560]   Allow.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.560]   Allow.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560]   Okay.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   There's that.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.560]   Now where's my fun stuff?
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.560]   Where's my fun things?
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.560]   I don't see anything.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.560]   Nothing.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.560]   Nothing.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.560]   Well, maybe it has a roll back here.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560]   It's a forthcoming change.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   Sounds so cranky.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560]   Nothing.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560]   I got nothing.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   I got a picture of the ceiling.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560]   That's it.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560]   All right.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   Before somebody gets in there and moons us.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   Thank you.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.560]   Thank you.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.560]   I've closed the meeting.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   It's over.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.560]   The July security patches rolling out to Google Pixel.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560]   Get it?
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.560]   All that's big news.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   It happens every month.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.560]   That's the Google change.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.560]   It couldn't.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.560]   So sad.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.560]   So disappointed.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560]   Okay.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.560]   It's a Google this week.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.560]   It really, you know, they took the week off.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   Did you?
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.560]   I mean, a lot of, yeah.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   I just, I don't, you know what?
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.560]   I'm done here.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   It's like, okay.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   He can't wait for vacation.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560]   I'm going on vacation.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.560]   He's like, man, I got a vacation.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560]   I'm not here.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.560]   I could talk about meat grown in Israeli bio reactors.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.560]   I could talk about being a rotten name to have these days.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560]   Well, that's, you know, that is true.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.560]   That is true.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   The problem with that story, I was going to talk about it on, to, I realized I couldn't talk about without saying the name over and over again.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.560]   Madam A.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.560]   Should Amazon rename Madam A?
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   The problem, a new report from BBC, details how the parents of children named Madam A.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.560]   See, there's the problem.
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.560]   There's the problem.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   Our challenging Amazon to change, remove Madam A as a wake word for its devices.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.560]   Children called Madam A are, and they should be, reportedly being bullied for sharing a name with the voices.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:37.560]   And with the voice assistant, some, with other children, in some cases, teachers, issuing them commands like they were the smart assistant.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.560]   That's so mean.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.560]   Set a timer.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.560]   I told you to set a timer.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:54.560]   A spokesperson with Amazon has reached out to TechRadar, which posited, perhaps this is time to change the name, with this statement saying,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:04.560]   "We designed our voice assistant to reflect qualities we believe, we value in people, being smart, considerate, empathetic and inclusive.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.560]   We're saddened by the experiences you've shared and want to be very clear."
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.560]   The only reason is to do co-voice for an Amazon spokesperson.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.560]   I don't think that's true.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.560]   I don't think so.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560]   We have better things to do.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.560]   We're saddened by the experiences you've shared and want to be very clear.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.560]   Bullying of any kind is unacceptable, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   We're not going to do a darn thing about it.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.560]   As an alternative to Madam A, you can use computer.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:45.560]   We also offer several other wake words customers can choose from, including Echo, Computer and Amazon.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.560]   You know what?
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.560]   I name my kid computer.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.560]   I don't like that.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:58.560]   We value feedback from customers, and as with everything we do, we will continue to look for ways to offer them more choice in this area.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.560]   Yeah, the issue isn't that.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.560]   What are you going to do?
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.560]   What are you going to do?
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560]   The kids are just going to have to...
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.560]   Cuts are...
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.560]   Truck it up.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:12.560]   You know, though, I have to respect Apple chose from the 78-year-old to Zuckerberg.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.560]   Same thing.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.560]   But you know what?
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.560]   Siri isn't a person's name.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.560]   Hey, Google isn't a person's name.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.560]   It's only Amazon that has this problem, right?
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.560]   Are there kids named Siri?
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560]   There are...
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   Siri may be.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560]   Well, yes.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.560]   There's a famous one.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.560]   Tom Cruise's daughter, isn't he?
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.560]   He named his daughter Siri.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.560]   Oh, before...
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.560]   That was before these things.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   I mean, oh, Tom was mad.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.560]   There was an iPhone.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   Understandably, Tom's a little angry.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.560]   I mean, but...
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.560]   But Amazon offers some things.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.560]   What are you going to do?
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.560]   Well, I don't think we should...
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.560]   I think going forward, let's not give people's names to voice assistants.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.560]   It's the same thing.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.560]   You don't name a dog Fred or Barney and name him Rags or...
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.560]   You know...
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.560]   Our dog is named Sophie.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560]   Our dog is named Alicia.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560]   Or Cap.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.560]   You got a problem with that?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.560]   Huh?
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560]   Let's talk about it, huh?
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560]   Oh, but then there's Biscuit.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.560]   Biscuit, perfect name for a dog.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.560]   That's what a dog...
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.560]   Dog name should not be human names.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.560]   You don't want to be going to the park.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.560]   You're going, "Hey, hey, Alicia."
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.560]   And some person comes over.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.560]   That's no good.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.560]   But it also looks a little bit weird if I go outside and start yelling, "Hey, Biscuit, come here."
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.560]   No, that's normal.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.560]   You know it's a dog immediately.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560]   You know it's a dog.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   Rover, you know it's a dog.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.560]   Are we upset that Amazon is using bots to fire people?
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.560]   I'm not upset.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.560]   I think it's...
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.560]   No, I was just going to say...
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:57.560]   It just feels like the extension of the worst, like most immutable employment policies.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.560]   And you see this across low wage jobs.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560]   You know, it's...
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560]   Maybe it's not a bot.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560]   Maybe it's just like a set of rules.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   And if you deviate them even for like humane or normal reasons, you're still fired.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.560]   This is in the same category as saying it shouldn't be a person's name kind of.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   I mean, the guy is fired by email.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.560]   That's bad.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   But he's a contract driver.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560]   He got an automated email.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.560]   The algorithms tracking him had decided he wasn't doing his job properly.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.560]   The 63-year-old army veteran was stunned.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.560]   He'd been fired by a machine.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.560]   But workforce management is common practice in enterprise.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:38.280]   There's always some type of reports being run all day every day to figure out who's doing
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.840]   what, why they're doing it, how long is it taking them to do it, especially if it's like
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.560]   in the service industry.
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.560]   I don't know.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.560]   It is what it is.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   Is it any better to have some guy come down from the home office to say, "I'm sorry,
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   we're letting you go."
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   It's bad enough.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.560]   It says you're a human being.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.560]   Okay.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.560]   I'm with you.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.560]   At least appreciate enough of you.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   The same reason you don't break up with your fiance via text.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.560]   Right.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.560]   Right.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.560]   He's now turned this to local person and drew a mean person who fires people and breaks
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.560]   up.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.560]   I don't have that many voices.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.560]   Jeff, I have to read.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:21.440]   But also the algorithm still has to make sure it's within decent range and not just randomly
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.040]   fire in someone because they missed a delivery.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.200]   Miss two deliveries this day in the middle of a hurricane or something like that.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.840]   You say that the automated system is insufficiently attuned to real world challenges drivers face
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.840]   every day.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:36.840]   It's just metrics, right?
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.760]   I think you didn't deliver 150 packages.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.600]   You know, it's the same thing I'm sure in the warehouses.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.560]   It's all based on stats.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.960]   But the computer should assist managers not take them over.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.440]   And there's reasons that you say, "I see somebody has potential," or they had a bad
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.440]   link.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440]   Or like that.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:07.280]   Like, like, like, you know, yeah, like I've had professors where, you know, you'd be like,
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.560]   you know, let's say you're no deaths, nothing.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.760]   I don't want your sob stories.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:16.120]   I just want the paper in, you know, at this time, which, okay.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.600]   But, you know, that's, I think it's a little.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.520]   That professor wouldn't have done very well in the pandemic.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.200]   I'll tell you for sure.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.440]   A lot of professors in the pandemic apparently were like that.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.440]   And even teachers.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.720]   They were just like, we had a couple of teachers like that that did not.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.360]   And I really gave them some slack because nobody was happy teaching a via Zoom.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.200]   And especially imagine teaching teenagers via Zoom.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.840]   That's really hard.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.520]   So I give them a little more slack than maybe I would have other ones.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.320]   But the teachers should give the students slack.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320]   And I agree.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.320]   I agree.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.680]   It's just hard for every.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.320]   This was a hard time for everybody, right?
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.120]   Extend some grace people.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.280]   Yes.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.720]   Give us some slack.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:04.720]   As what was that?
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:09.760]   A guy with a pipe Bob would say.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.280]   The church of the, what was that?
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.840]   The church of the.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.160]   This is too old even for me.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.960]   This is, this is out of my age bracket.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.840]   You don't know about the church of the subgenius?
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.880]   I don't know if this is out of my age bracket or just out of like the world as I know it.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.600]   I am J.R. Bob Dobbs.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.880]   Was a prophet of the church.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:34.880]   No.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.880]   What church?
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]   The church of the subgenius.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.720]   Where if you get to become perfect, you said, so you go to heaven.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:52.280]   There's no sidoku in heaven.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.560]   I hope there's sidoku in heaven.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.280]   There's no math in heaven.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.280]   That's how it's.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.280]   Be good.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   No math in heaven.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   Boy.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.200]   All right.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.680]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.080]   There are picks of the week, picks numbers, all of that stuff.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.000]   Let me as always, I think I should start with Stacey Higginbotham, she of the eternal
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]   waffle.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.760]   The eternal waffle.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.760]   I like that.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.760]   Okay.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.840]   First of all, I stuck a church.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.680]   Our lady of the eternal waffle.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.680]   I like that.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.680]   Yes.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.680]   I like that.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.680]   Yes.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.680]   I do worship at our lady.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.680]   Union waffles.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.160]   I'm telling you, communion waffles, you'll get converts from all.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.160]   Oh.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.600]   I want to say, Stacey, this is actually pretty.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.760]   I was a little skeptical about the new Nanolee Fellement that you showed us a couple of
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760]   weeks ago.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.040]   Here's your setup.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.240]   It looks pretty nice.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.880]   And I have since established a cord organizer.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.400]   Yeah, because that's Lisa would make me drill a hole in the wall, drop it down through
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:59.400]   the gap.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.400]   Yeah, that's a pain.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.440]   But I got plenty of, I got plenty of people recommended that to me and I'm like, I know
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.920]   right now I just organized it.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.000]   If I, if I think that's pretty.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.360]   So does it, does the texture change or what changes the color of the light?
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.040]   You don't have a video of this?
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.960]   No, I can take you out and show it to you.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.960]   Come on.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.360]   You're going to travel with me road trip on this weekend.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   Google.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.400]   Let's go somewhere with Stacey.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.360]   Audio is going to change.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.840]   That's okay.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.120]   We don't just shout.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.600]   This is a visual clue.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.200]   As they say, oh yeah, no one else.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.200]   Yes.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.200]   Yes.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.560]   It's phrases is a question.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560]   Oh no, she's frozen.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.000]   Oh no, she's frozen.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]   Unplugged it from something.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   Into comes back in three.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   Okay.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]   There we go.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]   In my back?
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]   Stacey Higgin bot.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   It's a Higgin bot.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.400]   We got a Higgin bot on.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.400]   Okay.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.400]   What's happening?
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.400]   Oh, I see.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.480]   My video went away.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   There we go.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480]   Perfect.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.480]   There we go.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   Look at that.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.920]   I got to get to a good angle.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.880]   Come on.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.120]   You don't have to be in the shot.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]   How about that?
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120]   No, that's good.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.120]   I mean, it's my computer.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.120]   It's a large.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.120]   Oh, I see.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.120]   That is really pretty.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.120]   It's a hallway.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.640]   And it's cycling through.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.040]   It looks like it's a molecule or something.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.280]   The nanoliefs are independent sexagons, right?
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.440]   There we go.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.440]   Six sided.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.440]   Hexagons.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.440]   Hexagons.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440]   Oh, no, it's five sides.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.080]   One, two, three, four, five.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080]   Six.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.080]   No, they're six sides.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.080]   Six of six of guns.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.080]   Sexagons.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.480]   And they light up independently.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.080]   They're attached to one another.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.280]   Is there a pattern you set or?
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.080]   This is one of their preset patterns.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.600]   I didn't bring my phone.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   Hold on.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.600]   Hexagon.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.160]   I'm not sure what word I was trying to remember.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.160]   Thank you.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.160]   Sexagons dummy.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.160]   Oh, I thought you said hexagon.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160]   Yeah, I would have told you.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160]   I have said it now.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.160]   Thank you to the chat room.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   We're really better at their Latin than I am.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   Hexagons.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.920]   And you could have it.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.520]   Is there an audio sensor?
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.320]   Could you have it bounce to the music?
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.880]   Yes, I'm about to do it here.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:26.120]   We're going to do something to.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120]   Okay.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120]   Ah, phone.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.120]   Sorry.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.000]   Is a hexagram or a hexagon?
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.160]   What's the difference to a hexagram and a hexagon or pentagram and a pentagon?
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.680]   That's the question.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.160]   A pentagram has five.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.640]   A hexagon has six.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:50.080]   Yeah, but what's the pentagram and hexagram and a gone?
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.080]   The pentagram is assuming.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.080]   Here it is.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.080]   So now it's reacting to my voice.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.080]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.080]   Well, you look at those hexagons.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080]   Go.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080]   I call you more.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.520]   Timber or what?
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.520]   It's here.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.200]   Well, I've been about to set everything off.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.200]   Sorry.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.200]   There's so much life.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200]   They're so bright.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   They're great.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200]   Oh, that didn't work.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200]   I'll go here.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200]   Hey, biscuit.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.200]   That's cool.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:21.840]   You know, I like because it's they look like natural materials.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.880]   There's a little stony and slady.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.520]   That's my floor.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:27.720]   Yeah, that's really nice.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   That's really nice.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.360]   I like it.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.680]   Two thumbs up.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.800]   That is that is Stacy's sexy guns.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.200]   Stacy's sexy guns and.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.200]   Oh, very nice.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.520]   It is the nano the nano leaf element, if you want to know more.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.520]   Very nice.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:44.520]   That's right.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:45.520]   I said your.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.520]   So that whole set up.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.000]   That set up was $800.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.800]   So know that.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:54.880]   Yeah, but we how much for peace of mind.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.120]   Well, and it covered a huge space.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.600]   It covers seven feet by almost four feet.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.000]   So you have, as they say, designed your personal oasis.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.840]   It was very nice.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.080]   Nano leaf dot me, if you want to know more.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.360]   Jeff, a number.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.080]   So 4.3 billion.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.320]   Holy cow.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]   That's a big number.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.880]   That is the SPAC IPO number, the valuation now for next door.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.240]   A company that never should have started because newspapers should have figured this
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.560]   out ages and ages ago how to start this on their own.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.320]   There were two damn stupid and they left open the opportunity and and.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.480]   Folks came in and figured it out and did a much better job.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.800]   I think I think it's very good.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.080]   I I had meetings with a neuro told you that's his name, right?
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.880]   Who is the founder co founder?
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:52.960]   I had meetings with them on his paper company years ago and they kind of said, we don't
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.760]   really need to do this paper.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.200]   You know, you're just another marketing place.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.200]   So you're manipulated.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.360]   I'm not so sure they were right.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.320]   So it's a SPAC from.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.600]   The node, CoSLA.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.680]   They had received 270 million.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:11.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.240]   They received raised over 200 million from venture capitalists most recently at a $2.2
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   billion valuation, including benchmark Raylock and Shasta.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.520]   Now it's a $4.3 billion SPAC.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.560]   And the deck, they say that they are in one in three US households or rather the households
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.200]   are in next door.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.600]   60 plus million verified neighbors.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   This was the key.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.480]   It was verified local identity.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480]   That was the whole thing.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480]   You had to have verified.
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:42.680]   You got to post you literally on a postcard of your house saying, yes, that's me.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.880]   I didn't have to do that when I joined if somebody else vouched for you.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.880]   But if you try to get in, they had up they had a backup post assistant because they really
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:54.120]   want people to be members who are in the neighborhood.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120]   Yes, yes.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.280]   And they've expanded pretty greatly the definition of neighborhood.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.520]   But be that as it may.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:05.240]   27 million weekly active neighbors or WANs.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.680]   At least they don't have a company song.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.000]   So I think it's an impressive company that's done well.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.680]   And yes, some neighborhoods aren't as pleasant as other neighborhoods.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.240]   And yes, there are jerks in the world and some of them are on next door.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.240]   But it's interesting.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.000]   One of the things interesting to me was I think they try to make themselves the unsocial
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:36.040]   network because they compared themselves differently to 82% of next door users did not
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.320]   visit snap in the last month.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.960]   64% linked in 63% Twitter, 27% Facebook or messenger.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.720]   They're trying to say, are people or different people?
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.760]   They aren't in all those lucky places.
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:52.400]   It's just like Google saying, don't call us a platform.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.040]   Don't mix us in with them.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.520]   They got two D's.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.680]   And so it's doing well.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:08.280]   They have a CEO who was at snap, Sarah Fryer, who replaced Dirov, Julia.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:11.480]   And they're doing well.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.080]   So congratulations to them.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.360]   Should have been newspapers, but it wasn't.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.720]   Yeah, I'm just looking at my next door.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.720]   Let's see.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:31.600]   Here's somebody warning about a plumber who ripped her off.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   The mountain lion.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   Has he been caught yet?
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   Do we know?
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.520]   I don't know.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.520]   If you're here's what to do.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.720]   If you encounter a mountain lion.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.320]   We get a lot of those too.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.520]   It says offer any handy small children run away while lion eats.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.080]   Okay, you can't trust everything you read.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   Smart.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:48:00.520]   Yeah, that to be the fastest.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.800]   Fireworks in the next person.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.200]   Hey certain neighbors.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.000]   Thanks for setting off the illegal fireworks.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.440]   My dog is now terrified.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.440]   You are a self is jerk.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.640]   Yeah, a lot of that on Twitter.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.560]   Yeah, I think you're reading my next door.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.280]   We have the mountain lion discussion.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280]   We have the virus.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.440]   Yeah, it's probably very I would imagine they're all pretty similar.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.120]   You get advertisers for homes for sale in your neighborhood, right?
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.440]   We had a bunch of extra boxes.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.760]   My wife went on an extra on saying they want them.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.600]   So I have recycled them and boom, somebody came and said thanks.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.160]   He saved us 40 bucks and boxes.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160]   They just picked them up.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.720]   Here's a fox eating somebody's chicken.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.640]   So I'm a little punk say everywhere.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:46.640]   Yeah, they like chickens too.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.640]   But so do I.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.080]   If you were a fox, you would be in the chicken capital of the world.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.080]   Exactly.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.080]   Where else would you be?
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.480]   Why they move there.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.720]   Free moving boxes.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.520]   Yeah, it's kind of boring, but it's kind of useful to.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:48:59.520]   That's the point.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:03.520]   Yeah, it's it's intentionally boring.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.600]   54% of my neighbors are on this.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.600]   Actually, I think it's more than that.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.880]   It says I have 144 neighbors out of 146 households.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.480]   So it sounds like almost everybody.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.800]   There's at least one person from almost every household.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:24.280]   So when I started my neighborhood in Hurricane Sandy, they said and I went for my street.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.240]   Rather, we live on because we're out here in the middle of nowhere next to Trump, you
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.280]   know, of course, there's only so many people I actually knew.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.840]   There's no, no, that's not enough neighbors.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:36.080]   I said, well, if I get enough neighbors for what you want me to, I'm going three miles
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.680]   away as people I don't know, you'll meet a verified people.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.120]   And right.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.400]   So they were kind of mixed up in the early days.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:48.880]   And then now, indeed, it's a much broader area because they want enough interactivity.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.000]   If you're in Silicon Valley, people have very active, you know, Palo Alto is just insanely
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000]   active.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.080]   So that's all you need is part of Palo Alto.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.920]   But another area is they expand it.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.920]   They also expanded.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.400]   So you have your home neighborhood and then your vacation home neighborhood and then your
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.800]   work neighborhood or whatever else else you want.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:10.440]   But the secret to this was when I talked to your optolio, the co-founder, he said, yeah,
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:14.320]   he said, I couldn't believe the newspapers didn't figure out that the whole point was
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.680]   verified identity and social networks didn't figure out verified identity.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.720]   And they found their niche and they built a huge company on it.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.000]   Here's another interesting thing.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000]   You can see which of your neighbors.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.600]   This is my area and which of the neighbors are signed up.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.720]   The green ones are signed up.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.520]   The pink ones are not.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.360]   So you can actually social jerks.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:40.400]   You can even see like, oh, hey, Peggy and Rolf aren't signed up.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.400]   That's really interesting.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.280]   You could see who is and who isn't signed up.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.440]   You should have angelized.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.480]   Hey, Peggy, come on.
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:52.480]   Very, you know, so what do you think worth 4.3 billion?
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.480]   I guess it is.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.520]   I mean, it's a real social network.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.080]   Wait, wait, are we assuming the stock market's based on anything?
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.080]   Sure.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.080]   It's worth it.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:04.480]   The stock market is the SPAC market.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.800]   Well, the SPACs are for the stock market.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.440]   What's the difference between a SPAC and an IPO?
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:16.040]   A SPAC is where private investors put the money up and then they merge with another company
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.200]   that's already public.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.040]   It's kind of like a pipe.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.560]   A SPAC is like a pipe.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.560]   Hey, please.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.560]   Oh, what?
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.560]   A SPAC.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:30.880]   So basically, a SPAC is where you have a big public company or sorry, you have a big
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:33.920]   pool of investors or maybe one investor.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:38.760]   And then they are a shell corporation that's already listed on the stock exchange.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:39.760]   And then--
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.240]   So they've already been gone public in effect.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.920]   Yeah, they're already public.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.920]   They just didn't have to go through that.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:46.920]   They just didn't have to go through that.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.920]   Yes.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.720]   And a pipe-- what did a pipe stand for?
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.960]   They were all the rage and like the pink sheets pipe.
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:55.360]   Oh, that's not going to help pipe financial industry.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.360]   I won't make you explain things about.
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   That's okay.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360]   We really didn't want to go through that.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.400]   We want to go down this road to rabbit hole rubber hole.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:06.720]   Can I explain how Sadoku can really be an entryway?
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.520]   I'm sorry, you guys.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.640]   You asked these questions.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.280]   No, you sufficiently answered this SPAC versus IPO.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.400]   And why people want to do that?
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.440]   Because it's faster and eliminates a lot of the regulatory paperwork.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.680]   Yeah, you could avoid a lot of SOCKs issue.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.040]   Well, you still have to eventually have accounting.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.040]   But yeah.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040]   So once they're in this coast--
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.040]   What's the difference?
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.040]   There's covening--
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.200]   Acquisition Fund.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.280]   They're now merged with this.
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.960]   So they're now technically public.
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.560]   People could buy stock in next door.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.560]   Right?
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.800]   They'll buy a stock in the company that is next door.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:41.800]   Right.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:42.800]   So I don't know if--
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.800]   So whatever they--
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:45.800]   And it could become next door.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.800]   But--
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.800]   Sure.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.800]   Yes.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.800]   But they'll--
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.800]   Well, they'll trust it.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.800]   Well, actually, they won't be able to buy-- they'll-- they're not buying it at the IPO.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.560]   They're just buying like publicly on the market.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.080]   So does that same fund?
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.000]   Is it able to do this again?
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]   Or no, it's one fund--
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]   No, they have to create a company.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]   Because you're now the company.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000]   In fact, it will fund--
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.640]   They have to find a show, yeah.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.400]   This will help you understand.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:11.280]   This is the particular name of this is something like Coastal Adventures SPAC number two.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.280]   Right.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:16.880]   It's specifically designed to do for this purpose entirely.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.880]   Interesting.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.280]   But you form it not knowing what you're going to--
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.440]   You don't know ahead of time.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]   And I guess--
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.160]   But the question is, where's the money flow from?
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.080]   It flows initially from the SPAC company buying next door.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.080]   Right?
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.280]   No, it flows from private investors.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:36.760]   So what happens is like maybe hedges, maybe it's your best buddies that you met through
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.040]   LinkedIn, you all get your money together.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:44.120]   You basically build this SPAC, which is the corporation.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:46.640]   You find a publicly traded company.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.640]   You buy said company or you--
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:51.240]   Or non-publicly traded company, a private company.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:52.240]   Oh, no.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.120]   You first you buy a publicly traded company to become public.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.440]   I don't know your order of operations.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:03.880]   I think you create the pool of money, you find the public target, or you find the private
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:04.880]   target.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.560]   I don't know which comes first in this situation.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.280]   So there are investors who put money into this, basically.
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:11.280]   Yes.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:17.720]   I mean, but in most of them know where-- I mean, when you have this pool of money, you
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.520]   know what you're-- it's not like they're like a giant floating pool of money that's
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:23.520]   looking around.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:27.400]   A giant floating pool of money that was-- they've had the discussions with Nextdoor already.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   Okay.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.400]   All right.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.400]   All right.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.640]   And then it's FAC.
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.520]   So there was $270 million prior investment.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:37.160]   That is a pipe according to this.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.160]   That's the money coming in.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.880]   I already came into it.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.080]   And whatever equity they had, the total valuation is $4.3 billion.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.540]   How much money do we-- do we imagine-- I don't see anything here-- of how much the
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:54.820]   COSL and company put in, and then I don't understand how that mixes.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:58.100]   Because when you do an IPO, you do it to get money.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.420]   In this case, new money.
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:05.140]   This case is everybody who's involved selling off their equity to the public market.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.540]   I don't understand how that works.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:08.540]   No.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:15.500]   So what'll happen is this is basically like a set of investors coming in and giving you--
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:17.900]   I'm just going to make up a number of $4 billion, right?
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:21.900]   So $4 billion goes to next door.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:28.900]   And next door will work with them to take some of that money to do the deal to get them
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:30.940]   on the public market.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.940]   And then the rest of that money is just liquidity for next door.
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:41.060]   So that could be-- and then the stock that the next door people have, like they're-- what
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.060]   are those called?
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.020]   They're shares and stuff like that.
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:49.580]   Actually, those should translate into the publicly-- whatever the exchange--
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:55.740]   As a company can create more shares.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:59.140]   But that's no different.
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:05.780]   When a company goes public anyway, when you do an IPO, the bankers and the people who
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:09.860]   buy into the IPO are going to-- they only raise like $250 million.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:13.820]   What happens is when they go on the trading markets, they hopefully pop.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:16.140]   And then suddenly they're worth a billion.
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:20.660]   And that's when your shares, if you're a person who has shares in that company and
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:26.380]   the employees and stuff, that's when you can start selling them in a Korean value.
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.380]   After a wait period.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:30.620]   It's not at the actual IPO point.
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.420]   That's when your investors sell their shares.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.660]   I think they just trade them in.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:39.220]   But it's a big sheet down the road.
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.220]   What's the difference between a pink sheet and a fushion sheet?
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.220]   Stop it.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.220]   No time for Ant-Pruise.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.220]   Saturation in you.
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:48.220]   Ant-Pruise.
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:53.140]   Now you're talking his language.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:55.980]   Ant-Pruise, pick of the week.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:57:02.220]   Well, mine will not be as astute as our previous two picks here.
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.220]   Good grief.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:07.220]   Have you ever heard of that movie "View From the Top"?
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:10.380]   Yeah, why do I know that name?
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:14.940]   I'd heard of it, never seen it, but apparently it's at least a decade old.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:15.940]   Oh, Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:16.940]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:17.940]   Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:18.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:23.800]   Well, friend of mine, Liana said, "I should check out Richard A.U.I.D.'s "View From the
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:28.300]   Top" on Audible, one of our sponsors.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:32.020]   And it's a hilarious book about a movie I never saw.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:39.220]   Basically, he's just retelling the movie in his own voice, different scenes and just
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.900]   giving his own spin on it.
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:42.100]   And he throws in a couple of different--
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.620]   You must like it a lot.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.940]   Oh, I love it.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:50.180]   And then throw in a lot of some of his own personal stories and things like that.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:54.140]   There's a scene in that movie that's shot for Christmas or whatever.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:58:01.220]   And he starts to talk about his own experience with Christmas, with this family and having
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.620]   to clean up all day long with this mom and having snacks with this dad and how he now
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:12.900]   associates snack time with crying because his dad likes to have onions as a snack.
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:16.180]   So he makes some chopped up onions.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.780]   It was just a really, really funny, funny book.
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:24.540]   I did eventually watch the movie not too long ago and it just made that movie much more enjoyable
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.540]   or more difficult.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.540]   It was otherwise I wouldn't have watched it.
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]   Yeah, it's a rom-com.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:29.100]   I'm so glad that's all it is.
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:30.100]   So here's the question.
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:34.460]   Should you watch the movie and then read the book or should you read the book?
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:36.820]   And the order you chose, which is read the book first.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:39.980]   And then read the book first, read the book first and then watch the movie.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.980]   Okay.
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.980]   She's a steward.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.380]   And if you watch the IT crowd, you probably love Moss from the IT crowd.
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.620]   That's who Richard, all you I do is.
[01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.820]   Oh, of course.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:50.860]   He's so funny.
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:52.220]   So it's a funny book.
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.220]   Yes.
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.220]   Yes.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.220]   All right.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:59:00.980]   And my last pick of the week, this is just selfishly rooting for this young man.
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:01.980]   His name is Sai.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:04.300]   And I put his tweet out there.
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:09.420]   He just got a scholarship offer from university of Nevada for football.
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.620]   And he hasn't committed to anything yet.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:17.060]   But I'm selfishly rooting for this young man because he's the number one wired receiver
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:18.220]   on the football team.
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.500]   And my son happens to be the quarterback.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:24.860]   So hopefully with his success, the son, you know, hardhead will be able to get a little
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.380]   bit more success too.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.380]   Nice.
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.380]   Nice.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.380]   All right.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:30.780]   So we're rooting for him.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.780]   Sai.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.780]   Go, Sai, go.
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:33.780]   Go, Sai, go.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:34.780]   Go, Sai.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:39.020]   I remember you from the top now, not a great movie.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:42.260]   I'm like steward has never watched that movie.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.260]   But apparently he likes it a lot.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.820]   Oh, it was so funny.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:47.820]   Just listening to his.
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:48.820]   I might have to.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:49.820]   I think you're right.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:52.100]   I think I'm going to listen to the book.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:54.300]   Not watch the movie again.
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.180]   And there you have it.
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:59.460]   Two great picks from the great Ant-Pruit hands on photography.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.220]   What's coming up on op?
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:02.500]   Oh, right.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:07.700]   So this week I get to sit down with Mr. David Bergman.
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:12.580]   He's a great photographer, concert photographer for 30 plus years and sports photography.
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:15.140]   And he's going to drop some knowledge on us this week.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:16.140]   Nice.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.140]   Looking forward to it.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:18.140]   Sports photography.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:21.940]   Yeah, that's a very technical field concert and sports photography.
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:22.940]   Tough.
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:23.940]   So I will listen.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:25.740]   That sounds very interesting.
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:27.220]   Thank you, Ant-Pruit.
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.500]   Thank you, Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:31.100]   Stacey on IOT.com is her website.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.460]   There's a great newsletter there.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.460]   Check the events.
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:37.140]   And of course, the IOT podcast she does with Kevin Tofel.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:39.060]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:40.060]   No.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.060]   No.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.060]   Okay.
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.060]   Thank you.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.060]   Just Leo.
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:48.020]   Leo, didn't you want to, didn't you have a tip, a Sudoku tip for us?
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:50.180]   Well, I actually.
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:51.620]   No.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:01:01.060]   I did recommend one of the videos on that channel as being one of the best Sudoku videos ever.
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.060]   And you would know.
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:04.060]   And nobody.
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:09.380]   Oh, no, 372,000 people, right?
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:10.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:13.940]   Let me see if I actually, I think I have a blog.
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:18.140]   Oh, no, I actually use a picture of the service.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:19.140]   I don't know.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:21.620]   Just trying to remember.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:26.820]   Yeah, it was kind of a while ago.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:33.420]   I can find it for you.
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:34.420]   No.
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:37.420]   No, I don't have a search on this blog.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:38.420]   It's okay.
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.340]   All right.
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.340]   Almost there.
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:42.340]   I've gone through.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.340]   Oh, there it is.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.900]   The Miracle Sudoku.
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:47.700]   25 minutes that will blow your mind.
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.740]   Do you like Sudoku?
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:52.340]   Please have this in the show.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:55.460]   This video will give you a visceral thrill.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.300]   I stayed away for 25 minutes of this.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:58.300]   I can't believe it.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:01.540]   My mind is blown.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:07.380]   It's from the crap cracking the crapping the cryptic YouTube channel, which I subscribe
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:08.380]   to.
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:14.660]   And actually, you really should should watch this video because you will have a new appreciation
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:19.220]   for Sudoku and the Sudoku that could never be solved.
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:20.220]   Hello.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.940]   Welcome to Sunday's edition of Cracking the Cryptic.
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:22.940]   The eternal Sudoku.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:25.820]   They safe during lockdown.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:31.980]   This guy who is a Sudoku genius, a world champion solver, was sent this puzzle by his
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:33.860]   friend, his co-host on the show.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.460]   And he said, I thought he was punking me.
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:42.940]   A big thanks for the lovely responses we had for yesterday's celebration.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.500]   Look, trust me.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.100]   It's the 25 minutes that will blow your mind, Jeff.
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:49.460]   That's a very emotional video for us.
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:50.700]   It's incredible.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:51.700]   It's incredible.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:54.340]   I hope this is in the show, this because I will watch this, sir.
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:55.340]   Yeah.
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:57.780]   Well, it's on my blog from the couch from last May.
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:00.180]   I'm just sucking up to the boss there.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:01.180]   No, watch this.
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.500]   You got the wrong pruit, sir.
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:10.020]   I'm putting it in the chat for you there.
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:11.260]   Thank you, kindly.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.260]   There you go.
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:16.460]   Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen, the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.460]   at the...
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:23.620]   Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.420]   The problem is it's like dancing.
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:31.500]   We can't all lead at the City University of New York.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:35.220]   Always a pleasure.
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:36.220]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:38.180]   Buzzmachine.com, your blog, anything?
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.180]   No.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.820]   25 minutes that will blow your mind?
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:42.820]   No.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:43.820]   Okay.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:47.060]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.800]   We do this week in Google of a Wednesday afternoon, around about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.980]   Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:04:01.540]   If you want to watch us make the show, we have a live behind the scenes stream at twit.tv/live.
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:03.620]   There's audio and video there.
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:07.100]   People who do watch live often like to chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:13.260]   And of course, Club Twits, another way you can chat in our Discord server.
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:19.140]   Club Twits gives us the chance to take $7 out of your pocket every month to help defray
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:22.220]   the costs, supports the network.
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.780]   It's a nice way to show your support and you get some benefits.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:29.420]   Besides the great Discord chat, you also get all of our shows, add free audio or video
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:30.420]   your choice.
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:32.420]   You can listen to them all and watch them all.
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.540]   You can do both if you want, I guess.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:38.020]   And there's also a Twit Plus feed with stuff that doesn't make it...
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:41.580]   Sometimes some of the best conversations happen before and after the shows, those make it
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:43.300]   into the Twit Plus feed.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:49.100]   So if you're interested, twit.tv/club, Twit, thank you in advance.
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:52.460]   And I will now say a fond farewell to you all.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:55.100]   I'm going to be in Hawaii next week.
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:57.020]   I'll be back in two weeks.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:00.300]   I mean, we miss you for two weeks or?
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.300]   No, just one week.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:02.300]   Just one week.
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.100]   I'll be back a week from Wednesday.
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:05.100]   Yeah.
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.300]   And of course, I'm doing Twitter on Sunday.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:08.540]   I'm not leaving until Monday.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:09.540]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.780]   Because they're the ones you don't want to miss.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:12.780]   Please miss.
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:15.300]   This show is no big.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:16.420]   No, I am missing a Twit.
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:20.180]   I am missing a Twit, actually, a week from Sunday I'm missing.
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.580]   Jason Snow will be following.
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:25.340]   It's just that he feels that we can handle it, Jeff.
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:26.340]   That's right.
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:27.340]   Very good, Mark.
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:28.340]   Very good.
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:29.940]   He'll play.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.900]   That's the way to make the kids feel good about themselves.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:36.740]   So the Sudoku puzzle, he doesn't give him any clues at all.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:39.660]   He's got to solve the whole thing.
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:43.140]   I have to leave to pick up my power.
[02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:48.660]   With just two numbers, the whole thing following traditional.
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.220]   But there is one little thing.
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:56.260]   Any two cells separated by a knight's move or a king's move cannot contain the same digit.
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:06:00.180]   And any two orthogonally adjacent cells cannot contain consecutive digits.
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:05.140]   So there's a little extra rule that makes this the most interesting Sudoku puzzle.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:07.140]   You've been such revealing show.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.140]   You're so beautiful.
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:11.460]   It's definitely esoteric.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:15.620]   Don, you watch the video.
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:17.780]   You will appreciate Sudoku.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:21.820]   Actually, you won't because if you don't understand Sudoku, the video makes no sense
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:23.460]   at all.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:24.460]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:26.620]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:27.620]   Bye bye.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:29.980]   Hey, I hope you enjoyed that episode.
