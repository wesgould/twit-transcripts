[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.320]   Mr. Andy Inotko, who has been at the Apple iPad announcement
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   event just minutes ago, wrapped up.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.560]   Andy's in his hotel lobby.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.920]   And he's going to give us his take on iPad 2.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.960]   Thanks for joining us, Andy.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   We're finally getting in here.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   I hope that people will enjoy this shot of my nose.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   But that's good.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.360]   There was live videos for you, Tony, in the internet today.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.480]   Yeah, well, I agree.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.560]   Gina Trapani is also here from San Diego,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.880]   where she has already decided she's buying an iPad 2.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.840]   I have.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   I want to talk about it.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   I'm the trainer.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   I'm the trainer.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.720]   That's what Jeff Jarvis says.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.800]   Jeff is the blogger at Buzzmachine.com, the author of what
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   Google do.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.400]   Of course, Gina's smarterware.org.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.560]   Welcome all time to talk about Google and the cloud.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.120]   Although, I guess because Android tablets are the hot item,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.320]   in fact, you could buy a Zoom.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.800]   Anybody have a Zoom yet?
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   Andy, did you get a Zoom?
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.600]   I have a Zoom in the house for testing.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400]   It's probably going to go back a few weeks.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.880]   But yeah, I have for a couple now.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.280]   X-O-O-M, that's the Motorola Honeycomb-based tablet.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   And one of the things that I thought was very surprising
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   was Steve Jobs taking direct aim at Honeycomb.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.000]   He had a little B icon that he would
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.120]   use to show how useless Honeycomb was, how few apps and all
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080]   of that.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   As far as I can remember, Steve himself
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.320]   making such targeted attacks at competitors.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.120]   Usually, it's considered better to not mention the competition.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.840]   But obviously, Steve felt like this is time to go after Andrew
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.340]   Wright.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.320]   Did you notice that, Andy?
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.760]   I mean, the iPad 2 was just one of the two sets
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.600]   of announcements at this show.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   Mostly, it was there to demonstrate,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.720]   not just that the iPad will continue
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.040]   to be competitive against all these new tablets coming out
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.000]   in 2011.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.720]   The message was actually that we do not expect to have any
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.280]   competition through 2011.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   We have seen the enemy, and he is not us.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.200]   Yeah, it was a very self-congratulatory event.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.760]   I mean, a long video at the beginning
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.720]   about how great the iPad was.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.520]   I didn't see the video, but it seemed like it was kind
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.280]   of a tear-jerker.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.440]   It was your basic talking head in front of a white screen
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.800]   sort of thing, how it's helping doctors.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.720]   It's helping kids with certain disabilities.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.280]   There was a lot of--
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.840]   it is the magical device that's working
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.120]   its magic towards all of humanity.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200]   Not sickening, but it was definitely up there.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.080]   And yet, Gina--
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   It's very nice.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.400]   And yet, Gina, you drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.160]   I did.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.880]   I've been in the market for a tablet for a while.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.040]   Ever since I sold my Kindle, I've decided
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000]   I wanted to get a tablet.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.920]   And I wanted to wait to see what the first official Google
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.200]   tablet would be, which is basically the Zoom with Honeycomb.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.440]   And then I wanted to wait, which I was very tempted by.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   I nearly had a meltdown and best buy last week.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.080]   I was like, it's really cool, I thought.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   But I said, OK, you know what?
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.240]   I got to wait until Wednesday, March 2,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   just to hear what Apple has to say.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.440]   And I decided I'm going to get the iPad, just because honestly,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.000]   to me, it's like, first of all, I'm
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.880]   just a-- I'm pretty conservative when it comes to buying gadgets.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.600]   I feel much more comfortable buying second generation.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.960]   It's so thin.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.720]   And it just-- the two cameras, the fact
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200]   that it's been on the market for a year now
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.000]   and has apps that have been developed for the platform,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.320]   is really attracted to me.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.680]   And honestly, just as a developer and as a commentator,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.920]   I haven't used iOS seriously in a long time.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.240]   And I want to just be able to make sort of an informed
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.200]   and objective comparisons between Android and iOS.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.080]   I mean, so many of my heroes, like the Marco Arman,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.600]   even the groupers, who I know is just a big Apple fan,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.840]   they insist that iOS has this magic in it that Android doesn't.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.520]   And I want to kind of understand that a little more.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.080]   So yeah, I'm going to get the iPad.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.440]   I'm going to develop for the iPad.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.320]   I'm porting my app from Android to iOS,
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.000]   which is a big part of my reason.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.040]   And I'm going to be able to be on both sides of the fans.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.280]   I also use Windows 7 and Mac OS X as well.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.040]   Similarly--
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.080]   In all fairness, I have both since I have my iPhone
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.760]   and my Galaxy DAMB.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   So I'm--
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.440]   I'm iOS myself.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   Yeah, I'm bi-try.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.520]   Get for Linux in the mix.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.120]   Are you going to get a-- what do they call it?
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.160]   The Smart Case, the Smart Cover?
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   I don't know how it's smart.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.920]   It's a bit of rubber with magnets.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.200]   Well, it's magnetic, right?
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.520]   The magnets are smart?
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.640]   It's pretty damn cool.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.080]   Because not only does it add practically nothing
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.680]   to the size of the case, if you would have seen me
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.080]   like at the demo area, trying to play out the game where
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.920]   I bet there's a little mouse inside the refrigerator
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.080]   who turns off and on the light.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   If I open and close the door really quick,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.000]   I can get that and catch them.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.880]   So does it turn on the screen when you flip the cover back?
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   It's incredible.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.200]   I mean, even if you pull the screen off
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.560]   and the screen wakes and the lights wakes up,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.720]   you close it and automatically goes to sleep.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.680]   And then I was actually shooting video of this.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.200]   I'm kind of pathetic.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.680]   If you just lift up a corner of it and slap it back down
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.120]   for that fraction of a second that that corner is up,
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.000]   it wakes up and then swim sleeps again.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.760]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.360]   You wait until you actually hold one of these in your hands.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.920]   You would think that, my god, I can't believe I'm actually
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.320]   waxing poetic about a damn cover.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.440]   But it's awful.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.200]   They can't just say, well, what if we just
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.400]   mold something out of vinyl and slip it in there?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.760]   It's no, it's going to have magical magnetic connectors.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.440]   It automatically finds the right place.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.560]   It automatically interacts with the device itself.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   I had to say that's pretty impressive.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.000]   That's pretty impressive that they could get people,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.120]   especially since this is pure profit.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.200]   I mean, it's a piece of rubber with magnets that cost $30.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.440]   Andy, what do you think that if you had the iPad with the cup
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.120]   on it?
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.720]   Sorry.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.080]   Andy's a little lagged because he's in the hot pot.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.360]   Right, because he's on the Wi-Fi.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.560]   Is that cover?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.480]   My concern about the cover, I totally dig the magnet idea.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.000]   Is it-- it looks a little flimsy.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.280]   Am I going to take the iPad with just that cover,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.000]   without the wraparound, put it in my bag with maybe
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.880]   a regular notebook and a couple other items,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.960]   and it's not going to come off.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.680]   I mean, those magnets strong, is it really
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.760]   going to protect the screen in a bag with other things?
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.560]   Or am I going to need a sleeve on top of that cover?
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.960]   The magnet is really, really, very strong.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   I actually lifted up the iPad on those magnets.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Really?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.560]   I didn't-- I didn't-- I wasn't just like,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.760]   twitching it around, but I carefully lifted it up,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   and yeah, it did actually come up with the thing.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.840]   I think that you're more in-- the only thing
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.960]   that I would be worried about is when I put it
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.880]   in this big noisy bag with all the stuff in it,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.280]   is the magnet-- are the magnets going to be
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.720]   attracted to anything else in the bag?
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.400]   Will it be possible for me to sort of like,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.960]   share the magnets off the side of it?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   But the thing is, when the cover is in place,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.120]   and here's the bottom line, it really
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.360]   feels as though it's a built-in cover that's held on firmly
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.920]   by screws.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.080]   Once you put this on, it really does
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.480]   feel as though it was a design element.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   It really is Apple.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.960]   Apple explaining that the reason--
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.360]   it's not $39 because it's $39 for the stuff.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.160]   It's $39 because we put about $100 worth of thought
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.440]   into how to make a cover for this device.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.360]   Wow.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.920]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.160]   If you really want to spend money,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   you can also get a $70 leather version of the same thing.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.120]   I can't believe that I'm going to buy this freaking cover,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   but I am.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.360]   Well, you know why you almost don't have to,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.160]   because all the existing iPad covers
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.520]   will block the camera.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.880]   So you-- but they'll--
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.600]   I'm sure they're going to switch to the new one soon.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.520]   But it has another really cool trick on it.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.360]   If you roll it up, there are magnets
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.400]   actually inside the cover itself that
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.960]   will turn it into a wedge that will hold it at the right type
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.800]   of angle or--
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.840]   so it's not like it will fall apart.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.720]   And Apple says that this isn't going to be
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   like MagSafe connectors where they own the technology
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.680]   and you have to buy a license to use it.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.440]   Essentially, if you want to design something that has magnets,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   then it's a magnet.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:58.960]   Oh, that's wrong.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   It's a magnet.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   It's a magnet.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.560]   There's magnets in the iPad, so it really
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.920]   is a strong bond as well as in the car.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   Exactly.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.680]   I think it's the old Act Leo, Senior Wences loss.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   Senior Wences.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.360]   Hello, Eddie.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.160]   Hello, Eddie.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.080]   Hello, Eddie.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.440]   It's nothing to you, Gina.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.160]   What does it mean?
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.040]   It means nothing to me.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.160]   What does it have to do with that?
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   Is it a senior Wences cover?
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.840]   It's like a little box.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.160]   You say hello, hello, hello.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.120]   Hello, hello.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.800]   That's the way the fix strikes me.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   It's $39.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.000]   It was pure profit for Apple.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.080]   It's really what it is.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   Actually, I think you've just defined
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.280]   the iPad 2 version of the Flashlight app.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   The first guy who does a senior Wences app
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   that does whatever lifts up exactly.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   It says hello.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   It says hello.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   It says hello.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.200]   It'll make $100,000 in the month and then never saw another one after two months.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.800]   It also reminds me of Quick Draw McGry.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.120]   And Babaloui, all right?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   Saturday.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.840]   I wonder if they can expose the magnet API to developers that are available to the
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   Internet.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.040]   I can't believe we're talking about a magnet freaking magnet API.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   There it is.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.880]   Let me just show you the hello.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   Hello, Eddie.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   I'm going to go back here.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   This is this magnet API.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.560]   Well, you know, there is an open magnet API that all Apple devices are now supporting.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   There is.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   That's the senior Wences moment.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   Hello, hello.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   Hey Babaloui, Saturday.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.560]   Saturday, Saturday, Debbie.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   Oh, hello.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.760]   Hello, chat, web, web, 16, 47, the show says damn Jeff is so old.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.800]   Well, if Jeff's old, I'm as old.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.080]   So, oh, we lost Danny.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.280]   Let's get him back on.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   So, what is it, Gina, though?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.600]   You don't have an Android tablet?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   I do not.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   I do not have an Android tablet.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.280]   What is it about this that makes you want it?
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   The iPad?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.440]   The fact that it's been around for a year and apps are built for it, that it's mature,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.480]   that it's so light that the battery life is so long, the zoom's battery life wasn't great.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.160]   The form factor on the iPad just looks looks amazing.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.840]   I mean, listen, I'm not saying that I won't ever have a honeycomb tablet.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.600]   I just think that it's just too early.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   I kind of felt this.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.840]   I didn't get the iPad when it first came out because I kind of felt like, "Let this be
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.840]   out for a while.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.960]   I haven't decided whether or not there's room for a tablet or I need a tablet."
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.600]   But once I sold my Kindle, I was like, "I want a tablet."
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.280]   It seems clear to me that right now, at this moment in time, the iPad is the most superior
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.680]   tablet on the market, not to say that an Android tablet won't catch up at some point.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.400]   But yeah, it looks really cool.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.000]   I fell for the whole case thing.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.920]   I'm going to buy the case.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.600]   So Annie, you've held it because they had a demo room.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.240]   Does it feel lighter and thinner?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.960]   Is it noticeable difference?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   It really does.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.680]   I mean, I had my iPad with me, obviously, and I was holding both of them in my hands.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.440]   I'm sorry, but I don't know how they got all that space out of it.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.360]   But by the time you're holding an iPad 2 in your hands, you feel so you're holding the
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.720]   finished object of any use whatsoever you've ever held your hand.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.120]   It's just a bottom.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.960]   I actually had to put them both screen down side by side to make sure I wasn't just
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.480]   imagining that, "Oh, I bet they just tapered the edges down."
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.240]   No, it is that much thinner.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.040]   It feels that much thinner.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.120]   And after having spent the past two or three weeks playing with a whole bunch of different
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.440]   honeycomb tablets, nothing on Android.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.960]   When a consumer comes in with a $700, $700 in a pocket with a desire to buy a tablet,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.040]   nobody is going to pick up an iPad 2 and anything else and thinks that anything else
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   is in that same class.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.360]   That kind of a response to it.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.880]   My problem, at this point, I could probably save face by saying, "Well, no, it has two
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   cameras."
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   Of course.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   A carorcel.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.120]   Yeah, Jeff, we should just to rub it in, point out that very famously had a reboxing
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   of his iPad.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.960]   But your reboxing was more about the fact that it's a consumption of iPad 2.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   It was political.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   It was.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   It was.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.120]   But the problem I have now really is I'm addicted to the size of the Galaxy tab.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.200]   I'm addicted to my pocket and I'm thumb typing.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   I imagine.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.400]   So I'm gadget, not.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.360]   Honey, I really need to have the iPad because my students are developing newspaper things.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   I used to see what we're doing.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   I can play it up.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   I can do it, right?
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.560]   But then I don't know how I use it still because it will fit my pocket.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.840]   Well, here's one thing.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.200]   Speaking to that original objection that I thought was very interesting, they really
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.440]   emphasized GarageBand and iMovie in the talk today.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.960]   And it does, in a way, address that issue of it being a content consumption device.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   Very much more with the camera.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   Well, the cameras, why?
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.640]   The camera, those two applications, the ability to shoot 720p video, it does look a little
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   bit more like a content creation device.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.240]   And I tell you, with the camera apps on iOS, that's going to be an impressive camera.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   I think the different message entirely.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.640]   I think one of the main reasons why they pushed out those two apps is because they are
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.960]   really going to be banner holders for.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.920]   Here's the difference between how good an app can be on an iPad.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   And please, please, consumer, go ahead and compare this to any app you'd like on Android.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.600]   There really underscores the general attitude of we don't feel as though there's going
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.360]   to be any competition for the iPad in 2011.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.720]   Although your point is very well made, I did spend some time building things with iMovie
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.480]   and with GarageBand.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.960]   And boy, the iPad version of iMovie might be one of my favorite video editors.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.040]   Speaking of somebody who always hates video editors.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.560]   No, it's a natural way to edit.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.120]   It's handling it.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   It's very visceral.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.200]   And that clearly is what Apple's starting to say.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.720]   And I think that with the new laptops, with Thunderbolt on them and the ability to do a
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.200]   touch screen, I think iOS and touch is going to move.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.320]   This is in a way pushing us more in that direction of full screen apps, which OS 10
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.240]   Lion will support iOS interface style interfaces.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.160]   I know Steve says we don't want to reach out and touch and I agree with him on a laptop
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.480]   screen, but I have to say it's such a natural interface for some things like GarageBand
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.440]   and like iMovie that we're going to be clamoring, I think, for that ability.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.880]   One of my other issues back when was the difficulty of getting stuff on it without a
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   USB.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.520]   Well, you found using it now.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.240]   I think one thing they did that was stunning is this HDMI mirroring adapter, which means
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.880]   you it's now a home theater device.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:26.360]   You put not only not only that, but the fact that every single iOS app gets videoing,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.120]   video mirroring, I'll just support it.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.440]   It doesn't really take that.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.480]   Take the nine times graphical performance and also take the fact that it has a built-in
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.280]   gyroscope and think about the games that can be built with this thing.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.200]   This is a controller for your big screen TV.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Exactly.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.800]   You plug that into an HDTV now and you will have something pretty formidable as a gaming
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   device.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Very intriguing.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   Interesting.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.720]   Did you find out Andy, because they don't say it anywhere even in the tech specs on
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.200]   the website, what the resolution of that rear-facing camera is?
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   No, I mean, I'm not.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.840]   All they've said is, I did try to email myself a picture about no-go.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.280]   You know, I'm going to guess that it's the same as the iPhone 4, but it may not be that
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   good.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.160]   All they said is 720p, 30 frame per second video, but you know, you could do that with
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.680]   a flip cam with upscaling.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.120]   They don't say native 720p, so until we know the resolution, that could be a sticking point.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.600]   I'm not going to even guess.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   Interesting.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.800]   What I found interesting with the fact that the camera app or the iPad is identical to
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.360]   the camera app for the iPhone.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.000]   So you do have selective focus.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.360]   You do have selective exposure, but it's not as though they decided to use that extra
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.760]   screen real estate to put some extra features in the app.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.600]   It is just the same app you get before.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.360]   Well, that's an opportunity for people like Lisa Bettany and third party camera apps.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   You're right, Gina.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   I know what Gina's going like this.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.960]   Am I going to be walking around taking pictures like this?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   It's kind of weird.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   It's slab in my head, you know?
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.160]   I think you are.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.680]   I think you're going to get used to it.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.840]   And I think especially with video, I can see this because this is a full screen monitor.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.040]   I mean, I can see you shooting video like this and you're really seeing what you're getting.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   Right.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   Right.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   Andy, did you try Movie Studio in Honeycomb and how did you think that it compares to iMovie?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.320]   I did try Movie Studio.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.400]   I didn't build anything, start to finish with it, but partially because I was kind of thrown
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.200]   off by the interface.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.320]   I think that the Movie Studio is a functional app.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.720]   I think that iMovie is an app you'll use because you'll want to use it.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.320]   I'd rather movie studio, you use it because it's the app that's on the device.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   It's just switching out.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   Okay, yeah.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.120]   Whereas iMovie is going to be, hey, since I'm waiting for my plane anyway, why don't
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.000]   I cut together a really good video and post it to Facebook, post it to YouTube, post it
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.720]   to CNN before my flight boards.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Interesting.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.840]   See, this would be really interesting for me because I'm not a movie editing girl.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   I just movie editing.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.040]   I love it and I took a weekend long workshop on it and it took me literally eight hours
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.520]   to cut together my final project, which was about five minutes, right?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.680]   So it's like I love it, but it's exhausting.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.760]   It takes so much time.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.160]   So I'm really interested to see whether or not iMovie on the iPad will move me and be
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.240]   easy enough for me to do more of that.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   Not to turn this into Mac Prick weekly, as they say in the chatroom right now, but...
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.520]   Well, we're going to get to Google stuff with Andy Gobi.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.680]   This is a big story we're going to cover.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   I agree.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.520]   I'm asking questions.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:29.040]   So, the changes that I will get on my iPhone that includes Hot Spot?
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   Well...
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.440]   Yes, there's also a preview of iOS 4.3, which is going to be released the same day as the
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   iPad.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.560]   And yes, mobile Hot Spot is coming to every phone that runs 4.3, so you will have an
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.320]   AT&T as well as Verizon.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.080]   It will not be available on the iPad, though.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.120]   What remains to be seen is how much AT&T might charge you for it, so for it.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   So what kind of limitations a carrier might put on it?
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.920]   What it says is that in terms of...
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.880]   Because Hot, by the way, Hot Spot has been available on in Europe, right?
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   This is not new.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:10.400]   But if I were to get an iPad, one can now more easily get it without a phone contract.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   Get the 499.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.000]   Well, you can always get it from 499, but a phone contract.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Well, but you could use your...
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You must use it right now.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Yeah, use your iPhone to have your...
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   You have an iPhone or you have Android phone.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.840]   So now you can be pretty much guaranteed of Hot Spot.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   Right.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   Then...
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.080]   Then you don't need 3G, because you got the 3G here.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.680]   And then it just kind of beams it over.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.120]   Problem with that for my Galaxy tab, the reason I went back and switched to getting it.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.000]   A was because it has Hot Spot, I mean, it's Hot Spot.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.320]   B, because I wanted to do the mobile stuff with it, so I wanted it to be mobile aware.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.680]   If you buy the iPad without a mobile contract, does it have GPS?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   Only the 3G model has GPS.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.880]   However, you can buy the 3G model without buying a contract.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.280]   It is always month to month.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.080]   You all understand is that if you're trying to save money on this, and try to buy something
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.240]   less expensive and get the functionality, what you give up is mobile aware of things,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.520]   geo aware of things.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   With the Hot Spot, otherwise you're kind of okay.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.840]   Yeah, GPS is missing from the Wi-Fi.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   Right.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.600]   That's the main thing you would give up.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   Right.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.000]   If you have it, just for the listeners.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.200]   If you have an iPhone, you go to Hot Spot, you get the cheaper iPad, you're okay except
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   for that.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   Precisely.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   Right.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.800]   The other thing I saw in Canada, Roger Eggs, Roger's just did a new plan in Canada when
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   I was up there a week ago that finally has the plan where you can do multiple SIMS, multiple
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.840]   devices under one data plan.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.880]   And finally, that makes up a perfect sense.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.000]   You pay 10 bucks a month more per device.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.200]   Who would think that Rogers was end up being an enlightened company?
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.360]   It's like the last company I wouldn't have thought so at all.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.760]   Having worked for them.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.800]   I want that so much.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   Right.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.160]   I want to be able to have and they should want me to want it.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:14.520]   I want five devices, six devices and not have to do another huge contract because they
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.720]   don't know what they're missing in terms of the things I won't buy because I'm not going
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.080]   to do a full $80 a month contract.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.880]   Makes it too expensive.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.040]   All right.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   Anything else to say?
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   I'm going to let Andy go because we're going to go to, there's a lot of other Gmail and
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.520]   Google search stuff to talk about.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   But anything else you'd like to say?
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.200]   I got one question for you, Rose, since I didn't watch the video.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.720]   How'd Steve look?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.680]   Steve looked great.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.600]   A lot of people, it was a big surprise.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.320]   He got a big hand from everybody in the room.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.560]   He looked no different than he did from previous appearances.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.640]   Also, I have to admit that when he left the stage for the video, I was saying, okay, now
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.360]   if you get a disappear disappear, but he was just standing by the side, standing just
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   off stage.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.640]   He did the whole thing just as always.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.840]   Did the whole thing standing up?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.760]   And by the end, he seemed just as strong and he was in good voice as he was at the very
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   beginning.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.920]   I know his doctor from a personal relationship, but then also saw him in Europe.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.840]   Of course, he's not going to say anything about Steve's particular case, but he wrote
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.160]   emails to some of these doctors who not knowing a damn thing about the case were speculating
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.520]   about it in the press.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   How dare you?
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   And everything that Steve's body has gone through God knows, but he, you know, what
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.840]   joke about him here and there, but he's our hero, man.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.000]   And I, you know, he got a standing ovation when he walked on stage and I have to say,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.280]   I would have been there standing up with everybody else.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   Yes.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.520]   What's your their, you know, no, he doesn't like me, but that's okay.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520]   I still like it.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.160]   Andy and I go, thank you so much for coming all this way to cover the event for us.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   We really appreciate it.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   Thanks for joining us on this week in Google.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   Good to see you, Andy.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   Thanks, Andy.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   Good to see you guys.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   All paper and we'll see.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   We'll see you.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.320]   To answer one question on Twitter, I'm not in the board.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   Hello.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   This is just very nice.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   Very nicely.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.360]   It's nicely decorated hotel lobby.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.520]   All San Francisco hotels look like board delos.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.680]   That's just the nature of the beast.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   Exactly.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   Take care.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.440]   Andy and Ico Chicago Sun times and the celestial waste of bandwidth C w O B dot com.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.760]   He was in there with the press covering the announcement.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:27.440]   We do have a if you want to watch the full analysis as we did it live this morning on
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.000]   Twitter, we that will be Mac break weekly, which should be out by now.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.920]   And you can download that and listen to that.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.560]   We didn't have that in stream this as they have the last two events, but we were able
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.160]   to talk along with the live blogging with somewhat Tom Merritt and I kind of likened
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.440]   it to the old days of radio where they would do baseball games via telegraph.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.880]   This just in the frustrating they didn't stream it.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.240]   I'd seem like it's backwards.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   It's crazy.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.560]   I have to say with the iPad, there were certain things I was disappointed about.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.640]   I'm sorry that there wasn't a recent retina display.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.080]   I'm sorry that wasn't a price drop.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.480]   And I'm sorry that I'm going to have to rebuy apps twice.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.360]   But then again, it's like if I have to buy Angry Birds twice, it's fine.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.400]   You don't have to rebuy it like the Android market.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.080]   Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.640]   You'd bought an iOS though you could bring over, but you don't have anything in iOS.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   Do you?
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.640]   Right.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.760]   But you've got to buy separate apps for the iPad versus the phone.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   Not necessarily.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.320]   It's a fact a surprising number of apps work on both.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.120]   Oh, they're just now compatible.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.160]   They do unit with is called universal.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.320]   And as time has gone by, I think more and more apps are universal.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   They sell.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   So we're going to take a break.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.800]   There is a lot to talk about Google changed their algorithm significantly, causing one
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.360]   major media company to fire 10% of its staff yesterday.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   We'll talk about that, the Gmail outage and more in just a bit.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.840]   You're watching Twig this week in Google with Gina Trapani, smarter where.org, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.480]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.840]   This show brought to you today by carbonite online backup.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.760]   You got to back it up to get it back and do it right with carbonite.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.160]   I can just make that the commercial.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   It all rhymes.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   It all goes together.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   It all makes sense.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   Why carbonite?
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160]   What do you think about it?
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.360]   It's very important.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.760]   Any backup solution that just doesn't happen automatically is not going to make it.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.480]   And it's not backing up to a local hard drive.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.480]   And why is that important?
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.680]   Well, what if, in fact, I encourage you to still make local backups use an external driver,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.880]   a USB key or CD-ROM or whatever, because it's convenient.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   But what if the worst happens?
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.320]   What if there's a fire, a flood, an earthquake and you lose everything?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.680]   Somebody breaks in, steals your computer and the external hard drive.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.160]   That's not a real backup.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.480]   Every backup expert I know says you got to have an offsite backup.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.960]   And that's what carbonite does.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.640]   Automatically, whenever you're connected to the internet, carbonite is trickling your
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   data up to the cloud where it's safe.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.800]   Not only in case of disaster, but you can access that data.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.080]   It's really offline access.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.320]   You can access that data anywhere, anytime from any system.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.680]   Just log on to your carbonite account.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   There's your data.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.360]   They even have a free iPhone and BlackBerry app.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.120]   So your data is always accessible and available.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.200]   So it's kind of like cloud storage in addition to backup.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.520]   And the price is right.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.240]   It's the last man standing on unlimited.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.840]   Fifty-five dollars a year gets you unlimited backup from one machine of the internal
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   drive on one machine, your personal data.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.800]   Obviously, it's not going to back up 800 external drives, but the internal drive on
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   your existing machine.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.360]   And it also uses your bandwidth.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.040]   So I do want you to try before you buy, make sure that you have sufficient bandwidth and
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.200]   the speed is adequate for you.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.080]   Sometimes I get emails from people saying, "You know, it's going to take me a week to
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.680]   back up my 300 gigabytes."
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.160]   It's like, "Well, dude, yes, it's my magic."
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.000]   Of course it is.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.240]   Because it's very gentle.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   It's humane.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   It doesn't tie your system up.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.760]   It doesn't tie your bandwidth up.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.760]   But it does.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.120]   Once you get that first backup done, that should take a week or so, then always up to
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   date.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   I love that.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Try it free for two weeks right now.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.400]   If you decide to buy, you'll get two additional months for free.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   Carbonite.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   Backup done right.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.680]   Don't come crying to me if you don't do it.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   Carbonite.com.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.560]   Speaking of backup, Gmail.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.760]   Now it's only point, they say only 0.02% of all Gmail users.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   But that was just--
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   There are a lot of Gmail users.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   That's tens of thousands of people.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.600]   And that's scary to happen to you.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.440]   Yeah, terrifying.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.000]   I would have panicked, for sure.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Gina, what happened?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   There was an outage?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   There was an outage.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.120]   So the official company story is they released software that had a bug that got disseminated
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   to their various Gmail servers before they caught it.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.080]   So the data, their hot backups, it ruined their hot backups basically.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.320]   They had to bring back the Gmail data from tape.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   From tape.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.520]   From tape, which is why it took so long for them to--
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.120]   Relatively, to get it back online.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   Yeah, scary stuff.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.320]   I mean, hey, this happens.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   Hugs happen.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.560]   But if you depend on your email and it's in the cloud, and this goes for every kind of
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.560]   cloud service, it's always kind of a good idea to have a little bit of a backup plan,
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.840]   just in case this kind of thing can happen.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.560]   I mean, kudos to Google for being transparent about it, for being communicative, for explaining
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.680]   what happened and explaining what they did to bring it back.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.880]   It makes me really happy that they have hot backup and cold storage.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.640]   So if thing went terribly wrong, they'd bring back my email.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   But if it was the middle of the week, and I had some really important email that I couldn't
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   get to, I'd be pretty freaked.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.000]   People are out for seven or eight hours.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.560]   There was no email at all.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.560]   Yeah, nothing was lost, but that's no email at all for seven or eight hours is a big deal.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   Right.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   This is kind of my Gmail nightmare.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.280]   My Gmail nightmare is actually trying to log in and being locked out and not being able
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.240]   to get to my stuff and being just one person with no voice.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.880]   I mean, this was an outage that affected a lot of people.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   People were going crazy talking about it.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   It got coverage.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   They communicated what was going on, that kind of thing.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.400]   Either way, if you're storing kind of mission critical information in the cloud, it's always
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.840]   a good idea to have a backup and a backup to Gmail.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.000]   So what's the best way to do that?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Is it backupify?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   What are the rules of the movie?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.640]   You can't even pretty throw a good article on Life Hacker here.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   Suggested.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   He did.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   There are several, several options.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   You can use something like backupify, which is an automated thing.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   That's what I use.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   Love it.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   Yeah, you pay for it.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   It's automated.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.880]   It just kind of does it in the background, set it, forget it.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.240]   You can do things like backup your Gmail to a hotmail account.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.160]   You kind of redundant cloud.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   That's fine.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   I mean, what are the chances of Google and Microsoft flopping at the same time?
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   Right, exactly.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   What are the chances?
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.880]   And then there's nerds like me.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.680]   I'm crazy.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.320]   I have once a month, I fire up Thunderbird and I pop all my Gmail from the previous month
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   and I have kind of a local--
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   That's a good idea.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.800]   But isn't a great solution because if it's the last day of the month, I still don't have
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.320]   a month's worth of email.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.240]   But I just like an idea that I have my backup and then it backs up to my backup service
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   and on my time machine drive.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.320]   It's your data.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.680]   And then it's searchable too.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.000]   I mean, it's kind of like you have the database of all of your emails.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.400]   I think that's a nice thing to do and it's free.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.000]   It will be smart for Google to make deal.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.200]   It doesn't say very good PR thing for them if they say, oh, you better back up on some
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   place.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.840]   But on the other hand, for all these services to say, listen, it's your data.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.160]   So here are some options for you.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   Here's how you're portable.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.200]   It would take away the, oh my God, they help my data and they've imprisoned me.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.360]   I think the IMAP and the pop access is that.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.520]   I think they couch it and like, hey, you can get it.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.960]   We can get us an, you get Gmail on any client, but you can also use it in backup.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   They've never kind of explained it as a backup.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.120]   Although Matt cuts back in '08, I think did a blog post like, hey, here's how to use
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.800]   FetchMail or another command line client to sort of schedule backups of via pop.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   So yeah.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.960]   FetchMail is also in that life.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.320]   Actually, you're the one who wrote the article on FetchMail.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.200]   I had written up the article on FetchMail, but then, you know, I gave up and I just went
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.520]   with Thunderbird because I was dealing with different PCs and Sigmund and all that madness.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.760]   So if you weren't on Windows, you could install FetchMail on your Mac or your Linux
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   box, right?
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   Right.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.760]   And you could cron a job that pulls it.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   That's what you want to do.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.160]   That would be a great way to do it.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.520]   Oh, but you have to have ProkMail, XM and FetchMail.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   Oh, boy.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.920]   Yeah, there's a lot to install.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   There's a lot to install.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.680]   There's a lot of nerdness happening there.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   And just lots to install and configure.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.280]   And my solution, which is to have to remember to bring up Thunderbird and pop my mail and
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.240]   bring up to any kind of local mail client, which is also not great, but I have just a
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.840]   recurring event on my calendar to do it.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.920]   Which makes me better.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.640]   Backup, I guess, is always the rule.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.880]   And the good news is Gmail followed the rule.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.200]   Google had backups.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   It just dropped for a while.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   Yes.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.800]   So backup isn't going to solve that fundamental issue of you're not in touch.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.600]   Not only should you have a backup, you should have a second email solution.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   Right.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.000]   You know, when you use Google Apps for your domain, I can move my email address to any
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.560]   service provider and it doesn't change.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:09.400]   If you're using vanilla Gmail then, but then again, Gmail gives you the option to send
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   from any address.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.800]   So here's what I would do.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.720]   In fact, what I do do.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.800]   I have Leo@leoville.com.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.320]   That's not a mail server.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.840]   That's my server and it uses an MX record to forward the mail first to Gmail.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.200]   But then I pop it from fast mail, which is an IMAP solution, and I actually use fast
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   mail as my connectivity.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.280]   So I have copies of everything on Gmail and fast mail.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.600]   If Gmail were to go down, it's just a simple change of a DNS record to say, "Oh, don't
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   send it to Gmail.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.800]   Send it right to fast mail."
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.120]   And I'm no worse off.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   So that's a way to do it.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   That's good redundancy.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   That's really good redundancy.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.640]   Because you have even more copies of the thousand emails a day that you can't answer.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   That I don't want.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.520]   But I'll never lose them.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.920]   Someday I may retire and you may get an email response from me like 30 years later.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.840]   20 years of my AgriSpan.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   I can't tell.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.120]   I could use that Viagra now.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.400]   You guys stealing bits?
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.840]   It would be funny if I started answering email.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.200]   Oh no, you got nipping at the joke out of my AgriJoke at the same show.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.080]   Why do you take this personally, Jeff?
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.480]   It would be funny if I started answering email 30 years later.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.880]   Hey, I got your email back in 2007.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.160]   What's like those great stories on TV?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.280]   They love the story where suddenly, "Mables email was lost in the past August for 16 years."
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.200]   Now this is the email equivalent of that.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.600]   It's the dead letter file, right?
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   Yeah, I like the idea.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   That'd be a really fun meme.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.080]   Go back to your Gmail, find a five-year-old email and just respond to it.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.200]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.120]   I did that by accident.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.440]   Yeah, I heard this on Twitch.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.360]   Didn't you have an email from your tech TV panel?
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   Share with your inbox.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.200]   Well, it was when I was setting up this Gmail fastmail thing.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.320]   You can go back in time and fetch all your Gmail and I did.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.120]   It was back 2006 or something.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   It was an early Twitch email.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   I didn't realize.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.120]   I didn't see the date and I thought this was a new email.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.440]   I responded to all.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.080]   I think it was just this weird strange dissonance for people that they were getting this email
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.720]   about a topic that they had discussed five years ago.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   I love it.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.400]   Yeah, it was kind of weird.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   It was dead lettery.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.120]   So we are going to talk about Google's new algorithm.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:34.480]   You know, poor Jason at Mahalo, he says he fired 10% of his staff because he's seen
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:42.640]   a dramatic drop in hits because Google has deprecated their content.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.240]   So he's the Mahalo is more human.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   They're not really doing media.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Yeah, they're not really a farm.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.920]   I don't think.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   So I don't think so.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.240]   So I guess back to Gina, what the hell happened here?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   What is this?
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.720]   There's a new algorithm.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:07.360]   So Google changes the algorithm to reduce, you know, lower quality content placement.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   That's a constant.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.720]   They're always doing that.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   They're always doing that, right?
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.760]   But it sounds like this algorithm change was especially targeted toward content farms.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.240]   However you define those.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.200]   Is it demand media or is it something else?
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   It's primarily demand.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.000]   Yeah, it's primarily demand.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.560]   That seems to be word on the street, right?
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   Right.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   But that's what Google said.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   It's not demand.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.200]   No, it's like these link farms.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.280]   It's just another form of link farm, right?
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   That too.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.760]   If you look at the list of who was affected, it was link farms and content farms.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.400]   Now, I saw that list and we had Cara Swisher here on Sunday on Twitter.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   She had just spoken to Yahoo, which bought the demand media company.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.840]   I can't remember their name.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840]   Associated content.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   Associated content.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   Associated content was on that list.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:58.320]   In fact, it was like number five of sites that were kind of pushed down.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.240]   And she says Yahoo denied it.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.320]   But in fact, they said, you won't, we won't really know for quite a bit longer whether
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.840]   it's impacted or not.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.360]   So did demand, but these were independent stats from elsewhere.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:16.800]   And I think that the, as we discussed, Google is not having a problem that the PR would,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.920]   negative PR would make us believe they have, nonetheless, the PR is a problem.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.880]   And they had to deal with this and it affects their reputation.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.920]   And so, I think there's a flight from crap that we've always had crap.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.040]   As I always say, the internet has always been filled with crap.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   That's not the issue.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.640]   The problem is finding the good stuff and Google in perception was getting less good at finding
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.160]   the good stuff.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.640]   And I'm interviewing Marissa Meyer and Tim Armstrong at CUNY next week for the start of
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.080]   hoops I just realized.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.640]   Yeah, I'll be on the show beforehand.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   Oh, good.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.640]   Oh, I wish you could go after.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.440]   We'd love to hear the results of that.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.520]   Well, it'll be a lot later.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   It'll be a lot later.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.440]   So I'll tell you and it starts at six o'clock.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.960]   So I have to be off on time.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.200]   But okay, we will get you off on time.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.960]   But what I want to question both about, especially after Armstrong's PowerPoint or the AOL way
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.280]   and Google doing this, is are we trying to improve the quality of the web?
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:19.440]   I think that what people tend to use more and more is Twitter and Facebook and peer links.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.960]   Oh, well, and that's what's hurting Google, right?
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.840]   They're using social search.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.800]   That's really the issue to me is that is the quality matters there, that they've got to
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.200]   find ways to improve that quality.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.520]   You're competing with curated search.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.600]   And in fact, by your social graph, I mean, that's pretty damn good.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.120]   I was Matt said on this very show really long before this argument came out.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   As he said here on Twig, that they were looking for signals of originality and quality.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.000]   And that, you know, what's the line between crap and spam?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.960]   Who said?
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.400]   The lines are really blurry, right?
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   That's the issue.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.280]   How do you define content form?
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.920]   But you know, how many people share links to Mahalo or Ihau to their front, like recommend
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   them to their friends.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.800]   You know, if I want to learn how to unplug my toilet, I'm probably going to get any how
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   article, right?
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   But are you going to like it on Facebook?
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Am I going to start on, right?
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.200]   Am I going to like it in reader?
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.240]   Am I going to start on, am I going to share it on Twitter?
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.440]   Am I going to post it to my blog?
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   Probably not.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.040]   No, but those, those, those links tend to be topical content, right?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.680]   Mostly.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.520]   So what about non topical content?
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.040]   Yeah, you don't share non topical content that much.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   Maybe you do.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   I don't know.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.840]   That's something it's newsy or of great interest, but it tends to be.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.120]   You know, when in fact, when I see on Hacker News or other places, articles that are several
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.480]   years old, like a what?
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.560]   Didn't you read it when it came out?
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.080]   What are you linking to it now for?
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   That's a good point.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.440]   But freshness is a signal, right?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   I mean, it is.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   It's a big part of the signal.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:55.000]   I think one of the key signals here that will make media companies happy is brand, right?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.440]   Right, because demand media is supposedly a bad brand.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   Right.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.320]   And so, you know, that's helpful.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.520]   If you look at YouTube, yeah, you can do the Mentos thing and you can make money on viral,
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:15.000]   but YouTube said this week that they're paying hundreds of people, six figures and thousands,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.680]   five figures a year on YouTube.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   That probably doesn't come from one video off at a time.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.160]   It probably comes from building a brand and having a following.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.000]   And so I think that that starts to matter here too, is that you want to, me, how had
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   a brand?
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.360]   I think I got a whirlwind where I got bought.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.520]   But that's one of the signals you have is this is a reliable home for good stuff.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   Right.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   Interesting.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.640]   Demand media's CEO says it didn't affect us.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   We're not journalists.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   We don't care.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.560]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.240]   This is Mike Shields writing an ad week this week.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.680]   Richard Rosenblatt, co-founder and CEO of Demand Media.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.120]   When he heard that Google was changing its algorithm with an intent to weed out content
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.240]   produced by companies like his, he didn't panic.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   He shrugged.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.680]   What else are you going to say?
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   Well, but...
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   Right.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   I mean, what else can you say?
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   That's what I was surprised by Jason.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   I mean, Jason...
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   Why did he jump on it?
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   I mean, he jumped on it.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   He reduced it, fired 10% of their staff.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.920]   I mean, that seems like an instant admission of kind of a failure.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.760]   I mean, you know, it's kind of like saying, like, yeah, our content didn't, it wasn't
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   up to snuff.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   Wasn't up to snuff enough for Google.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.800]   Jason Calicanis and Mahalo President Jason Rapson have amassed emailing, saying, among
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.840]   other things, that Google's changes have led to a significant dip in our traffic and
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.280]   revenue.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.680]   I wonder what there's not something else going on there is, is Jason wears the hair shirt
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   well?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.240]   And is he now going to say, big, bad Google is messing with me.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   I'm not like those guys.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.960]   And he over, you know, he quickly, he overreacted.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.000]   He's the king of overreaction.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.360]   He may in fact have just used this as an excuse to do something he needed or wanted to do.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.400]   I think it's that I think this now gives him the ability to act like he's poor, poor
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.000]   Jason and to act as if Google is the enemy of his business.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.200]   And he'll use this cynically and opportunistically.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.400]   Love you, Jason, but you know, it's what you do.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.600]   It's well, consider the source.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.120]   I think that's what you're saying.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.760]   We don't know, but consider the source.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   Right.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.960]   And it looks like a reason to switch to more video content to make to kind of pivot a little
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   bit, right?
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.800]   Man, media is probably is the number one contributor of video to YouTube.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.480]   Video is really what they do.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   He's Jason and Jason say, interesting, lady law, the search site of Google has impacted
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   us negatively.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.880]   Google's video unit YouTube continues to be our strong partner, encouraging us to ramp
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.760]   up our video production and publish even more of our expert video lessons.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   It's a pivot.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Gina, you're right.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   It's an opportunistic pivot.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   It's a pivot.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.760]   That's what it sounds like it could be.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:48.560]   I wonder if Google uses the data that they gather through Google Analytics to check to
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.720]   see kind of how these algorithms change.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.080]   It's interesting, you know, because Google knows how a lot of these sites do and their
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   own search results because of you.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   Wouldn't that be so?
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.800]   Well, a breach of confidentiality, if there, one hand is saying, we know a lot of stuff
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.480]   about these sites you want to share that with Matt here.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   I hope to know.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.880]   But you don't need to use analytics.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   They can use the AdSense.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.280]   A lot of these sites are serving Google Ads and Google knows everything about Google
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.280]   Ads.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.680]   Well, even then, I don't think they should be using that, should they?
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.760]   Well, why not?
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.280]   Because in the sense that they need to know where ads perform.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.640]   Well, because if it got out, then people would say, I'm not going to use AdSense.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.880]   I'll be a partner with somebody else.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.520]   I don't want to have my search results deprecated because of information.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.880]   Google is gleaned from us being a customer.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.880]   That's a boy.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   That's not so good.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   Yeah, it's a good.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.480]   I'm sure it has to be addressed somewhere in the analytics terms of use.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   It's just interesting to me that they do both website traffic reporting and it has such
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.280]   a big impact on what those numbers have been.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.240]   If they were to combine all these different information sources, they would absolutely
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.080]   know everything they need to know.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.440]   Maybe they have never said that they don't.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.200]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.600]   It would certainly make people stop using analytics in AdSense if they knew that.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600]   Do you think?
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.920]   What kind of channel conflicts you get now is a channel conflict.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.320]   Well, how do you handle that as a company?
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.760]   Don't you build a firewall Chinese wall?
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   Right.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.240]   That's how you have to get at this point.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:23.400]   Google Analytics is the days of Web-alizer and what was that other really bad?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.280]   Google Analytics is so good.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.520]   They bought an urchin.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.800]   And urchin was very good.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.440]   They bought it and incorporated it.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.960]   But there are other goods.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.640]   I think Quantcast is actually better.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.880]   Don't you?
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.640]   I mean, those are numbers you can sell.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   I don't think-
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.040]   Yeah, and that's in fact what I'm pretty sure the Gawker uses Quantcast now.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.240]   But Quantcast, I'm not sure how it works.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   I mean, it's not-
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   Same thing.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   Do you know that a JavaScript bug?
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Same thing.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   Same exact thing as analytics.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   Right.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   Right.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   It's not like a tool bar or an estimation.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   No, no, no, no, no, like Alexa or something.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   That makes me not so.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   Those are useless.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.840]   No, it has to be direct measurement of visits.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   Right.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.520]   Speaking of which, at some point I want to talk to you about hash bangs in the URLs.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.440]   Have you been following this discussion?
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.640]   I mean, only in so far as-
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.840]   You have to recuse yourself because Gawker is a big hash bang user.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.440]   Yeah, they're a big hash bang user.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.160]   And it's making me crazy because I'm editing the life hacker book right now and all the
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.240]   URLs in the book actually have the hash bang.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.440]   And it sort of offends my sense of your well-ness.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.240]   I think this is the show to talk about it.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   But I don't want you to feel a conflict.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.040]   We could use Twitter uses it to anybody who uses a lot of Ajax's using it.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   GitHub uses it.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   Yep.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   Yep.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   GitHub uses it.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   Good.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   GitHub apparently uses it intelligently though.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Okay.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   Like they use it in issues for sure in the issue tracker, but maybe not in other places.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   Well, we'll talk about that.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.480]   There's a new Google profile search.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.040]   I hope it makes profiles more usable, not less.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.240]   I'm a little worried that it's separate from Google itself, but we'll talk about that.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.240]   And a lot more you're watching this week in Google, Google in the cloud with Jeff Jarvis,
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.760]   Gina Tripani brought to you today by Squarespace.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.760]   Great.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.720]   Now, speaking of clouds, this is a cloud application for your website.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:15.440]   I guess all websites are cloud applications, but the software for Squarespace and the hosting
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.880]   for Squarespace are both from Squarespace.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.640]   And there's an advantage to doing it that way because it's always up to date.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.920]   You don't have to even think about that.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.320]   That's just part of the deal as it comes up to date.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.920]   They have such control of the situation that they can throw more bandwidth at you.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.520]   They've got very sophisticated Java-based virtual hosting and so forth.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.000]   It's just really nicely done.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   These guys at Dane and Anthony wrote this in college as a solution for themselves.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.720]   And now, of course, years later, it's become a many agree, the best solution for a website
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.000]   for a content management system.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.160]   I want you to try it for free.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.080]   If you go to squarespace.com/twig, it's very easy.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.200]   There's no credit card needed.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.760]   You name the site, you give it a password, an email address, in case you forget the password.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.360]   I like you don't even have to type the password twice.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   I love that.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.640]   And a little capture here.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.080]   And now for two weeks, you've got the full benefit of Squarespace, the 60 plus designer
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.600]   templates that are so easy to configure with your sliders and drag and drop.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   Of course, if you're a CSS wizard or JavaScript wizard, you always, you could do with the hash
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.760]   bangs.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.320]   You could do anything you need.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.040]   It's all in there.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.560]   That's the beauty of this.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:29.400]   Squarespace.com/twig, a great iPhone and iPad app, make it easy to not only post content,
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.360]   but to moderate comments, complete integration with your social media network, importing
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   and exporting.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.200]   You're never trapped from the major blog APIs, including movable type wordpress, typepad
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   and blogger.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.640]   They've got photo galleries, forums, just everything you'd want in a simple point and
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.560]   click environment that makes you look like a web pro.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   Just take a look at the examples who get some idea.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:01.480]   This is what big businesses are using, individuals for their blogs, charities, anybody who needs
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.120]   a website and you really need a website.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   Trust me.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.760]   Don't trust your presence on the web to Facebook.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   That'd be a mistake.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   Here's Kevin Pollack's site.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   Here's our site there.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.240]   Twit blog is a Squarespace site.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.600]   And look how fast that pops up.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   Squarespace.com/twig.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.040]   Give it a try today.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.000]   You will love it.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   So I don't know.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Should we get in this hashbang thing?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.240]   Do you know, or is that really the weeds?
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.920]   No, we absolutely can.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.520]   I mean, I'm fine with it.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   It's crazy.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   I'm actually reading a couple of--
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   There's some good blog.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   Yeah, there's some good blog posts.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.520]   There's a good blog.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.520]   Oh, Tim Brake.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   Kind of weighed in.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.520]   A few few designers.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.640]   Listen, the reality is that URLs should point to a piece of content.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.600]   And hashbang URLs depend on JavaScript to fetch content, to load inside, which is what
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   the Gawker sites do.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   Gawker is a company I worked out for five years.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   I own the stock there.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.000]   That doesn't mean that I can't criticize them a little bit.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   It's weird.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   It drives me a little crazy.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I think they're crazy.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   I have not looked at their Google Analytics on a really long time.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   So I'm not sure how it affected their--
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.320]   Google's apparently got a way around it.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.120]   But it's kind of a clue-g way around it.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.040]   I mean, I don't understand why you wouldn't just-- if you're a content publisher, why
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.920]   are you URL wouldn't just be a regular string with the words of your headline in it, which
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.960]   is what life hacker and the other Gawker sites you're all used to be.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   I mean, that just seems like good--
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   That's what I think.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   --for Mac.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   It's just straightforward.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   HDV.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   I think it was Twitter that started this.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.640]   So if I go to twitter.com/genitorpony, what's what happens?
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:34.720]   It transforms itself to the hashbang, twitter.com/poundsignexclamation.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.320]   That's called a hashbang/genitor.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.880]   Hashbangification of the web.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.680]   Well, it's really like the web appification of the web, right?
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Right.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.560]   The web app came started when they did the new Twitter redesign, right?
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.560]   Which is very like iPad web app-y-like, right?
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.160]   You tap and that side panel flies out.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.920]   It's much more kind of Ajax-y.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   But you could do this in HTML5 without a hashbang with real URLs.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.440]   That's the-- I guess the-- what it is, I think it's mostly node.js that people are
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   using.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.800]   Everybody loves node.js.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.080]   Developers love it.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:15.640]   So what it means is when you go to twitter.com, the browser actually doesn't get Gina Trapani's
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   content.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:22.040]   It gets a big-ass chunk of JavaScript, which it runs locally on your machine, and that
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.520]   generates the page.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.200]   Get fetching bits of-- these are all different bits of content.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.000]   So there is no twitter.com/genitorpony.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   It doesn't exist.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.120]   And that's what part of the difficulty with Google is.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.360]   There's no page for them to index, and Google spiders don't run JavaScript.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360]   So there's a kind of--
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.520]   Doesn't that hurt-- doesn't that hurt Gawker at some point?
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.360]   You'd think, but Google does apparently some sort of workaround that makes it possible.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.480]   I mean, from a developer point of view, it's attractive, right?
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.440]   Because it's this separation of content and presentation that you're getting.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.400]   I assume that it's JSON or XML, probably most likely JSON.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.560]   And then showing itself.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.840]   And I'm actually-- I really haven't counted this, so I'm not sure what Google's doing
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.200]   to see those pages.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:11.680]   It seems strange that you'd want to depend on a Google's kind of workaround.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.200]   It's very inside baseball.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.640]   But if you have lately noticed-- for instance, not unusual for me to go to Twitter and get
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.800]   a blank page, that's because something's gone wrong.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.640]   I've got the chunk of JavaScript, and it didn't-- or whatever.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.920]   But Facebook, and that was to be all the time.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.080]   Facebook's same.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.200]   It's using hash bangs as well.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.120]   And so there is a side effect and reliability and performance.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.000]   There's definitely a side effect in indexing.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.240]   And URLs no longer really refer to content.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.200]   Well, here's the other thing I think.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:44.760]   MSNBC has said that they're going away from page views, pages.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   Right.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   Everybody is.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.080]   The web app, as you said, the web app of amplification.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   Right.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   So it's a window.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.240]   It's a TV screen.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   It's a whatever.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.360]   And stuff just comes onto it.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.040]   And that's where we go.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.560]   And that's OK.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.160]   But so much of the architecture of how we do the web, including
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.800]   the commerce of the web and things like that,
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.240]   is based on pages.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.440]   Should it be?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.680]   That's a different question.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.240]   So I just want--
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.440]   You don't have to just push too.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.040]   That you want to be able to push content
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.240]   and get the autorefreshing.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.640]   Someone in the chat room helpfully
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.080]   gave me the link to making Ajax applications crawlable.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.400]   Is if you Google that, that's the document for how Google works
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:23.880]   around this.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.440]   But you basically instruct the Google bot.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.480]   This is an Ajax application.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.320]   And here's how to get the content, which
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.520]   makes sense.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.160]   But yes, the URL is driving crazy.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.000]   I'm not a big fan of the hash bang.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.320]   Well, I just started discovering this whole discussion
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.400]   about this on the web.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.200]   And I thought--
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.880]   well, I thought I'd like to bring it up
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.080]   and just raise people's awareness of it
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.320]   and probably two inside baseball for us to discuss.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.680]   Nevertheless, I think fascinating.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.600]   And maybe at another time, we need a web developer show
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.320]   so we could talk about stuff like this.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:10.080]   I would point people to Chris Schiflet's blog, which is H-S-H-A-S-H-I-F-L-E-T-T.org.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.160]   And he has a good article on this linking
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:19.280]   to all of the big articles, including Tim Bray's article
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:19.960]   about this.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:25.840]   And it basically violates Postel's law, which
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.840]   is be conservative in what you give and liberal
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.200]   and what you accept.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.720]   And fascinating.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.480]   I think it's fascinating, but enough of that.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.920]   What about this new profile search?
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.160]   So Google has a profile search engine?
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.880]   Yeah, so Google operating system uncovered this,
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.760]   which is a great blog for all sorts of Google product tips.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.240]   They found that there's a way to search Google profiles
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.320]   if you add a URL parameter.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.400]   So the profile search isn't exposed in Google's interface
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.440]   right now, but likely it will be.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   This is usually how they start to roll these things out.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   If you add-- so what is the--
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:07.360]   The query is so you go to google.com/profile/u/zero question
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.120]   mark, and then the query is specified by q=in the query.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.840]   For instance, if I do q=leo, I'll find all the profiles
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.880]   of people with the name Leo, including mine at the top there.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.200]   So it's a people search.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.280]   It's a meaning of another kind of--
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.560]   What happened to Google me?
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.800]   Is this part of Google me?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.480]   Yeah, I'm not really sure what's going on with Google me.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.880]   It's as fabled as HTML5 taking over the world.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.560]   It's like Duke Nukem Forever.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.920]   It's just-- it's imaginary.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.000]   Right, I mean, I think from what I understand--
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.840]   and the last I heard about it is Google me
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.280]   is just it's not really a single standalone Google
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.080]   me product.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:54.920]   It's just these slow and steady social improvements.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.160]   Right, like this, like disability and such profiles.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.080]   Right, right.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.560]   But I think it goes back to identity.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.760]   I think I don't know if we're going to talk about this separately.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   But Facebook's comment, distributed comment structure,
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.240]   to the discuss.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.200]   I love discuss.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:11.680]   I use this--
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.320]   Architecture.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.040]   Right.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   Is Facebook using discuss now?
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.320]   Facebook's competing with discuss.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.400]   Oh, are they?
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   Yeah, you can do it now.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:19.840]   What you can do now?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.400]   Facebook comments.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.720]   Never!
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.760]   Yes, which means that when you go to the site,
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.160]   you can see just the comments of your friends.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.640]   They are prioritized differently.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.480]   You can-- they now make supportability
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.000]   that you can put them on Facebook
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.040]   and share your comments somewhere else, which is kind of nice.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.960]   Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, so what that means
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.440]   is Facebook steps closer to being the identity
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.360]   structure of the web.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.760]   Which they've always wanted.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.920]   They've always wanted to be.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.760]   And I've argued that there's some danger there
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   because you've got to know what's happening with what you do out
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.520]   on the web and how it relates to what happens inside Facebook.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.840]   But having said that, they're just comments.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.760]   Right.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.960]   And if you're putting them out on the open web,
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.920]   they're on the open web.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.760]   So now you can have a new ability
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.080]   to not only sign in with Facebook,
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.680]   but share via Facebook.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.000]   And I think most importantly, get
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.360]   the social benefits of comments.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   So it means you can see only people
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.280]   who sign up with Facebook and have real identities, which
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.680]   presumably will improve the civility of the comments, which
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.200]   is the big issue with comments.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.080]   And you can also get the social value
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.760]   so that you see comments prioritized for you
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.440]   if I got all this right.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.560]   That's a big deal.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.400]   And that beats search and profile pages.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.880]   Right.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.360]   It does.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.040]   And basically, as a publisher, you give up your ability
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.680]   to host the conversations about your own content
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   and your own database for all the sort of sticky social things
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.600]   that Facebook offers, which is--
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:43.880]   Right.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.320]   If I could do it now, it's discussed, which is great.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.480]   But this now adds things to it that poor disgust can't do
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.840]   because it's not Facebook.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.680]   Right.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.480]   Yeah, I use a similar system, JSKitsEcho,
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.960]   which does the same thing.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.240]   It pulls in from Facebook and all the others.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.080]   But boy, when Facebook does it, the problem is,
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.640]   Facebook's not going to support all the other stuff.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.320]   It's going to be Facebook, right?
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.120]   Like, discuss and JSKitsEcho will give you Twitter.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:14.200]   So it's great because if you write a blog post, tweet it.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.800]   All the comments from Twitter are pulled in.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.280]   All the comments for Facebook are pulled in.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.800]   I love that.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.080]   Right.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.680]   And that's the thing, right?
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.600]   That's the thing.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.520]   That's going to differentiate.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.880]   And anyone else is offering from Facebook's.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.960]   Right.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   Here's the-- if you go to Inside Facebook, for example,
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.880]   or SB Nation, you'll see it in operation.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.520]   So inside Facebook.com, and then go to a post there
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.560]   at the bottom, it just says, "Leaver Reply."
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.280]   And it's a Facebook box.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   It's so familiar.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:47.600]   There it is.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.120]   It's Facebook.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:48.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.960]   It's out of comment.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.880]   As a dumb developer, my first reaction was, why would any publisher
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.560]   do this?
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.360]   Oh, I could tell you why.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:56.880]   But--
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.880]   --Jared Jives Traffic.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.840]   Jives Traffic.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.920]   Yeah, you can write traffic back.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.480]   So where is it that I do this?
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.000]   Go down.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.480]   Go down, Leo.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.400]   Blow the ads.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.680]   Oh, there it is.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.360]   Oh, look, there's my Facebook picture.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.440]   It knows me.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   You're logged in.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.040]   Oh, crap.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.880]   Now, if I add a comment, does that also go in my--
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.280]   yeah, it's supposed to fix the option.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.280]   But that's why they do it.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.960]   Because then my Facebook friend see my comment.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.480]   Maybe you're driven back to this page.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.240]   It drives traffic.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.440]   And we know the like button drives huge amounts of traffic.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:27.960]   Right.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.360]   So they--
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.120]   Yeah, you know, I'm one of the ones who made fun of like.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.280]   And said, oh, who was that?
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.720]   That's going to, you know, spook on me the way I'm running
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.080]   the web.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.800]   No, I was wrong.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.520]   So now they've got the like button.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.360]   They've got the activity feed plugin.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   They've got recommendations, the like box, the login button,
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.080]   the registration button, the face pile button, the comments
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.400]   button, and the live stream.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.840]   Well, here's the really important thing, Gene.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.280]   There was the why else publishers would do it.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.120]   Is that one of the huge problems,
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.000]   it's a big cost for publishers to have to manage comments.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.440]   And this kind of handles spam automatically, right?
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.440]   Because--
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.120]   Well, like that.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.280]   But also, you have to have an identity.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.240]   I mean, Facebook's bloodstream.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.400]   You know, they wouldn't even change their rules for while
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.280]   going to aim from Google when they had the fake identity
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.080]   to do the page.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.800]   And they had to find somebody else who
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.880]   was sympathetic to the cause to have them be the host of it.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.520]   Because Google--
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.280]   But Facebook is not going to get off the real identity,
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.760]   nor should they, I think.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   Get off Facebook.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.040]   That's what they are.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.280]   And that has-- so that brings value back to the publisher
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.800]   in terms of improving the civility and reducing the cost
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.760]   and improving the engagement people have with their site.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   It's brilliant.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.680]   Brilliant.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.200]   Right.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:38.700]   Right.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.360]   But can publishers export or get access to all the comments
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.200]   specifically related to their content?
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.520]   You don't want to hold on, Gina.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.760]   Why would they?
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.880]   In 10 years, has publishers done anything with their comments?
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.560]   Well, but they should be, right?
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.120]   This is a community who's saying things about what they're doing.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.440]   Like, what's the point of having a community
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.200]   if you're not going to do anything with the conversations
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.400]   that they're having around your stuff?
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.080]   I don't think anyone is doing it.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.280]   So it really is a question then of why you do comments,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.360]   why you do community, is it to drive more traffic
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.400]   to get more engagement?
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.520]   Or is it because you care what people say?
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.720]   And I would guess in many cases, it's the former.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.240]   You don't really care what people are saying.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.080]   You just want--
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.720]   You should care what people say.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.000]   That's Gina.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.800]   You care about your community.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.600]   You care about yourself.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.560]   You're sold fashion.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.520]   Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.600]   No, I agree with you 100%.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.040]   That's the only way in the long run.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.360]   Perhaps they're right, but they don't.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.160]   This is different from Tina.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.440]   10 years of the comments.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.480]   I dealt with comments all the time, and we were publishers.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.560]   And I lectured them and told them to do comments and all that.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.440]   And I hate them.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.480]   They hate comments.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.040]   But this is the difference between the debags
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.200]   and the people who care about the web.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.760]   Well, guess what?
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.200]   The debags are here, baby.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.240]   No, they totally are.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.080]   I think they shouldn't bed Facebook comments.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.680]   I think everyone else should maybe also
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.120]   but also be worried about ways or be concerned about ways
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.240]   to get that data and do something more with that data
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.800]   to respond to their community and figure out
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.640]   how to engage people a little more.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.120]   You know, I've resisted putting like buttons
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.640]   and tweet buttons on our content.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.160]   You need to.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.960]   Stupidly, foolishly, for that very reason, Gina.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.560]   I don't want the Facebook bookification of the internet.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.640]   But of course--
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.000]   I'm into the like.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.480]   I know.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.400]   I'm some.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.960]   And I'm doing my Zuckerberg image.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.440]   Doing so, I'm actually hurting you guys.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.280]   He's hurting me now.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.200]   He's stuck.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.680]   I think he's stuck.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.520]   Because that's--
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.880]   This is where we are now.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.920]   And Gina, another view I have of comments
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.640]   is that I was always religious about how
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.480]   sight-shin of comments.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.200]   This relationship is blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.960]   And I came to see that I was wrong to this extent.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.560]   Comments by their very architecture in content, at least.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.480]   Say to the public, we don't want to hear from you
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.240]   until after we're done.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.880]   And after we're done, we will dain to allow you
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.320]   to comment on our work.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.600]   And you know what?
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.960]   We're going to go to the bar.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.400]   We don't care what you have to say.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.480]   We're going to come back.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.880]   And we're going to see all the broken class of all this.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.000]   And we're going to say, see the people are bozos.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.960]   Whereas true collaboration means you move people up the chain.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.880]   You collaborate much earlier in the process.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.520]   And you say, what should I be doing today?
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.440]   What do you want me to do?
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.320]   What do you want to know?
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.920]   What do you know?
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.400]   Yes.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.600]   Let's work together.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.200]   All of that.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.960]   That does not happen out of comments.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.640]   That's going to happen in other structures and other ways
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.880]   that you do things collaboratively together.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.920]   So the spirit of collaboration, I think that that got kind of--
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.360]   even though you're in collaboration, the idea
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.480]   that a relationship was formed was formed badly in comments.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.240]   And I blamed publishers for doing that.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.880]   And I'm not sure that I fully should have.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.440]   I certainly should, to some extent.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.960]   But I think, again, the architecture of comments is wrong.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.920]   I agree with you.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.160]   I totally agree with that after the fact point that you just made.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.480]   But I do think that Twitter and Facebook are places
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.240]   where you can ask before you write the story, respond to people
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.960]   during the writing of the story, post the story,
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.840]   and then collect the comments after the story.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.120]   And yes, that there's the one writer.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.960]   But you still have the community engaged around.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.120]   And I've done this.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.080]   And we do it on LifeHagger.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.920]   I just-- I feel like this whole-- I don't know.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.120]   When you treat your community just like eyeballs
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.920]   and not like humans who are part of the collaboration--
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.720]   Well, you don't--
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.960]   I think it's another way to look at this.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.480]   Another way to look at this is--
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.640]   I have never said this before.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.400]   I'll regret this in 10 minutes.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   I almost wonder whether you kill comments.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.440]   It's the kind of thing Nick--
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.280]   I have.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.440]   And on some of our content, I don't do content.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.560]   And the problem is, I condemned that before.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.280]   I said that was chicken, and you're not investing
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.520]   in the community, you're not doing this,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.600]   and you're not doing that.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.320]   Well, maybe there are now better tools to truly interact.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.800]   Right.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.600]   Like IRC.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.440]   And like maybe Facebook, and certainly like Twitter.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.360]   Yep.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.080]   Twitter is a wonderful-- We have good satisfaction.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.160]   I just don't want to have comments right under the shows
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.400]   because there were all these trolls who would say bad things
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.360]   about the shows.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.840]   And then I felt like people would go to the shows
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.080]   and see the bad comments and never listen.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.920]   So I've moved them elsewhere, in effect.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.560]   Right.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.060]   Right.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.680]   I mean, listen, this is why I love Wave so much, right?
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.360]   Because Wave was all about collaboration
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.560]   from start to finish.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.160]   If all users were part-- as much part of the community--
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.680]   that wouldn't be so bad.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.560]   But there's not just debug content creators.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.240]   There's debug users, too.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:35.880]   Absolutely.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.280]   Yep.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.960]   Yep.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.720]   Well, that's the other problem, is that not to get way
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.320]   high of the altitude and low in the oxygen.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.840]   What I say to people is that we in media
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.000]   god-like in our own image see the internet as a medium.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.880]   And so we think that when people leave nasty comments,
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.920]   they've schmutshed it all and ruined it.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.560]   And it's not.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.080]   It's the streets of New York.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.580]   Right.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.120]   There are bozos in the streets of New York.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.440]   The internet is life.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.600]   Ergo, there are going to be bozos in the internet.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.240]   And you just have to realize that and work with that
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.760]   and put the investment in to have the right interactions
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.440]   at the right time with people in ways that truly matter
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.280]   and give them respect.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.240]   And speaking for big media companies,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.680]   it can be challenging because if you have a large audience,
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.000]   it's not trivial to interact.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:18.640]   It's expensive.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.920]   It's very expensive.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.640]   There are companies-- there's one called LiveNation,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.920]   or Live World, that has been doing this for years
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.680]   of having people police the comments
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.760]   that you have to invest.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.360]   Because if you don't, you're showing no respect
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.160]   to the community either.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.000]   If you don't get rid of the bozos.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.760]   Right.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.760]   But this is the thing.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.720]   But when you have a business that's
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.040]   based around making content, it's not about hiring police.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.960]   You have to change your whole--
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.400]   your business is having a conversation
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.960]   and engaging in community of people on the web.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.320]   When you're on the web, you're about communicating with people.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.720]   You're not about publishing articles.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.840]   So I totally see your point, Jeff, about comments
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.400]   after the fact being sort of useless.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.800]   And maybe we can just get them to Facebook,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.960]   because they are sort of useless,
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.160]   because there is someone just from on high posting,
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.560]   and then they have to hire all these people
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.640]   to delete the trolls.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.720]   But you can't look at it that way.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.880]   I mean, the publications that are going to win,
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.560]   the publications that are about having conversations
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.480]   with their readers and engaging in the world the whole way.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.360]   You are preaching to the choir, Reverend Gina.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:15.840]   Absolutely.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.720]   Yeah, totally.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.960]   You absolutely agree.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.400]   But in practicality, what happens
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.840]   is when I was running local sites,
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.400]   nj.com and organlab.com and all those,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.000]   and we had the comments, we had the problems you have,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.160]   I thought that what we needed was every forum.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.280]   That goes down as it was forums, not comments,
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.760]   way back in the day.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.560]   And I thought we needed to hire moderators.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.960]   We hired moderators, right?
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.720]   And it didn't work.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.880]   And then I hired this really good social guy,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.080]   and he said, "No, Jarvis, you're all wrong here."
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.640]   That's like saying that you want the mayor
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.280]   who should be kissing babies to be out there cleaning up the garbage.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.000]   You need to...
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.080]   There are people who are going to come in
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.880]   who are just going to schmutz the space,
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.960]   and you got to deal with that.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.480]   If you don't invest in that and deal with that,
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.960]   then everybody's going to hate you for it.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.560]   You got to do that.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.080]   You have to have a cleanup crew for the bozos.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:04.720]   That's not your...
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.200]   The heart of your interaction with your public.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:07.600]   Right.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.440]   That's an obligation that comes
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.800]   so you can have good interaction with your public,
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.400]   because you can't just assume that the bozos
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.920]   will disappear on their own.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   That's what that is.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   Right.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.440]   Right.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.480]   That makes sense.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:18.880]   I'm with you.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.680]   They're different functions.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   They're functions.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.000]   Right.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.600]   So back to Facebook.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.320]   So Facebook by having real identity
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.440]   and having the ability as a user to prioritize my friends.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.720]   If I'm in a place like Confident or Espidation,
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.360]   if I were a Knicks fan in there,
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.080]   then I could see my friends,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.560]   and that takes care of a lot of that function.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:39.720]   Right.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.800]   So Facebook gives you the facility
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.120]   with the cleaning crew built in.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.160]   To some extent.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.880]   So it turns it around.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.000]   Rather than cleaning, it nearly...
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.120]   Okay, let's metaphor time.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.520]   You know, it brings you to the room with your friends in it.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:54.920]   Automatically.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.760]   It's Clay Shurkeys filter failure.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   It's Clay Shurkeys filter.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.440]   Rather than playing whack-a-mole with the bad people,
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.320]   what you do is you promote the good.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.280]   Which is a better model, I think.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.120]   Right.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Right.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.720]   So that's why we're all going to have Facebook comments
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   on our pages.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.520]   Yes, we are.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.320]   Damn it.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.320]   Go ahead and smash the clock.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.200]   I'm going to set this up by a vlog right after.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:15.720]   Damn it.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.480]   I'll put Facebook.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   You know what?
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.760]   As an experiment, we should try that on the Twitter page,
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.040]   because that's the place I turned off comments.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.960]   I have comments on my blog everywhere else.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.920]   But on the Twitter page, maybe I'll turn them on
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.640]   and see what happens.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.560]   Why am I going to regret that?
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.680]   We got to take a...
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.520]   Okay, here's...
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.760]   One second.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.000]   The press release I got from David Swain at Facebook.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:38.800]   Four publishers.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.080]   Easy to implement distribution,
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.520]   moderation controls,
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.360]   higher engagement.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:43.760]   Yes.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.760]   Four users.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.040]   Authentic, commenting, and social context.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.040]   See the best of comments first.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   Moderation and spam control.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   Take the conversation farther.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   Threaded comments.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:54.640]   Yep.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.320]   And comment as page.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.920]   That's pretty compelling.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.360]   Page owners can comment on external sites
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.120]   as their Facebook page.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.040]   Oh, I think we're in that.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.280]   You're logged in the Facebook.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.720]   You'll see the option to comment as your page.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.800]   The comment will be shared on your page's wall.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.680]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.480]   So that's what they built here.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.560]   Rather quietly.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.080]   I think...
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.040]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.880]   It's very compelling.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.400]   In fact, it's exactly what I want.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.160]   And I'll probably turn it on this afternoon
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.560]   on the Twitter TV page.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.840]   The oh, if Gina can buy an iPad,
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   you can use Facebook.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.200]   I know, this is just...
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.360]   This is this whole episode.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.760]   It's just gonna turn codes.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   God.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.920]   We have to take a break and get our tool tip
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.360]   a number of the week before we do though.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.120]   A couple of quick hits.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.400]   First of all, apparently Facebook raises self-esteem
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   in a study, 63 students who looked at Facebook,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.360]   a mirror, or nothing for three minutes.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.160]   The Facebook group was only allowed to surf
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.280]   their pages and tabs, not their friends after each student
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.760]   took a self-esteem questionnaire.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.960]   Those who study, Sir Facebook,
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.280]   reported having higher self-esteem.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:01.320]   Those who stared at nothing or the mirror.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.640]   No change.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   How clever am I?
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.280]   It's the witch, isn't it?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.800]   Ha ha!
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   And...
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.600]   And who's the coolest of them all?
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.880]   The honeycomb statue has arrived at the lawn on Google.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.600]   Google's campus, that means honeycomb is coming soon.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.280]   This is a good one.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.240]   It is, but I wonder, is the bee gonna kill
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.480]   the poor little android guy?
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.080]   He does look a little terrified.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.400]   It looks a little menacing.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.680]   (grunting)
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.360]   I thought it was interesting that Steve Jobs
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.760]   in the iPad launch today
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.600]   used that bee to stand in for honeycomb
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.240]   in all of his critiques of android.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.120]   I thought that was kind of...
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.160]   I mean, boy, Apple's not slow to pick up on semiotics.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.920]   They see the bee is threatening too.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.520]   We're gonna take a break, come back in just a second.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.200]   Is there any other quick things we wanna get in here?
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.480]   There's so much stuff.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.920]   Have you updated Gingerbreaded?
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Have you gotten it yet, Gina?
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.760]   Yes, I have.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.600]   I did not wait for them to be able to--
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.680]   You did it manually.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.840]   I did the manual.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.000]   As soon as I heard it was the official zip file,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.840]   I did it manually.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.680]   I couldn't stop myself.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.520]   And I like it.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.000]   It's nice.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.880]   It's darker, smoother.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.320]   There's an anything that's like stand out
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.600]   marquee about it that I'm like,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.200]   kind of reheels for, but it's definitely a nice,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.160]   a nice little upgrade.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.840]   You're just happy about that.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.640]   Yeah, finally, finally.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.160]   And you can be reassured there will be, in fact,
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.000]   no Charlie Sheen talk today.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.480]   (laughing)
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.160]   On the other hand, we might mention the Oscars, I don't know.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.880]   Were you happy, Sad?
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.120]   About the Oscars or about Sheen?
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.280]   Sad about Sheen.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.120]   No, I--
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:39.960]   Who's your new talk about the Oscars?
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.800]   No, we can find the--
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.800]   We can say who's winning.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.840]   (laughing)
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.240]   My face is melting.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.960]   All right, let's take a break, come back with more.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.680]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, this week in Google Tech News
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.520]   today coming up in just a moment before we go there.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.600]   I wanna mention freshbooks.com, a great way
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.960]   if you're a freelancer or small business person
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.920]   or sole proprietor to do your invoicing.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.800]   It's always a hassle.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.600]   It's the thing I hated doing so much
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.640]   'til I found fresh books back in 2004.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.120]   That's when I started using them.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.960]   It's a website that lets you do your invoicing
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.200]   on the web, but it makes it easier for you to get paid
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.120]   and I kinda like that notion.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.640]   If you go to freshbooks.com, you'll see
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   you can sign up for free for up to three clients
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.760]   so it's a good way to get started.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.120]   If you want paper invoices sent,
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.560]   they will do it for an additional fee.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.160]   Your logo goes on the invoice.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.640]   But once you send out an invoice via email,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.600]   your clients can pay you via credit card, PayPal,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.760]   or 11 other electronic payment services.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.160]   That just means you get paid faster and easier.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.640]   They will also do things like tickle you
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.520]   when you haven't gotten paid automatically.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.680]   Automated late payment reminders.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.880]   If you invoice by the hour,
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.880]   if you do time tracking and billing,
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.800]   you can log your hours, they have an iPhone app
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.360]   or on the web and then consolidate those time sheets
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.640]   right into the invoice with a push of a button.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:04.320]   Two million people use freshbooks to do their invoicing.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.680]   I use it for a long time now.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.200]   Of course, I have a pretty large staff.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.960]   It cost me a lot more.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.760]   I really liked fresh books
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.680]   and I think you will too.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.480]   If you are doing your own invoicing,
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.040]   I want you to go to freshbooks.com
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.920]   and try it today.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.320]   Painless billing.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.080]   Gina Tripani, your tip of the week.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.120]   - The Casa Web albums does not, yeah.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.680]   They do not, they just change their calculation
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.200]   for how they calculate how much storage space you've used.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   They do not count small images.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.440]   So images under 800 pixels wide
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.040]   or videos shorter than 15 minutes
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.440]   don't get counted toward your storage quota usage.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.720]   So if you haven't looked at the Casa Web albums in a while,
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.120]   there's also a front page change.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.800]   They list your friends' photos.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.360]   They're trying to make this a little more
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.360]   of a, just trying to improve the photo sharing capabilities.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.480]   So there's a new front page update
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.800]   but they do not count 800 pixel wide photos and videos.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.040]   - So that's cool.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.320]   - Go ahead and upload your archives.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.760]   There are Piccosca Web albums.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.840]   I'm not quite convinced to leave Flickr yet
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.320]   but I'm getting there.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.840]   I really like the way Piccosca Web albums
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.320]   is integrated into Android.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   It's much easier to share images and PWA via Android.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.880]   - And they show up in your gallery,
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.960]   which is really great.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.280]   - Yeah, which is really nice.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   - I'm a big fan of this and you're right.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.480]   I mean, I wish it would kind of become as big as Flickr
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.640]   'cause I'd love to use this instead of Flickr.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.480]   - Yes.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.400]   - And I paid for more, you know,
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.000]   I paid for like hundreds of gigs.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.120]   I don't know how much storage I have.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.760]   But I really, I've always liked this.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.920]   It's cool stuff.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.760]   - And it cooks right into the desktop Piccosca
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.480]   which I love with the facial recognition.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.320]   It's a good product and this little change,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.000]   this algorithm changes maybe kind of take a look at it.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.560]   If you don't pay for extra storage,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.320]   you could, you can send a lot of photos up there
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.760]   at a smaller resolution and without using up your space.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.600]   - Right.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.360]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.120]   - Well, I'll tell you, it will not be
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.520]   that Charlie Sheen is about to hit a million followers.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.360]   - Is he really?
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.200]   - Yeah.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.760]   - My tuss already?
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.640]   - My 65,815.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.480]   - Well, he is winning.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.840]   - I wrote a post today, he's winning.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.760]   - Winning it.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.840]   - I wrote a post complaining about how I think
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   that he was used by press who put him on as if he wasn't sick
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.160]   and did have a problem and they enabled that.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.480]   But, you know, he, people are doing it,
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.320]   we're following him off.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.560]   Hey, we're giving him plenty of attention on Facebook
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.400]   on Twitter.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.200]   - So when did he join?
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.040]   - Yesterday.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.880]   - Yesterday.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.080]   - Yesterday.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.480]   - Yeah, Howard Stern hasn't risen so fast.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.320]   - Well, people are hoping you'll have a meltdown on Twitter.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.480]   That's all.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.400]   It's just our pathetic little love of,
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.640]   it's sad because there's so much real news
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.680]   and important stuff that this gets all the press everywhere.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.360]   Sad, it's commentary, frankly.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.400]   - So that's not my number.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.520]   - What is your number?
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.120]   - My number is number two.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.320]   Bing is now number two worldwide.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.480]   But don't get excited.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:14.640]   Google's Global Market Share in February was 89.94.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.320]   Bing's was 4.37, Yahoo's 3.93, and of course Yahoo is Bing.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.680]   So it adds up, okay.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.240]   But Yahoo losing, you know, isn't necessarily a good thing
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.320]   for Bing.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.120]   - Does anybody, who uses Bing?
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.720]   Anybody out there?
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.160]   Mueller?
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.720]   It's pretty.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.560]   - Yeah.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.400]   - Almost too pretty.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   You feel like it's heavyweight, right?
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.040]   Search engine, but you know, typical for Microsoft,
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.600]   they're fighting yesterday's war.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.960]   - Yeah, 'cause it ain't search.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.920]   - Compare all this everything put into Bing
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.720]   versus what Facebook did with comments.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.960]   What's a better business strategy?
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.120]   - Yeah, boy.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.560]   - Well anyway, that's that.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.840]   - My tool of the week this week is an Android app.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.760]   Food spotting has come to Android.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.280]   I don't know if you're familiar with food spotting,
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.640]   but it's a social network that is about checking
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.600]   into restaurants, most particularly checking
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.120]   into foodstuffs at restaurants.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.160]   So you take a picture of a meal you liked,
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.560]   you can add nom, nom, nom.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.800]   It's nice now because,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.920]   tied into the phone, you can see where you are
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.560]   and you can see what's good around here.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.160]   So these are food that's nearby.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.800]   - It should be called fat gaining.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.320]   (laughing)
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.160]   - Food spotting.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.320]   - And now, by the way, it works with a four square two.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.720]   So you can do a food spotting check in
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.320]   and it will also check into four square four.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.800]   - Leo, can you search just for meat?
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.640]   - Meat.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.680]   Probably, I don't know, that's a good question.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.440]   Low carb face food spotting.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.040]   I don't know, that chicken and prosciutto sandwich
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.480]   looks pretty damn good.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.600]   - Oh man, I spent way too much time drooling over
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.040]   images of.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.480]   - Now it's on Android food spotting.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.520]   By the way. - What a great idea.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.360]   What a great idea.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.080]   What's show me the food button near me?
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.280]   - Show me the food.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.440]   Show me the food.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.760]   Show me the-- - Get the new restaurant,
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.600]   get the map.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.680]   Show me the food.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.120]   - The money, exactly.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.960]   - Exactly.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.600]   But the fact that this is on Android
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.680]   and in such a beautiful way,
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.920]   I mean this is as pretty as the iPhone app,
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   shows that Android, I think for a lot of these kinds
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.720]   of companies is absolutely a parody now.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.400]   And in fact, you have to be on this platform.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.800]   - Not for Gina.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.400]   - I know, she's gone the other way.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.480]   What's wrong with you?
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.440]   - I'm excited for it to use Flipboard on the iPad.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.040]   There's only a few apps now that are just iOS only.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.360]   - Flipboard is truly awesome
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.080]   and I can't wait till there's an Android version.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.000]   Although I've moved now to the Nokia N8,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.960]   I think this is the future.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.440]   Doesn't that look like the future of phones?
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.880]   - Oh yeah, that is the future.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.320]   - Oh baby, this is what a cell phone was meant to be.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.240]   - Nokia is the general motorist of cell phones.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.000]   - It's gonna slide any minute now.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.840]   Serious.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.880]   - 12 megapixel camera, things like a truck.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.200]   Why did I buy this?
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:46.920]   What is wrong with it?
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.760]   - You bought it.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.600]   - Oh yeah.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.840]   - Well I wanna give him a chance.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.720]   I wanna give him a fair break, I forget.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.120]   It's not Windows operating system, is it?
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.680]   - No, it's Symbian.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.560]   - It's Symbian, yeah.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.760]   - I used to like Symbian.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.120]   I don't know.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.920]   - Yeah, Symbian was my first smartphone.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.440]   - Yeah, it was my first time.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]   I had a sign, I loved it.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.720]   I just wish I could, I haven't figured this out yet.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.040]   I'm sure there must be some way I can log into my Google accounts, no.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.760]   So I have to enter in all my contacts.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.480]   By hand, you must be joking.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.080]   - Yeah, that's total BS.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.040]   - Oh, you wanna see the keyboard?
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.960]   Wait a minute, let me see if I get the keyboard.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.280]   Oh, I love the keyboard on this.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.400]   It's a phone pad.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.560]   It's not a keyboard, it's a phone pad.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.960]   It's like, yes.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.120]   Yes, it's hard to believe, I know.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.520]   Anyway, food spotting.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.400]   (laughing)
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.240]   - Fat gaining.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.080]   - Fat gaining.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.200]   Gina Trapani is at smartawear.org
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.160]   where she blogs, you also see her on Life Hacker,
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.040]   many other places, and of course, her great app.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.880]   Are you gonna ever, is that gonna ever be released
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.640]   to the world at large, think up?
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.280]   - We are working on our 1.0 roadmap,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.640]   but we've been in Alpha and Beta for a year now.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.200]   So we're getting to a place where we're gonna be ready to say
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.320]   this is actually ready.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.880]   - Good, exciting.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.720]   - Next few months.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.560]   - I love it.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.320]   - Great show, guys.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.120]   - Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.720]   He's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.520]   I am gonna wind, thank you both for being here.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.520]   I'm gonna wind us up with a movie from Google circa 1999.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.960]   This was when they had get this nine employees.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:36.240]   This is what a big company looks like 11 years ago.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.080]   Good night, everybody.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.320]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.560]   - That's Google.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.680]   - The Googleplex.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.760]   - The Googleplex.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.600]   - The Googleplex.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.440]   - 1.0.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.280]   - Tinker Toys.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.440]   (laughing)
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.240]   - At what point there's a screen with like recent Google searches.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.960]   (laughing)
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.320]   - It's good this stuff exists just so we know, you know.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.840]   It's so cool.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.160]   - Everyone is humble beginnings.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.520]   That's the life lesson here.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.840]   - Yeah, love it.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.680]   These videos.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.800]   - I love it, it's the company with no people.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   - Yeah, they probably, oh look, there's their bookshelf.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.640]   - Oh, that bad guy.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.960]   - Lot of O'Reilly on there.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.840]   I have like three quarters of those books.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.800]   I have all of these books.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.240]   Mathematica, virus scan, that's fine.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.320]   - Virus scan.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:30.760]   - Oh, I forgot to mention.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.680]   We're going to Austin.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.840]   Let me add that.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840]   Plug that into the end of the show.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.960]   We will be at Austin doing,
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.080]   "You Guys Will Be With Me."
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.880]   We'll be doing the show, "Live From Momos."
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.640]   On Sunday, March 13th,
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.360]   starts at one o'clock with the radio show
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.120]   at four o'clock, it's TNT, five o'clock,

[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.400]   Please stop by Momos.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.800]   21 and older, I'm sorry.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.920]   If you're under 21, you just have to stand outside.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.300]   - That is if we don't get trampled
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.120]   at the Apple Store on the 11th.
