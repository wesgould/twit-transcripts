[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.240]   Gina Trapani is in China right now, which is very cool.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   But here's some good news.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200]   He's not in his home territory though.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.240]   He's on our coast, West Coast out here.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.120]   Where are you?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.640]   I'm at Jeff.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.240]   The headquarters for Idea Lab.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.160]   Creator of about 100 companies.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.640]   It's a wonderful place.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.400]   The space is great.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.640]   Bill Gross is the head.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.680]   He may pop in if he can free himself up.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160]   But they create all kinds of great companies here
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.640]   and have over the years.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.480]   I love him.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.800]   He's great.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.760]   He created one of the very first incubator companies.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   Just fantastic.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.120]   Also joining us right now, Kevin Marks.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.680]   Hi, then.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.840]   Very specific in Valley.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.360]   As always, to have on this show, Kevin is now at Salesforce.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.520]   But he has worked at the Google as well as Apple,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   British Telecom.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920]   And I'm sure I'm leaving many companies out.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.560]   Technorality.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.480]   There's big chunk of time.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.960]   Technorality.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.000]   Let's not forget that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.800]   Always forget the hell I've ever had.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.880]   That's like that old game show question, "Dead or Canadian?"
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.920]   I got one of each in here.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.600]   So whatever happened to Technorality?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.760]   They changed.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880]   They pivoted, as we call it now.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.360]   They're an ad network now.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   They drop the number of plugs they're indexing from 100 million
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   to 100,000.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.240]   And focused on building an ad network, which is working
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.920]   and making the money.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640]   But it isn't the company that it was when I was there.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.560]   I remember going to blog world and they were handing out
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.720]   your Technorality ranking on your bad name badge,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.280]   which I thought was very cool.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.840]   I should have apologized for that.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.440]   I realized how permicious all these rankings are.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.480]   We can look at the Google+ ranking stuff that's going on.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.280]   Yeah, well, it's like we're talking ranking.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.360]   The rankings changed dramatically this morning.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.440]   And somehow, I came out in a virtual heat
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.800]   for a second with Robert Scoble.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.360]   But that's only because the real key guys opted out.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.560]   Now, this isn't official.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.680]   If you have to go to a site called socialstatistics.com.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.280]   But apparently, these are the same people
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.240]   who do the Twitter counter.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.720]   And they scrape Google+ to get the rankings.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.200]   You have to add your Google+ account by number
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.040]   to their database.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.960]   Previously, Mark Zuckerberg was number one
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.880]   with well over 110,000 people following him on Google+.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.600]   He's disappeared along with Larry Sergey and Vic Gundrotra.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.080]   They're all gone.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.680]   But I want to thank them because it
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   means that me and Robert can be right up there
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.120]   at the top, along with Kevin Rose Felicia Day.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240]   Tom Anderson, he's not opting out.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.080]   Former founder of MySpace, who says--
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.920]   He's a job.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.640]   He's enjoying being retired.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.960]   He actually is one of the most interesting people to follow.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   He really is.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.800]   I've been amazed that he comes in and leaves very good comments.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.520]   And Tom has been kind of good.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.120]   I wish he'd been a real friend back at MySpace.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.200]   Maybe I still be there.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.360]   He was everybody's friend.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.280]   He was the guy.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   You all when you join MySpace.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.120]   He's the guy who was looking like this at a whiteboard.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.280]   And that's still his picture, by the way.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.640]   I love it that he used the same picture on Google+
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.200]   of the guy looking up the whiteboard.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.920]   For all we know, he looks nothing like this.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.880]   Well, he didn't lie about his age on MySpace as well.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   Did he really?
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.120]   Oh, that's--
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.800]   He did talk to 10 years from his age
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.160]   so he could stay youthful.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   Now, we don't know what happened.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   But some slash dots said, oh, Mark Zuckerberg
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   pulled his account, but I went and checked his account.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   Still there.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   Still there.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   Still there.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.800]   Still there.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.720]   Still his blank as ever.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.600]   And still followed by, we presume,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.800]   hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.600]   because it looks like Google+ now has opened up invitations,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240]   and there are lots of people in there.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.720]   Yes.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.520]   I've now given up.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.120]   I was going through.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.800]   Everybody who followed me so I can find friends,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.720]   I've given up now.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.800]   No, you can't.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.320]   I can't.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   You can't.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.240]   You're followed by 16,000 people.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.120]   I mean, that's-- you know, it's impossible.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   But it did sound like Twitter, right?
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   It turned out as notifications of on Twitter, one back.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.760]   Yeah, you know, that's not--
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   I like the asymmetric following model
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   that Twitter and Google+ use as opposed
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.440]   to the symmetric following model that Facebook uses.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   You follow everybody who follows you on Facebook.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.440]   Although there might be some changes
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.920]   to the way circles work, if we're to believe
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.760]   Vic, who posted on Google+, let us know what changes you
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.080]   want to make, and he allowed people to vote up and down
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.440]   on the changes.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   And the top plus one changes all involve kind of modifications
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.400]   to circles, including some-- I think
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.440]   some really useful modifications to circles.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.040]   This is not going to be the Google+ show.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.840]   Don't worry, folks.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.480]   But we do have to talk about it because--
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.960]   We do.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   --it's taken off.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.040]   Plus, I met with Bradley this week.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.840]   Oh, good.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.440]   It seems to me--
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.960]   I was up in the people giving a privacy talk.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   It seems to be moving faster than any social network
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.000]   in living memory except maybe Facebook.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.760]   And they're very open.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   There were some things that he asked me about that were,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   you know, under the NDA because he just
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.560]   wanted to get some response, just
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.360]   some things that we'll not know what they're talking about.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.920]   The things that I hit him up for.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.480]   I said the problem to the breaking of cron with the comments.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.880]   I said my solution is just give me
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   the separate feed of latest posts.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.120]   And until you have that, by the way,
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.440]   it's not going to be very good for news.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.240]   And he said, I don't know if I believe we're not.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.800]   But he said, oh, I hadn't heard that idea before.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.360]   So maybe we can get that.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   I also pushed for the idea of more links,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.680]   ability to put more than one link in a post.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.280]   Otherwise, it's kind of irresponsible in the blog world,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   not to do that.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.720]   And then third, I begged him to support the standards that
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.960]   are starting to come out there now.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.480]   I think it's like the hashtag.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.360]   And by support, I mean, put it in search and fill in hashtags
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.800]   and do all the--
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   Well, search on Google+ would be nice to start with.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.680]   And a hashtag is just a start.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.760]   It's kind of a specialized form of search,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   a kind of a prepop.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.200]   Well, we're bounding the Twitter search was also a shame.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.720]   Basically--
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.920]   The real time search.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.320]   The real time search has gone away from there.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.160]   And the story was that Google and Twitter
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.400]   hadn't managed to renew their firehouse agreement.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.760]   But it wasn't very clear of who decided not to renew it
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.960]   and where that went.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.720]   But that means they pulled the real time search just
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.160]   when you would need it for plus, which is kind of a shame.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.440]   Well, you might think that plus will end up
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.280]   taking Twitter's place as it grows.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.760]   Yeah, but the point of the real time search
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.360]   was searching more than just Twitter.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.880]   Right.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.280]   Twitter was the bulk of it because it has more public stuff.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.160]   Yeah, because actually, I think Leo--
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.760]   and I'm here full disclosure at Ideal Lab,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.120]   where they have Uber Media and I
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.520]   am a nano micro little Chinese investor in that.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   But as I was thinking about it before I got here,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.040]   I kind of realized that we actually now
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.960]   have something that I'm calling the Chachka cloud.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.440]   Is the Twitter used to own that?
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.360]   Twitter was the only one where we made Chachkas,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.880]   everything else or something else.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.960]   And then Google+ changes that overnight.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.880]   And now you have little tiny posts.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.960]   And then I guess I would now throw a tumbler into this.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.240]   And the interesting thing is, can you
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.920]   do across that world?
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   Right.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.520]   And that's why I wish that they would support the hashtag.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.800]   Because then you can start to see what
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.920]   people are saying about news of the world
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.040]   across Google+ and Twitter and Tumblr and so on.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.880]   And each one can still be its own servers with its own
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.240]   pluses and minuses and its own differences.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.880]   And you can choose to be which ones you want to be in.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.680]   But when you want to find news of the world news,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.320]   and not get the noise, the pure search would give me,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.840]   I want the hashtag.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.480]   So those kinds of conventions Google, I think,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.680]   needs to support.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.160]   You're right, search is the first thing.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.880]   But then enable it in new ways.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.120]   Is there any reason to think that--
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   I mean, look at this is-- it's weak, too, kids.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.760]   Is there any reason to think that the Google won't
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.800]   add all of these obvious features?
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   Oh, yeah, I think that they're working like crazy.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   I'm sure they want to do that.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.840]   But the challenge is that with all of this stuff
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.360]   is how the stuff is connected.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.440]   And it's interesting to see that there
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.840]   is similar flood problems that we had on Friend Feed and Bars,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   on Plus, which is that if Leo or Scobel or someone
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.240]   with a menu follower turns up in a post,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.320]   suddenly you'll swamp with everyone else's comments.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.200]   And that's the piece that Twitter got right
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.120]   through not actually having a threaded comment thing,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.480]   but also having a much less explicit conversation.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.160]   It has this notion of overlapping publics.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   And the decision they made with the app replies
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.000]   to only show the app replies to people you're already following
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.680]   I think was actually one of those critical ones
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.080]   that we complain about at the time.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.120]   It was actually very wise in retrospect.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.080]   Because what it means is by default,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.800]   your feed is only showing the conversations between people
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.120]   that you already know, which dampens down
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.080]   that flood of followers effect.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.120]   And it's tricky enough when it's
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.800]   Leo or Scobel with 20,000 followers.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:55.600]   But once it becomes Neil Gaiman or Lady Gaga,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.280]   with millions of followers, that stuff will break down radically.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.640]   Well, I'm trying to understand what it is that bugs people.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   Is it that the comment threads go on and on and you see them all?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.640]   No, it's not. It breaks the cron.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.600]   Is that you get it?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.040]   Oh, it's the fact that the heavily commented stuff surfaces up.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.080]   It's both. It's both.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.360]   It breaks the chronological order.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.600]   It also enforces a chronological order
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.560]   to see millions of me toish comments.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.680]   So the challenge is, if you ask a question on Twitter,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.160]   you will get a whole bunch of out replies
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.200]   and you can look at them quickly and decide which ones you want to respond to.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.320]   If you ask a question on buzz, those turn into a giant conversation thread
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.840]   because you've brought in thousands of people.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.520]   And there's a positive feedback that amplifies it and makes it more annoying.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.560]   And it also makes it easier for people to take over the conversation
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.400]   because everyone sees the entire conversation.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.720]   I suspect Google thought, as I kind of do,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.560]   that as long as you provide an easy way to mute this,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.280]   which of course I can't mute my own comment.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   Let's mute this one, then I don't see it anymore and it's gone.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.080]   It's still the question of what the default feels like.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.360]   Does this default feel like there are people I know here
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.920]   or other people I don't know here?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.160]   What happens with Twitter is, by default,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.200]   the first view you see is the people you've chosen to follow.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   You have to actually click something to see out replies
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.600]   unless you're running a different client
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.320]   and you have to make it an extra effort to see the second degree stuff.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.920]   Whereas on this, it's pushed back at you.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.440]   So if you make the mistake of following Robert Scoble,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.160]   suddenly your entire view of this is through his lens
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.360]   because he's feeding so much traffic into it
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.280]   and so he'll be responding to him.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.160]   And that's a sort of subtle thing that...
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.960]   One of the reasons that Twitter does work
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.840]   for ridiculously famous people is they can still decide
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.760]   to have a conversation amongst people they want to have
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.240]   and have lots of people asking them
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.880]   that they can go and dip into when they feel like being more magnanimous.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.080]   But that doesn't actually cause a problem for everyone else.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.760]   So if Lady Gaga joined and got a thousand comments on every thread,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.560]   she would always be at the top is what you're saying.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.240]   Well, not necessarily a bit at the top, but they fixed that a bit.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240]   So they may be...
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.800]   It doesn't seem like that. Yeah.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   If someone...
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.920]   Who knows, comment on it.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.960]   But the thing is, once someone does,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.000]   I follow enough people who follow Lady Gaga
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.080]   and make comments on one of her threads because she's a phenomenon.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.400]   And that would then pull the entire thread in
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.000]   and the other 100,000 little monsters making hand gestures and saying,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.680]   "Rah."
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.200]   Well, but that's a bit too hard.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.240]   Okay, so that...
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.000]   But if it's a good thread, I want to see the other people's engagement.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.960]   So that's really more of a problem with Lady Gaga
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.680]   and the noise of her followers than it is.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.400]   Right, it comes in truncated and you can choose to explode it or not.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.080]   So that's okay.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.120]   It'll show me top two latest to something.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.680]   It'll give me a sample of two comments and then it's up to me
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.760]   as to whether it's explode in the seal all 100 or not.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.920]   I seem to have followed something really not what I wanted to follow, by the way.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.640]   A great story about Lady Gaga.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.560]   I just heard here at Idealab.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.480]   I arrive in LA as they are having what they're calling here.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   I'm going to fit the word of it, but they're closing the 405 freeway.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.000]   Oh, yeah, crazy.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.960]   Comic-Geddon thing.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.080]   Yeah, I'm a car-me-gett.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.400]   And they're going to absolutely berserk here.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.600]   It's hilarious.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.400]   It's as if the city is having a bypass operation.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.800]   You have to take Sepulveda for crying out loud.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.600]   This law said cut off because it gets back, right?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.440]   And they're going berserk here.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.960]   My launch companion told me that they the city asked Lady Gaga to tweet this so that more
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.080]   people would find out.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   Wow.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.600]   And I think about that.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.920]   That mean what happened was Lady Gaga has more followers than Angelus Times.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.320]   She has replaced the civil defense system.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.640]   Remember when we used to have on radio and it got put off a tone and burp burp.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.480]   This has been an alert of the civil defense.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.080]   That's Lady Gaga now.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.640]   Not just that.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.320]   She's also the Los Angeles Times and tell them that she goes, "God, oh my God,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.080]   ah, ah, ah, we are 405 is closed.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   That's, I don't know if that's a good comment or not on our society.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.880]   That's really, so now if I see, I wish I could search for Carmageddon on Google Plus.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:32.240]   I kind of can because I can go site equals colon plus Google dot com and then Carmageddon.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.720]   But it's kind of it should be it should be internal and hashtag should be implemented.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.680]   But I think all that stuff.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.840]   They're working hard on it.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080]   The fact that they're in listening and doing all that, I think is important.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.320]   You can see how hard this is though because just.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:52.240]   No, but the thing is that this there is this problem that following people's audiences are
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.680]   not normally distributed.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.440]   They're expansionally distributed.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.840]   You have Lady Gaga at one end and then sort of at that same mind of the curve,
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.080]   there's Leo and people who have a lot of followers.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.120]   And then way down the other end, there's a large mass of people who are talking to a handful of
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.840]   people most of the time.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.680]   And you will never see them at the top because they have so few followers, right?
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.320]   Right.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.040]   And the thing is there's you want different things at different phases of constructing one of these
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.560]   things. So at the startup phase, you do want to demonstrate lots of engagement.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.200]   So you clearly do want to bring people into this.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.280]   There's something there phase that we're seeing with plus.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   But after a while you overshoot and you get to this this flood is unmanageable and then people
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.760]   back off and it's a classic.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.360]   So it's fixable.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.720]   It's fixable.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   They probably are doing this on purpose.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.200]   They may have been initially doing it on purpose to amplify this, but it'd be tricky to
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:57.840]   actually get the thing that Twitter sort of stumbled into right because it is a different
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   presumption about what a common thread looks like.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.040]   This is something that YouTube has this issue to.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.400]   YouTube has some videos with millions of people on them and the comment threads are completely
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.040]   useless.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.280]   And it has some small ones that are, you know, somebody's art film, the comment thread is actually
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   useful. There was the, somebody did a response to YouTube's copyright thing that explained
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.200]   what fair use actually was rather than the YouTube copyright school saying, if you copy anything,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   you must be breaking the law.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.800]   And the cute pirate cats and things.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.600]   I loved it.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.680]   Did a nice reply to that. But the comments to that one are very sensible discussions of
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.160]   what actually fair use constitutes what corporate is because it's a, you know, it's a, it's a
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.720]   narrow thing.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.000]   It didn't he's linked to it earlier.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.040]   Here's my problem with that is I saw it.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.720]   It went by in the stream and I can't find the sucker.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.560]   I mean, this is the other problem is that there's no good way to kind of pin stuff or.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.600]   Well, why are you, you can't favorite things, which is a Google function.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.320]   They should put on it.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.520]   Well, we have a worker, there is a workaround, which is you create a circle with only you in it.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.120]   And then you, you reshare whatever you want to save to your circle.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   Right.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.480]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.520]   No, no, no, come to that.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.240]   The thing I, one thing I don't understand watching the two weeks here is the,
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.440]   I'm going to say this the wrong way.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.080]   You can find it by calling it.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.040]   Quality of posts.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:22.160]   The quality of posts is what I mean by that is that why are animated gifts taking over
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.360]   because we can.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.960]   We couldn't on Twitter and we can hear.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   But even Tumblr doesn't doesn't mean Tumblr, you can have a, you know, a cat picture.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.480]   I don't have a single animated GIF in the first 10 or 20 posts.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.920]   But then Chris Perlow would do it.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.840]   And even though I unfollowed him.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.400]   Did.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.560]   No, but now everybody shares Chris Perlow animated gifts or those, those kinds of pictures you have,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.040]   right?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.840]   I don't mind these.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.480]   Is it all right?
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.640]   The 20th time you've seen it.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.400]   Well, look, it keeps, it keeps coming out.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.200]   That's the problem.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.040]   I don't need to see every reshare of it because there's a comment on it.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.720]   It's creating a kind of low quality noise in a way that they have to dedoop.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.000]   Not just, you know, one of the Twitter problems is the retweet, retweet, retweet.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   You see the same thing over again with retweeted and I wish they could dedoop that.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.240]   Here, I think you want to dedoop the shares because every time it's shared, they'll just tell you that.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.280]   But I also want to dedoop the media behind it.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.880]   Yes.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   Jeff, you've already seen that funny picture.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.360]   You don't see that.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.800]   It's not funny to attempt time.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.160]   But these are all things that could be fixed.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.400]   I think we, I don't want to spend like, now we're talking about feature requests for Google
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.200]   Plus because God knows they'll be, I'm sure rolling out a ton of them.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.280]   They've, they've been very slow in the first two weeks.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.720]   They only, you know, only a few little changes here and there.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.080]   It's kind of funny.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.400]   That's kind of funny that, that not doing huge changes in two weeks is now considered slow.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.520]   I think it's good.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.240]   I think it's good.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.200]   I, I think they're probably wise not to jump to every request.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.720]   However, you know, there's a guy who did an analysis which, which I thought was quite,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.080]   quite ingenious.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.520]   He attracts the, how common surnames are.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.720]   And by looking at the growth of particular surnames and then comparing them to the overall
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.240]   commonality in the US of those surnames, he's able to kind of fair, I think it sounds fairly
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.600]   accurately project the size of Google Plus, at least in the US because he's not doing it outside US.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   He estimates 10 million users by this weekend.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.600]   Does that sound off to you?
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   Sounds high.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.760]   So the, I guess what will make them believable to me is how much they emphasized international.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.240]   There's a lot of international.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.760]   There's a hell of a lot, which is, which is wonderful.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   I love how.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.640]   I also told them, I quoted Gina and three or four meetings there that they don't have
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.480]   enough women and not just have women, but also have people who are going to have
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.360]   different kinds of problems with the service so they know it.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.640]   And I said, you should put on all of Glam and all of Blogger overnight.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.840]   And that would help you a lot.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.640]   Right.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.840]   But the other thing is that they haven't got anyone under 18 on there,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.440]   which I think is a massive mistake because that is, you know,
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.040]   if they said she shared this with your family and I thought, great, I invite my sons.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.960]   They said, you can't, they can't come on there.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   They're under 18.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.040]   So that is a massive piece of usage.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.360]   I'm sure they love it and enjoy dealing with it.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.840]   And it's a group that will test this in ways that they haven't thought of yet.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.240]   We, speaking of that, I think we see, of course, all the public engagement and probably,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.640]   at least you and me, Jeff, post publicly for the most part.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.360]   But I'm wondering how many people are using it in the other way.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.000]   You could absolutely use this Allah Facebook and just post to particular circles.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.480]   I've tried a little bit with work posting to the Twits Circle.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.800]   That's not worked well because there's so much other noise.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.400]   They don't see that.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.720]   Right.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.840]   Well, they could, they could click on, you need to, then you have to have synchronous circles.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.560]   You have to, your staff has to agree that you all have a Twits Circle.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.840]   And they have to know the look.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.000]   Once in a while, which would be a hassle to manage, but I think that's something where you can,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.280]   I would like to have potential there.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.080]   I think there's something there that is different than Twitter,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   which is that can be used in a variety of kind of ways that are not Twitter-like.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.480]   It could be used to just talk to your family.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.520]   I tried using it as a DM system.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   And of course, again, the noise kills it because the DM I sent, I'm sure,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.880]   scrolled way off the page before.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.680]   Well, it's just I've been notifications.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.720]   Those ones, those ones too.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.520]   So that if you actually ping someone, they'll show up there.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:19.920]   But yeah, the...
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.360]   I have so many notifications.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.080]   Is that how it looks?
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.040]   I mean, I don't, I guess I'm unusual.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.160]   So many of them are follows, yeah.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.240]   I can't, I can't keep track of my notifications.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   There's always nine notifications at all times.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.120]   I wish we get, you know, one of the features that I use on Twitter now is I watch my medium
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   wonks list more than my Twitter feed.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.880]   And I like that I can publish that list.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.520]   It'd be nice if you could publish a Twit List to your fellow employees and say,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.480]   "You know, just circle and follow that."
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   What about Kevin Rose who says I'm going to...
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.120]   He says he would eat your ex-KevinRose.com to my Google+ and I'm not having a blog anymore.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.360]   Is that just a showboat or is that a...
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160]   It's a dumb idea, right?
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.800]   Something like that.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.200]   Well, one of the advantages though is you get all this engagement.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.000]   I mean, even a big name like Kevin Rose probably gets 10 times more people
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.720]   seeing everything he writes on Google+.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.040]   Then he does on his blog.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.840]   Oh yeah.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.560]   I mean, you know, this is, believe me, this is my publisher is salivating over the
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.000]   possibilities for both of them here.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.200]   I won't bug you too much, folks, but I will.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.080]   So soon.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.880]   September.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.920]   Is it ever a part?
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.000]   Probably six.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Probably six.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.480]   Probably parts.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   I've been a Schuster.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.640]   Simon Schuster, not a news corp publisher.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.120]   No, not a news corp, but I love to change the news corp.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.080]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.040]   I didn't know that about you.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.320]   I would.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.880]   I pulled the book.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.520]   Is that because you read a lot about a news corp in the book?
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.920]   Yeah, I'm talking about open and closed companies and institutions and
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.960]   news corp is the most closed institution I could imagine in media by far.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.800]   And you had a deal with them?
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.120]   I had a deal with them, but I did not sign the contract.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.840]   Interesting.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.720]   So I pulled the book from HyperCollins and news corp and frankly,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.520]   it was all the current kerfuffle and hoopla.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.480]   I am glad not to be there.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   This news of the world story is unbelievable.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.000]   We're going to get to that because I do want to get your take on that.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.560]   Absolutely.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.520]   And Kevin's English.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.240]   So.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.800]   Yes.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.040]   I'm.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.800]   He can speak about this.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.480]   Kevin's not a news of the world.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.840]   In the proper, in the proper.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.600]   No, for a while now.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.480]   It's just not like I just won the web.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.000]   Yeah, but it's still you got to say it right.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.680]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.480]   I think we'll talk a little more about Google plus and there's a lot more about
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.080]   Android and all sorts of stuff going on.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.760]   Gina Trapani, not with us.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.720]   I know she's right now.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.280]   She's going through withdrawal, even though it's the middle of the night in China.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.520]   She's going, I feel I should be doing something.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.000]   I hope she's having a great time in Shanghai.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.400]   But she'll be back in a couple of weeks.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.760]   This is the second to last, by the way, this week in Google,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.640]   we'll be doing from the studio, the old cottage.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.080]   Next week, we'll be here.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.400]   Two weeks hence, we will be all.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.080]   And I had a major like all hands engineering meeting yesterday
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   and all I kept saying is, are you sure we could do it on July 24th?
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.800]   Are you sure July 24th?
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   You know, that's only 11 days.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   Are you sure?
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.960]   And they said, yes, we're sure.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.040]   So we'll be doing the show in the new studio soon.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.720]   And you know what's going to be in the backyard?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.080]   Yeah, we might.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.880]   Who knows?
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.480]   You know what's going to be cool though, is that instead of being in this Hollywood square thing,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.160]   we're going to decompose it, deconstruct it, and you'll each of you will have a seat at the
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.520]   table with a monitor.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.840]   Around the table.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.880]   It might look so weird that we have to do something else.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.640]   It's on the nerd character on.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.480]   Yeah, Sheldon.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   Sheldon, what's this thing?
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.480]   What do you call it?
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.240]   Yeah, he has this remote thing where he rolls around.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.440]   Yeah, what's the name for that?
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.160]   They have a name for it.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.200]   Is there a name for that?
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.960]   Yeah, because that's what all the guests will be now.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.080]   Yeah, they will be.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.280]   So whatever that is, that's what we're going to make you be.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.920]   I'm watching.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.560]   We don't chat.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:56.960]   Oh, that's true.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   Chad, apparently doesn't watch Big Bang Theory.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.360]   Gosh, that's surprising.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.640]   Virtual presence device.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.600]   No, that's my name.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.240]   I thought it did.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.920]   All right, never mind.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.320]   Sheldon.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.000]   Roll Sheldon.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.800]   Yeah, we're all Sheldon's.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.080]   We'll call it Sheldon.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.480]   Why not?
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.200]   That's good.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.680]   I like that.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.600]   On our Sheldon today, to my left, Jeff Jarvis, to my right, I'm Kevin Marks.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.120]   I think that's it, exactly.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.280]   Hey, before we go on though, I do want to talk a little bit about our good friends at Squarespace,
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.320]   the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.200]   Goodness gracious.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.360]   You could make your blog be just a Google+ blog, but I think you really should have
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.640]   a presence on the web that you control, that you own, that you have.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.000]   And this is it.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   This is the place to do it.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.320]   Squarespace.com.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.280]   Actually, KevinRose.com was a Squarespace site.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.720]   He's going to regret this.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.200]   First of all, plenty of bandwidth.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.240]   You never run out.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.200]   Can you do this?
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.400]   Can you post and manage comments on your iPhone or iPad on that other one?
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.960]   No, but you can't on Squarespace a great app.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   You can even watch your stats.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.400]   And yes, you get full stats.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   You'll know your visitors.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.280]   The ability to incorporate photo galleries and social integration with Twitter and Facebook
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.200]   and all the RSS feeds, Flickr.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.720]   This makes it so much easier to design a site.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.000]   You don't need to have any CSS or JavaScript skills.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.600]   If you do, hey, all the more power to you, you can do that too.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.520]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.320]   You can import your data from all the major APIs,
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.400]   movable type, WordPress type pad or blogger, and export to.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.560]   It's fully circular.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.400]   So you're never trapped.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.120]   Now, Squarespace includes hosting and the best content management software out there.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.840]   It's just a beautiful, elegant piece of code that makes your site sing.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.760]   You never run out of bandwidth with Squarespace.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.800]   And of course, some of the best people in the world use it.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.280]   I wonder now if Squarespace is going to change,
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.360]   they have a little plug from Kevin Rose on here.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.640]   I wonder if they're going to have to take that off.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.720]   He says things like, "I can never bring down my Squarespace site."
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.400]   He says, "Here, 85,000 uniques to my site today,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.760]   KevinRose.com from Dig."
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.160]   I guess you know how dated it is from that.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.640]   I know this shouldn't shock me, but it does insane.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.520]   Squarespace, just fantastic.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.080]   Here's the deal.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.280]   Go to Squarespace.com.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.080]   You'll find that big green button that says, "Try it free."
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.040]   You can start a site.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.120]   You can actually start many, many sites.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.880]   Just kind of play with the tools you get access to everything for two weeks.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.360]   At the end of the two weeks, you can buy the site or not.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.000]   You let it go.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.240]   Price is very affordable.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.440]   12 bucks a month if you sign up for a year,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.200]   even less if you sign up for a longer term.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   And here's the deal.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.840]   If you use the offer code TWIG7,
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.720]   you will get 10% off your new site for the first six months.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.680]   That's a good deal.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.320]   10% off for the first six months.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.480]   Squarespace.com, when you sign up,
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.560]   use the offer code TWIG7.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.440]   It's the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.880]   Try to catch you in a yawn, Jeff.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.280]   I did.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.560]   I thought I was safe.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   Try to get them all the way up.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.040]   I got jet lag.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.600]   You're in Cali right now.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.280]   It's possible Bill Gross will pop his head in.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.720]   If he does, we'll say hello.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.440]   He's actually post-spherely actively as well.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.480]   He's very good at that.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.040]   He's loving.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.360]   Plus.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.880]   You know who else?
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.440]   Richard Branson just started posting.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.160]   Allegedly.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.560]   Allegedly.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.280]   You think it's not him?
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.760]   Well, we haven't seen a chain of--
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.200]   We can't verify.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.240]   We'll fit anywhere else that we have.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.600]   Is--
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.400]   I think it was the girl in Who's the Boss verified.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.880]   Is that her?
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.520]   Alyssa Milano verified using Twitter.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.320]   She tweeted.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.400]   That is my Google+ account.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.120]   So now we know it's--
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.480]   Well, and what was the job?
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:42.960]   We could all verify.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   I actually have a new job.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.480]   We could verify using Scoble.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.920]   Scoble owes everyone.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.760]   Scoble verified Zuck for us.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:49.920]   Right.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.120]   So we can verify on me.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.240]   We do have a way to do this properly,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.120]   which is "row me."
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.480]   There is a way to actually do this
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.320]   by connecting science together with "row me"
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.840]   used to say, "This is me and this is also me."
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.160]   That's the way you're supposed to do it.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.480]   So--
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.960]   But oddly, Google isn't actually amplifying that.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.680]   Yeah, I wish they would.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.280]   Well, they're kind of rolling that out.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.160]   In fact--
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   They do make it as part of the "row author" stuff, yes.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.480]   It's the author thing.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   The author thing.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:10.960]   The author thing.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.920]   So what you do just for people who want to know-- here's my website,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.600]   my canonical website.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.440]   And what you need is a page per author.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.360]   So I have-- this is my bio.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:27.040]   And in the code of this bio is the HTML--
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.960]   "rail equals, quote, me."
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.440]   End quote.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.400]   Is that right, Kevin?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:32.880]   Yes.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.600]   That's right.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.880]   And then in every post--
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.240]   So if I go to a blog post also in the HTML,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.800]   invisible to humans, but not to the Google,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   is the code "rail equals, quote, author."
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.680]   Quote.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.560]   Is that right?
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:46.800]   Yep.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.840]   Yes.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.560]   And then by doing so--
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.040]   It's not an every post--
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   It's not an every post--
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.240]   --the theory when I search for myself on Google
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.880]   that the articles that I wrote--
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.200]   or the pages that I authored, I guess--
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.720]   Oh, it worked.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.200]   No.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.680]   Have my--
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   There's a--
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   There's a Leo.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.760]   There's a Leo.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   Right.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.440]   So is this verification?
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.240]   Yes.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.600]   The thing that's--
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.100]   Yes.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:10.880]   This is verification by--
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.320]   it's distributed verification.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.160]   This is the same as the Social Grant API stuff
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.560]   that we did way back when.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.240]   And it's the XFN standard is--
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.360]   It's XFN.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:21.840]   That's right.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.320]   It's part of that.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   And XFN has a number of other things.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.200]   Here's Bill Gross.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.520]   Let's say hello to Bill Gross.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.480]   Hey, Bill.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:28.960]   Hi.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.760]   Well, we're thrilled to have you.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.360]   Please enjoy it.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.960]   So is Uber Media going to continue doing the Twitter stuff?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   Or I know you're very positive about Google+.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.160]   You commented on a bunch of the things already today.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.720]   How great the engagement is on Google+,
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.960]   it's just fantastic.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.040]   So I'd love to figure out ways to work with that as well.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.480]   And a few different things you brought up.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.800]   First, I also took the leap like Kevin
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.600]   and pointed my blog over.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.640]   You said it was kind of dumb.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.200]   You did that, really?
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.960]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.840]   Well, I did it because of the engagement.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.080]   And the ability to write something
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.200]   and get so much positive feedback
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.360]   and actually talk with people, the engagement was so much higher.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   And the spam from my WordPress blog was so much worse.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.480]   It was unbelievable.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.000]   I really couldn't talk with anybody.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.640]   But the fidelity and the signal-to-noise ratio
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   being so good at Google+, now, it'll
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   be interesting to see if that can hold up as it opens up wider.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.280]   The rumors of between 4 and 1/2 million and 10 million people
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.040]   right now is probably in that range.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.280]   What happens when there's 50 million people or 100 million
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.160]   people will the signal-to-noise be as good?
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.040]   And I think that Google, because of their algorithms,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.320]   probably can do a better job at that than most people.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.360]   So maybe that will hold up.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.160]   We'll see.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.040]   You brought up one other thing earlier.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.720]   The insight that you had about the clever way
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.560]   that Twitter only shares the comments with other people
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.640]   you're following.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   That was a very good insight when you talked about that earlier.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.680]   That might be something that's necessary to really fill
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.400]   throughout the comment stream from being so huge.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.560]   But right now, a huge comment stream is a plus.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.320]   We'll see if that turns into a minus.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.760]   Well, there's a transition point on particular streams as well.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.520]   I think when there are four or five comments on there,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.480]   you're happy to see them all.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.760]   But when it hits 1,000, you clearly
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.400]   want some way of reducing that.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.800]   That's a really strong signal that makes sense to you.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.280]   And it's one that works well on Twitter.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.760]   Absolutely.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.240]   And then Jeff, you brought up the issue,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.480]   the changing of the cron.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.160]   That something has to be done to--
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.040]   maybe your idea, the one you suggested to them,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.640]   of give you a choice.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.160]   I either want a chronological order.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.040]   I want it bumped up.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   Or again, I trust Google more than almost anyone
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.000]   to come up with a clever algorithm to try and make that
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.240]   work out.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.760]   That they didn't this well in a first release.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.120]   But they're even calling a .1 release, not even a 1.0.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.760]   But even as a 1.0, it's a brilliant product.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.840]   Well, what was your take on the real-time search going away,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.040]   Bill?
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.720]   Yeah, I'm really curious.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.560]   I don't know whether it was prompted from the Twitter side
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.440]   or from the Google side.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.280]   So I really don't know.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.440]   I actually thought that the tweets being integrated
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.960]   into Google searches, it was starting to show up more and more.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.760]   And it was starting to be pretty good.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.360]   So it is kind of a shame that it's gone,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.000]   because it was starting to look pretty nice.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   But look, now Google is getting so much content in Google
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.800]   Plus, they can start servicing Google+ posts in search.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.120]   And maybe they can do a better algorithmic job,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.040]   because they have more signals about what's actually relevant
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.440]   or not.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.800]   So part of the irony of that is that because so many--
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.960]   so much is made, we don't know how much, but it's
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.320]   also made not public.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.280]   They're having a lot less there than they could have.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:52.080]   The other question, Bill, why do you think that Google didn't
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.040]   include search in the beginning of Google Plus?
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.320]   Well, Google is a search company.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.400]   So they're going to do search really, really well.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.720]   The only thing I could think of is it just wasn't ready for prime
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.160]   time, because they wanted to make it perfect.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   And they had something so good, they wanted to roll it out.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.240]   They're going to have great search.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.000]   And that's going to make a big difference.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.600]   And I'm really curious.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.280]   I've been posting-- and you guys were talking about this earlier--
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.520]   mostly public, because I have things
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.040]   that I want to share with people.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.680]   And I don't want to limit it to just a circle,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.640]   unless I have a family-like circle, or a private one.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.280]   Like you were talking about making up business ones,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.880]   like a media one, we have an ideal M1.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.320]   But most of the things that I'm sharing,
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720]   I'm trying to open up a broader discussion.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.520]   I wonder how many people are doing that versus how many people
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.800]   are really keeping their things very tightly in circles
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.840]   and more private.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.720]   I think one of the beautiful things about Twitter
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.760]   and one of the things about Google Plus is it is public.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.680]   It is very different from Facebook.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.120]   I wonder if that's the way people are really going to end up using it.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.400]   And something about what you were talking about earlier
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.560]   about the very subtle rules, very little things,
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.880]   can make a big impact on how the thing plays out.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.320]   You said, you're laughing.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.920]   Why are people doing that in a minute shifts?
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.960]   Because they can.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.160]   So maybe some of the little rules that Google Tweaks will
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.760]   have wild unintended consequences.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   But I think they'll stay on top of it to correct things
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.800]   and bring it back to a happy medium.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.440]   I turned myself down.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.280]   Surely they are aware that everything they do has a huge impact.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.000]   It's almost like a terrarium.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.600]   You take the turtle out and everything dies.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.760]   It's a really good job.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.120]   Well, it's an ecosystem.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   I think that that's probably a fair comparison.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.080]   Yes.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.560]   You really agree.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.320]   How do you guys see the relationship of Google Plus,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.760]   to Twitter, to Tumblr, to blog posts?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   How do you see the cloud of Chautres and all that?
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.440]   I think my question here is--
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.480]   and maybe Bill has some insight, and I know you and Kevin
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.280]   might as well--
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.120]   it's clear that there's a lot of stickiness and appeal
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.600]   to Google Plus.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.680]   And I'm just not sure, A, what it is.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.640]   Maybe it's UI.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.320]   Maybe it's the group that's there right now.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.520]   And I'm not sure how long-lived that will be.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.280]   If it's just the group that's there now,
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.080]   that's going to change dramatically.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.440]   Is there some magic sauce in Google Plus?
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.120]   And what is it?
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.840]   Bill, do you have a thought on that?
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.600]   Well, for me, the biggest magic sauce
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.160]   is the group that is there certainly matters.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.560]   But I think that there's something else they've done.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.040]   They have taken some of the best ideas of Facebook,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   some of the best ideas of Twitter,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.040]   and then they've added smart threading and smart groups.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.160]   And that is a relatively small, big innovation
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.920]   at the same time.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.960]   It's small in that, well, how could that little thing
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.520]   make that much difference?
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   But it really does.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.520]   It forms a new type of self-expression,
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.840]   just like the rules of Twitter formed a new type
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.600]   of self-expression, the asymmetry that you brought up
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   about it relative to Facebook.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.200]   A whole life form emerged from the rules that Twitter set up.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.040]   And there's this new interesting life form emerging
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.200]   because of the rules that have been set up.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   Now, as you said, it's a terrarium.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.360]   So and then spammers are going to show up.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.600]   So right now, this never is more than invited yet.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.520]   They're the acid rain of the terrarium.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.040]   But it's going to be amazing when it goes fully open.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.000]   People are going to be like every system,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.040]   trying to game it for their benefit
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.680]   and find ways to make money.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.320]   It strikes me.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.720]   I know you have a lot of investment in Twitter,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.000]   although I imagine all of your clients, the Uber Media
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.960]   clients, they're really a complete platform agnostic.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.280]   So it doesn't, from your point of view, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.920]   In fact, you might have some feelings about it
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.000]   not being Twitter after the way they treated you.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.520]   And I won't go on any further.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.800]   I'm just wondering if, though, that Twitter may--
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.040]   what may happen is a very clear roles
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.080]   may emerge for Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.000]   And they may be able to coexist quite nicely.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.560]   Twitter really is going to, I think,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.720]   become, in many ways, more infrastructure, a signaling
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.400]   system.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.720]   That's what ended up happening to friend, feed, and buzz.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.600]   People didn't even really visit that often.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.880]   They used it as a signaling system.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.960]   I think that all of them are going to survive and thrive.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.840]   But not Twitter and Facebook are not
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.160]   going away because Google+,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.600]   This is not a Twitter killer.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.520]   No, but I think that there is going
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.240]   to be a level of innovation on those two platforms,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.720]   on Twitter and Facebook, that is forced by Google+,
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.400]   which I think is great for consumers.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.600]   That's right.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   Right.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.880]   Totally great.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.400]   I think, look, I think Bing made Google raise their game
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.800]   in a great way.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.880]   And I think Google+ is going to make everybody raise their game
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.080]   in a great way.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.000]   One last question, Bill, and we'll let you go.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I know you have lots to do.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.360]   I'm just curious if you see this as--
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.520]   I have to say, and this is a show about Google,
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.000]   about the cloud.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.960]   For the last year, we kind of felt like Google maybe
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.800]   had lost its way a little bit, was not
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.160]   able to innovate in the way a small company,
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.840]   a nimble company is able to innovate.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.840]   It strikes me that this launch along with Hangout
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.440]   and these new products kind of shows a Google that
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.360]   is still innovative, still is creative,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.800]   still can do something very significant.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.560]   Do you feel that is the case?
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.840]   Well, I totally feel this is a--
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.920]   Google has its mojo back moment.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.640]   Exactly.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.480]   I think that this is a collision of a lot of work.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.840]   Obviously, this has been worked on for a long time.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.480]   But this is a collision of so many different threads
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.320]   Google's been taking, both their infrastructure, their video,
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.440]   their Chrome browser.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.640]   Look how valuable that is to this.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   So many different threads have come together to make this great.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.560]   And it's the right time and the right place and the right product.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.760]   I mean, it's a really, really well-executed product.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.440]   So I think it's amazing to watch some of the companies
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.880]   today that are this big, to watch Apple, a company this big,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.920]   to grow at that kind of rate, to grow their revenues
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   year over year like they have with such wild innovation,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.200]   and to watch a company like Google that's this big,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.160]   with that many tens of thousands of employees
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.040]   to innovate like this, that is damn impressive.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.240]   Really, really impressive.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.320]   Pills done so many great things at IdeaLab.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.160]   So many great companies have come out of IdeaLab.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.520]   Is there a company that you're excited about that's
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.040]   on the horizon that you want to talk about?
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.960]   Well, I'm doing a lot of stuff both on the internet,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.320]   but also in solar energy.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.680]   I have a dream that we can get solar energy
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.960]   to be less expensive than fossil fuels.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.200]   It's not an easy challenge, but it's a very important one.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.160]   So I'm working very, very hard on that as well.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.120]   And where do you make the improvements in the efficiency
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.360]   on solar cells?
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.480]   Well, it's both efficiency and its cost.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.400]   And it's reducing the balance of system costs,
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.200]   it's reducing all kinds of things to make it lower
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.120]   than fossil fuels.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.520]   Fossil fuels are so cheap, because you just dig them out
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.920]   of the ground and burn them.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   But we're going to run out this century,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.760]   and it's either going to be pretty or ugly.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.680]   And if we can come up with a cost-effective solution,
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.160]   we can make it be pretty and not ugly.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.520]   And I'm hoping I can be a part of that.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.400]   And one of the great things I saw this morning
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.680]   in the tour of the building, besides it's being a great space
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.440]   where you just feel creative all around.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.880]   And you know the ghosts of companies that are here,
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.640]   but he has a physical shop where they actually make things.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's so innocent.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   What all of them?
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.040]   Well, we have a full CNC machine shop
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.640]   that we make available to all the companies.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.720]   Not all the companies use it.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.600]   Obviously some of them use our servers
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.160]   and not our CNC milling machine.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.120]   But we try and make it available so that every company
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.160]   in the building can prototype rapidly,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.760]   focus more on its customer,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.800]   and not on the mechanics of getting things done.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.360]   And it's just one of the philosophies that we have
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   that's paid off very well for us.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   Really great.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.640]   It's so good to talk to you, Bill.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.480]   Oh, same here.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.320]   Thank you so much.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.480]   I admire what you're doing so much.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.720]   It's such an honor to be on your show.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.280]   Oh, my.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.880]   I feel exactly the same.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.760]   I'd be a lab.com.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.080]   But if you go to BillGross.com, guess where it takes you?
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.200]   It takes you to the Google.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.000]   Thank you, Bill.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.560]   Great to talk to you.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.760]   And thank you, Jeff.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.120]   That's it.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.880]   Once again, Jeff Jarvis with the big score.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.800]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.320]   Jeff Jarvis and Kevin Marks are here.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.840]   We're talking about Google+.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   But enough of that.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.800]   I got to find out what you think of the Murdoch.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.320]   The B-Sky B Initiative, Dead, News of the World, Dead.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.360]   Is Rupert Murdoch finally?
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   How could we put this?
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.880]   Is he finally defanged?
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.560]   Is he toast?
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.520]   We'll talk about it in just a bit before we do.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.320]   Let me tell you about backup real quickly.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.120]   I want to talk about carbonite.com.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:13.520]   You know what?
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.280]   My friend Peter Krogh, we've got to get him.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.680]   I think we're going to get him on Twitter very soon.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.520]   He's just a great photographer, but also the author
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.600]   of a book called the Digital Asset Management Book.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.680]   This is something every photographer
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.280]   has to deal with.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.560]   How do you protect your assets?
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.240]   Cover your assets, as you might say.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.160]   And of course, it's all about good backups.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   He coined the term, 321 backup.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.040]   And I constantly refer to that when I'm talking about backups.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.320]   And let me just tell you the 321 backup strategy.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.520]   Then I'll tell you how carbonite fits into the app.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.640]   321 means three copies of everything.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.520]   That could be the original and two copies.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   But if you delete the original, then you've lost.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.240]   So you have to have three copies.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.000]   I see how your people make one backup, then delete the original
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.040]   and say, but I'm backed up.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.680]   No, that's one copy.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.200]   You've got to have three copies of everything.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.120]   Two of them on different media.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.160]   So don't put everything on a USB key or an external hard drive
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.520]   because that's not going to do it.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.840]   And finally, and this is the most important,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.440]   one of them has to be off site.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.600]   If there's a disaster and you've done the 321,
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.040]   well, yeah, well, see, I have a DVD here.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.560]   I've got an external hard drive here,
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.600]   and I've got my original on the computer.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.480]   I've got 32.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.920]   And then there's a fire, you've lost them all.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.960]   Somebody comes and steals everything, you've lost them all.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.840]   You've got to have the offsite backup.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.680]   Now, there's no easier way to fulfill the requirements of 3.2.1
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.800]   than carbonite.com.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.440]   Yes, continue to make your local copy.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.480]   That's great.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.040]   That's easy.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.720]   It's fast.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.640]   It's right there.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.680]   I carry USB keys around with me.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.440]   That's good.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   But that offsite backup, carbonite.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.240]   Here's what happens.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.600]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.920]   Install it on your PC or Mac.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.280]   It's free for the first two weeks.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.200]   No credit card or anything.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.080]   Just use the offer code Twig.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.120]   Immediately starts using your internet connection
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.040]   to backup your data.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.120]   And once that full backup set is done--
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.800]   and by the way, carbonite charges one flat rate
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.720]   for all the data on your internal drive.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.920]   Once that backup is done, then it's continually backing up
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.840]   whenever you're online.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.720]   If it's a laptop, it's really good for a laptop.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.520]   Because when you carry around a laptop,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.000]   the whole world is in there, right?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.840]   But carbonite, whenever you're in an access point,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.200]   whenever you're at home, it's backing up,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.240]   backing up, backing up.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.360]   And keeps you backed up.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.560]   That data is available anywhere.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.440]   It's true cloud storage.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.400]   You can log on to your carbonite account from any PC or Mac.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.120]   There's your stuff.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.600]   They even have an Android application, a BlackBerry app,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.320]   an iPhone app.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.840]   So you can only see your data.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.280]   And should the worst happen, restore
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.360]   is as simple as logging in your carbonite account
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.760]   and pressing the restore button.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.120]   It's a good way to move to a new computer, for instance.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.640]   So here's the deal.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.160]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.720]   When you decide to buy-- and I know you will,
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.160]   because it's such a good solution.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.000]   This is great for kids going off to college.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.560]   That's what I did with my daughter's laptop.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.760]   It's great for any device that isn't like a Chromebook,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.840]   that actually has data on it.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.040]   When you decide to buy, use the offer code Twig.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.320]   It's $59 for a year, unlimited for a year.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.440]   But you'll get 14 months of the price of 12
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.000]   when you use the offer code Twig.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.440]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.320]   Do it right with carbonite.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.640]   Offer code TWIG.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.560]   So we've talked a little bit about this whole pre-texting
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.360]   scandal.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.760]   It looks like not--
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.440]   interesting, it's not just the sun and the nerves
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.680]   of the world, which are Rupert Murdoch's two big tabloids
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.560]   in the UK.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.600]   But is the times also involved in this?
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.320]   Not really known yet, or even though the sun is fully known yet.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.440]   Part of the problem with reporting things in the UK
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.320]   is that you can't report criminal activity too early
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.000]   in the process to prejudice the trial.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.720]   But there is an investigation they've hauled in a bunch of people.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.320]   Yes.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   Yes.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   And it's kind of been admitted by some, right?
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.400]   That they were checking people's voicemails by hacking.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.840]   Hacking's the wrong word to use.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.240]   Guessing the hacking.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.440]   It is.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.240]   The hackers get mad at it because it's simple.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.320]   Why don't you explain how it was done?
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.520]   Well, you said pre-texting.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.840]   So that's where you use social engineering to call up
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.040]   and get a password or get some information.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.440]   But we were talking with Steve Gibson, our security guy,
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:08.800]   earlier.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.560]   And he said also, the fact is on a lot of these voicemail
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.200]   accounts, yours too, and mine too,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.240]   there's a default remote access pin, which is often 1, 2, 3, 4,
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.880]   0, 0, 0, 0, or at least in my case, on many of my phones,
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   the last four digits of the phone number, all of which are known.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.720]   If you have the phone number, it's easy.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.200]   And what they would do is one reporter
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.120]   would call the number so that they tied up the line.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.720]   So it would go to the voicemail line.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.480]   And the other one would do the pre-texting.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.960]   Amazing.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.080]   Now, it's not that it's so hard or so clever or so sophisticated.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.680]   It's just that it's unethical as hell.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.560]   It's evil.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.160]   It's awful.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:46.600]   It's awful.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.480]   And it was done to report it as many 4,000 people,
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.360]   including the family of a murdered girl who was then
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.000]   thought to be missing, including the families
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.200]   of dead soldiers in Iraq.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.440]   In some cases, erased these emails of voicemail.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.640]   They erased the emails on the dead girl's account
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.120]   so that more would be left so they'd have more material.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.520]   Royals, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's account,
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.960]   they tried to get the medical records of his child.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.000]   I mean, it's just really--
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.400]   It's truly abhorrent.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.960]   And what's fascinating about it is--
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.600]   I wrote my little poem on plus the story
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.000]   that Humpty Dumpty sat on a paywall.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.080]   Humpty Dumpty had a great bail.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.800]   All the things courses and all the things men are now
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.160]   trying to fry him like an omelet.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.520]   And what's fascinating is that Murdoch was the one who
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.680]   built the biggest institution of some would say,
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.480]   quotes around it, air quotes around journalism,
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.560]   around news of anybody.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.800]   He created this institutional behemoth.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.480]   It had a very cozy relationship in the government media complex.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.400]   That was the other thing, his bribes and--
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.440]   Oh, police.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.400]   And he was warned by the Guardian explicitly
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.800]   not to hire the former editor of News of the World
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.560]   as his spokesman and Cameron Rather, and he did.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.240]   So the connections between the Murdoch Empire and government
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.960]   were very tight and cozy.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.760]   And Murdoch himself is bringing it down.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.400]   I mean, the company itself is bringing itself down.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.240]   So they, as you all know, they closed the News of the World,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.920]   which was a fairly abhorrent, but large, tabloid.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.280]   They wanted to buy B Sky B, which was a huge prize.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.840]   Murdoch only owns 39% of it.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.440]   And all of Parliament was proposed by the Liberals.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.560]   But the Conservatives, the government
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.800]   had to come in behind too.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.320]   And they would have voted today to urge him to drop the bid.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.920]   So before that, he dropped the bid,
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   which is a huge impact on the company.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.960]   People ask what the impact is going to be in the US
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.160]   for our US listeners.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.320]   He owns Fox News, the Dow Jones folks, who
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.640]   publish the Wall Street Journal.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.120]   I think there's a chance--
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.680]   and this is only speculation.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.480]   This is not a prediction.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   But after I wrote this on Monday, the Financial Times
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.560]   and Felix Salmon Reuters and others
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   came in, John Gapper at the FT, came in and sang the same thing.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.920]   I think that News Corp may have to get out of the news business.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.000]   Because if all your war is an entertainment executive,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.200]   then you're known to be rapacious.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.760]   That's not necessarily a big deal.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.840]   I'm not allowed to be a shark.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.680]   You're selling programming.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.320]   But the fact that he brings now such kudos to the news business
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.840]   and brings such presentation.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.600]   Why blame Rupert Murdoch for this?
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   Is he really to blame for this?
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.800]   Because he's management.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.480]   The buck stops there.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.160]   He's created a culture where this was encouraged.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.480]   Yeah, encouraged.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.800]   But I want to be careful about that.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.840]   Because let me say, because I know right now there
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.640]   are listeners of the show who get mad at me who are now
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.680]   between way any second.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.760]   I'm not a stock Murdoch basher.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.440]   I worked for the company at a TV guide.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.560]   I want to say very loudly that I got no editorial interference
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:49.800]   there.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.600]   I got lots of editorial interference at Timek.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.520]   The thing about the company is to know
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.600]   is it's very Australian, very seated
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.880]   to pants, very decentralized.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.000]   I think the culture is not so much the Rupert,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.280]   though he loves to find out what's on one of his papers
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.200]   and deal with that.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.280]   The culture is, let's do something that'll
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.360]   please the boss.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.080]   Let's do something that I know that they'll like this.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.040]   And it's that kind of culture.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.760]   It's not that he orders--
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.480]   It maintains the disability.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.960]   So, Kevin, you must be somewhat of an observer on this.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.440]   It's funny, because this story is only now gaining traction
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.040]   in the US in the last week.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:25.360]   Right.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.720]   Big story in the UK for some time.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.680]   Well, it's been bubbling under for years.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   It's the thing that the Guardian have been sort of digging
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.720]   away at this and that the phone hacking stuff,
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.000]   they had a court case in 2006 or '07, wasn't it, Jeff?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.480]   So this is not all new stuff.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.120]   It's just that they've actually brought up some more allegations.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.240]   But the other piece of this that has been a sea change
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.280]   is that the political candidates were all carried by this.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.360]   They were worried that if the sun went against them,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.400]   they'd lose the next election.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.640]   Exactly.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.000]   And so they would go soft on the news international papers
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:50:59.800]   and that stuff.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.280]   But what happened over the last two weeks
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.320]   is that there was a massive online backlash against this.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.760]   I mean, a campaign to get advertisers to withdraw
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   their advertising for the news of the world.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.800]   And that was, I think, a big part of what
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.040]   caused this to tip back over and become
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.400]   a massive cause for WebRiggan.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.120]   And so a lot of these allegations
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.280]   have been around for a long time.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.200]   Interesting.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.400]   Tom Watson, MP, who's someone I know
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.040]   through the open rights group, has been talking about this
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.400]   for years and being told to shut up by his party and so on.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.920]   And now the questions that he asked in Parliament
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.800]   and the things being brought up in the news stories.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.560]   So it's like the institutions are sort of actually
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.960]   working as they're supposed to now,
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.600]   but they have to get kicked into it by a sort of online campaign.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.280]   Yeah, the Guardian has done spectacular work on this story.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.600]   A friend of mine is over in UK now,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.080]   and he feels very Watergate time like there.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.280]   And it's really quite amazing.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.160]   How much of this is shot in Freud, though, on the Guardian's part?
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.560]   Oh, no, this is hard.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.600]   Oh, they're delighted.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.800]   But this is very hard work.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.560]   As Kevin says, they went after it and after it.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.480]   Nick Davies, the reporter who is also
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.520]   the one who convinced Assange to give him the Wiki of the Exdata.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.960]   Davies is the brilliant kind of reporter,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.040]   Alan Russ Berger, the editor of the Guardian,
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.600]   and full disclosure is our right for the Guardian,
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.480]   said in a wonderful video,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.520]   I sawing up last week that this was a week
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.640]   of the worst of journalism.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.400]   Let's remember also the best of journals.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   The fear that I have is that the media in the news media
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.200]   in the UK are regulated non-TV by the press complaints
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.240]   commission, which is a private organization.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.200]   There's going to be a push to bring government regulation
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.040]   to news media.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:37.040]   I, my American, quasi-libertarian soul, just poor that idea.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.240]   And I think it's the wrong thing to do.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.320]   And I think the real truth here is that the readers
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.400]   are your regulators.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.560]   The government proved to be a terrible regulator.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.440]   The government is part of the corruption
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   from police up to number 10.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.760]   And so the best thing we can do is to open up journalism more,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.160]   to more people.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.960]   Craig Newmark and I talked last week.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.080]   His hobby horse right now is fact checking.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.600]   And I wonder how to make that scale.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.520]   So you don't just have--
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.200]   - I think there are a lot of out of work fact checkers
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.360]   who are glad to hear that.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.360]   - Oh yeah, there's business.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.280]   There is business.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.320]   And so why shouldn't every news story
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.560]   have a fact check box on it?
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.680]   The New York Times does--
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.960]   - We could crowdsource it now.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.200]   - That's right, crowdsource it now.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.040]   - You could start to do that.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.880]   Not to the end.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.360]   - You could hand over all the work to them.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.760]   A crowd could not do what Nick Davies did.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.040]   Absolutely not.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.760]   But the crowd can dig in documents,
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.040]   the crowd can fact check things,
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.080]   the crowd can raise questions about things,
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.240]   the politicians say in journalism.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.760]   - Doesn't that mean that we don't really need to do this anymore?
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.400]   Because as soon as you publish a story,
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.480]   the hordes will jump on it and start to pick it apart.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.240]   And if there's a problem, they'll find it.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.560]   - Well don't you find that truly out there?
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.960]   - Yeah, so we'll say anything wrong.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.800]   - Right.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.520]   - It's certainly true for us.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.080]   - And the difference is the attitude about that.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.320]   The attitude that you have is thank you.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.160]   - Right.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.960]   All right, let's move on.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.720]   I think that we've covered that.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.360]   It isn't technically a Google subject,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.480]   but because Jeff is such a student-observer.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.200]   - It ultimately made it a little cloud either.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.400]   - You did, you did a good job.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.920]   You got to cloudify it.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.160]   Oh gosh, there's so much to talk about going on here.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.800]   That's not Google+, I'm gonna try to skip ahead.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.160]   Google offers rolls out in more markets,
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.560]   including here in the San Francisco Bay Area in New York City.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.360]   Got my new Google Shoper 2.0 with Google offers.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.520]   Strange offer.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:29.640]   One of the local restaurants is offering $100 off on a education.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.440]   I think there's a mistake in here,
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.640]   but otherwise it's already,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.560]   they've already got quite a few offers
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.800]   in my small little town of Petaluma.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.640]   - Really?
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.400]   - Yeah, so that means that the government says--
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.680]   - Are they manicurish or are they better than that?
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.880]   - No, they're not bad.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.800]   So here's Kuchina Paradisa offering $100 off my tuition
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.120]   at the Italian restaurant down the street.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.600]   Papa John's Pizza, Bistro Chabor, Sabor, Free Churros,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.480]   Los Arcos, Free Coffee Super Deal,
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.320]   that's in Santa Rosa.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.160]   See, these are local.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.200]   I guess they've been doing this for longer than that's eat.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.360]   Let's see what play is.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.600]   Yeah, and here's the,
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.920]   here's some $1,500 off of Lacey.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.400]   - That's an impressive number.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.920]   - $1,500?
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.080]   - No, no, no, no, no,
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.440]   even in Petaluma, the whole Petaluma.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.400]   - Little Petaluma. - Little Petaluma.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.040]   - Taekwondo, Free First Class,
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.080]   Kame Mail Center, $2 off Notary Public Charges.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.400]   - I'll bet all those businesses
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.840]   have claimed their place pages,
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.600]   and that's Google's low hanging fruit.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.120]   - Ah, you know, there is a little place button
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:32.960]   that shows up.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   - That's why then.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   - Yeah, that's what they said they were gonna do,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.640]   and that's what they're doing.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.760]   And so now they have something else
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.300]   to sell the six million businesses
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.480]   that have claimed their place pages.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.200]   - Places, I think there's no reason not to do a place page.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.720]   That's just such an obvious.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.960]   - You know, it's not unlike,
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.440]   I'm sorry, not to go back to plus,
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.800]   but it's not unlike how they're making
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.000]   the profile page canonical for people.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   They want the place page to be canonical for the business.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.840]   - Right.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   So Google offers now in Austin, Boston, Denver,
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.160]   New York City, Uptown, downtown and Midtown, Oakland, East Bay,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.640]   Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.120]   - New York City, the one so big we need three of them.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.960]   (laughs)
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.560]   - Uptown, downtown, and Midtown.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:08.920]   I'm not going downtown right there.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.880]   - But no San Jose, Dan.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.440]   - No San Jose, well, I wonder if San Francisco
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.320]   means the whole Bay area, let's see.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.040]   Oh, wait a minute, you know what, I was wrong.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.880]   So I was looking at--
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.320]   - So how do I look?
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.880]   - You have to go have the new Google shopper,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   which just came out 2.0.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.320]   And then there is, then you have to subscribe,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.800]   and it looks like there actually is nothing
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.080]   to buy in Petaluma right now.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.000]   So whatever these other deals were--
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.840]   - Off.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.720]   - That's interesting.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.120]   - They were Bay area deals?
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.480]   - No, they were in the Bay,
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.280]   I don't understand the difference between that
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.240]   and Google offers, but apparently there are offers.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.480]   I don't know why.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.520]   There are some, there's, I don't know.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.640]   I don't know, maybe it's somebody at Google
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   can explain what the difference is between offers
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.320]   and offers, but apparently there is a difference.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.840]   I'll honor their offer, and it'll be honor
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.840]   and offer all night.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.320]   Moving right along, Google.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.160]   (laughs)
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.000]   - Let's keep going.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.560]   (laughs)
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.960]   - Jeff Jarvis said that.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.280]   - No I didn't.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.640]   I just say everything else bad, but I didn't say that.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.160]   - Old jokes.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:16.640]   - Cold joke, she offered her honor, he honored her offer,
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.440]   and was honor and offer all night.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:22.720]   Google Voice had spam filters.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.240]   Let solicitors get caught in the web.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.960]   Another good reason to use Google Voice.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.680]   You can actually filter out the call you don't want.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.120]   - Of course, with a regular phone, that's called,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.560]   do not call.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.320]   - Yeah, but it doesn't work.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.920]   - No, but they had this before, right?
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.600]   They had numbers that were known to be solicitors,
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.840]   and then you could then block them.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.920]   - Really?
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.760]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.480]   - So it's like a chismet for phone calling.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   - So it's creating a spam folder
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.280]   for phone calls, texts, and voicemails.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.160]   The company's servers use collected data
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.760]   from other users marking similar messages as spam,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.000]   as well as proprietary identification tools
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.800]   to help ensure that those generic creditor
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.360]   or vacation sweepstakes calls never make it to your phone.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.920]   I love that idea.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.000]   - Yeah. - It's a shame we need it.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.520]   Because you're supposed to be able to say,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.640]   and I try this all the time with solicitors,
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.120]   please add me to your do not call list.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:18.960]   - Right.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.360]   - The problem is many of these solicitations
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.600]   now are coming from outside the US,
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.880]   and they go, "I do not know what that list is."
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.200]   - Well, the great thing about the easiest signal you have
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.920]   is you've been with the phone and you say hello,
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.680]   and if there's a 15 second beat,
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.760]   you know what it is. - Yeah, right.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.480]   It's the phone room. - The phone room.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.160]   Oh, we got one, we got a live one quick.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.000]   - Right.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   - Android Market has been updated.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.280]   Do you want to show, I don't have it yet on my phone.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.840]   Apparently, it's being rolled out.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.160]   - So I try it on here, okay.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.960]   - Yeah, look, it's beautiful.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.240]   - I was looking at the four square offers name me.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.080]   That was my...
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.880]   - Ah, four square also has offers.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.360]   In fact, four square did this whole update
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.720]   to their Android app that makes it superior to the iPhone app.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.240]   - Oh. - This is just the beginning.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.360]   I think you're going to start seeing
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.200]   as Android grows really fast,
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.120]   it's just what happened with Windows and Mac.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.400]   Increasingly, people are going to go to Android first,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.040]   and I'm starting to see that in a number of ways,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.720]   including this four square app where they put notifications
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.440]   in and some other features that are not yet an iPhone.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.000]   Of course, Google did it themselves with the Apple.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.840]   - Is this the Apple? - It's the Apple one,
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.240]   - That's the old one, you want to see the new one?
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.040]   - Yeah. - Okay, rub your eyes, get ready.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.560]   This is so exciting, ladies and gentlemen, this!
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.680]   (imitates phone ringing)
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.800]   Is the new market.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.120]   And it includes movies and books.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.200]   - Books.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.040]   Now what's going to happen?
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.880]   - And Google Books, is it just integrated?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.000]   Go out, okay, I'm in apps right now, let's go to market.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.520]   Apps, games, books, movies.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.320]   I mean, it totally looks different.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.040]   This, by the way, is the nicest phone for Android,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.840]   but you can't get it in the US yet.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.880]   It's Samsung's Galaxy 2S, and--
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.760]   - Ah! - Oh, is it, is it, is it,
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.160]   beuuteous, it's not mine, I wish it were, it's Eileen's.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.200]   She, of course, has to have the latest and greatest.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.720]   But it's just really sweet.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.040]   - Android lady.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.480]   - She's an Android lady, so let's look
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.520]   at Little Red Riding Hood.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.240]   Oh, this is a movie, so I can rent this for $3.99.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.440]   Watch it on my phone, or I presume tablet,
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.560]   if I've paid for it.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.120]   It's got reviews, it's got related.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.680]   - Nicely done.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.320]   That's really new for them.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.160]   - Yeah.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.000]   - 'Cause that was one of the problems
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.840]   is they didn't have the net flexibility,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   so now they have their own net flex.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.680]   - Yeah.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.560]   - The question is, do they have any good movies?
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.160]   - Well, they have Little Red Riding Hood.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.320]   - Well.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.240]   (laughing)
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.920]   ♪ Hey there, little red riding hood ♪
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.920]   - So, Little Eileen Rivera, who has the best phone
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.320]   in the market, also then says to me,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.320]   "And can I get the new Amazon tablet when it comes out?"
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.640]   - Is it Android?
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.160]   - Yes, honestly it is.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.200]   - Well, I think she has a rumor, right?
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.280]   - This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.520]   Amazon, I mean, I suppose that makes it a credible rumor.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.760]   Journal seems to do pretty well.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.640]   I think people leak stuff to the journal.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.920]   Amazon plans tablet by October.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.440]   The Seattle-based company will release two updated versions
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.600]   of its Kindle electronic reader as well
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.120]   in the third quarter when we'll be a touchscreen device.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.440]   The other will not be touchscreen,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.520]   but with a proved and cheaper adaptation
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.600]   of the current Kindle.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.880]   Amazon, of course, not commenting.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.960]   This is a rumor.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.920]   The Amazon tablet, according to the journal,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.520]   will have a nine-inch screen.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.400]   It will run on Android.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.760]   It will not have a camera,
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.600]   said one person familiar with it.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.320]   But it will watch, allow Amazon customers to watch videos,
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.080]   read e-books and listen to digital music
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.640]   they purchase or rent from Amazon.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.760]   - I'm presuming they're not gonna limit it to their tablets.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.440]   So, anything you can do on Android,
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   you can do from Amazon.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.560]   - Yeah, that's what they want.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.840]   - Yeah, there also is a $139 version of the Kindle now,
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.160]   the 3G Kindle, 139 is the lowest 3G they've ever offered.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.360]   But you get ads from AT&T, I guess it is.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.040]   - So, the advantage to Amazon
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.720]   to having its own tablet is what?
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.800]   - Same, I would guess, same advantage.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.520]   Apple has owning the iPad,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.280]   they own the ecosystem, right?
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.120]   - Well, there's two things to this.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.440]   I mean, one is that it means they get to put their app store
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.640]   on it as the default one.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.120]   - Right. - Right.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   - And that means that they can sell,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.440]   not just books and media,
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.080]   but also apps through their system,
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.640]   which is something, you know, at the moment,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.400]   installing their app store is a major pain
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.600]   on the Google ones.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.880]   - Yeah, you have to go to a URL and...
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.040]   - Yeah.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.840]   - The other piece of this is that the Nook is doing very well
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.840]   for Barnes and Noble.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.240]   There was one of the stories that it was...
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.320]   - That's interesting, it's competitive.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.120]   - Top e-reader, yeah. - Yeah, it does.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.760]   - And that started out as a sort of, you know,
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.680]   lockdown Android that would only let you read books
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.240]   and they said, "Oh, let's let people
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.080]   install apps too."
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.600]   And suddenly, you got a $250 tablet
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.680]   that people actually want.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.320]   And they've got a lot of salespeople
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.000]   who are really magazines and things on it.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.720]   And because they're selling it through the store.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.800]   - The speculation is though,
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.600]   that Nook's doing so well
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.200]   because it's color.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.360]   - Right, well, it's part of it.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.280]   But the other part of it is that they have,
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.960]   you know, they have physical presence to sell it.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.800]   So they have a lot of people that exist in it.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.640]   - Yeah, they have a sale at the store.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.840]   - You could see before you buy.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.120]   - They've got a hawker right up there
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.040]   pushing it hard.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.160]   - Right.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.840]   - For the first time ever,
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.560]   the Nook color is the number one leading e-reader sales
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.600]   for the first time ever.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.440]   - Oh.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.760]   - The other thing that's somewhat related
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.240]   is the Philadelphia Inquirer is thinking about selling,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.400]   is selling/giving away a tablet
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.560]   with long-term subscription.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.880]   Well, yeah, it reminds me,
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.560]   it reminds me of the early days of the web
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.840]   where a lot of these people, companies Night Ritter,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.600]   decided they had to be ISPs.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.840]   - Right.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.320]   - And they started an ISP for dial-up
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.960]   and it seemed to make sense, but then again, it doesn't.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.520]   It makes it seem that what you're a delivery business
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.160]   rather than your content business relationship business.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.760]   And so thinking you have to, you know,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.360]   get people on tablets, I don't know.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.480]   - But it's a reasonable bundle business to do, right?
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.040]   - It does make sense, doesn't it?
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.520]   - Right, you know, you get promotions
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.440]   when you subscribe to things and they send you something
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.400]   that's sort of vaguely related.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.240]   This is something that's actually really related.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.080]   - It's better than a toast, yeah.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.280]   - And if it is actually not some ridiculously locked down
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.840]   device, but an actual one that you can sell other things on,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.240]   you know, if it's like one of these, you know,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.080]   these type ones that are actually quite nice,
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.640]   then people will be attracted to that.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.600]   - It does sniff a smell of desperation a little bit though.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.440]   - I think it does.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.960]   - What price point do you think tablet,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.720]   you know, a don't call it a seven, don't call it a 10,
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.280]   a nine inch tablet will get two and two years?
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:28.960]   - Hmm.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.480]   - Hmm, what's the subsidy cost?
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.600]   - I think we're talking a hundred, 150.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.240]   - So a wholesale cost, yeah.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.400]   - I mean, I mean, I mean,
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.520]   - I mean, I cost already have some ones in that range.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.000]   - Our cost is doing stuff, yeah.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.400]   But they're also saving money in various ways,
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.120]   but yes, they're offering very inexpensive Android tablets.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   - I saw Nicholas Degerponti at an event
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.560]   at Harvard three weeks ago and at the Berkman Center
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.480]   and he said what comes next for one laptop per child
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.000]   is one tablet.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.840]   - They're trying.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.480]   - They realize that they,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.240]   (laughing)
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.080]   by the way, speaking of one laptop per child,
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.600]   how many of you are using your Chromebook on a regular basis?
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.880]   - I don't have one 'cause I didn't get offered one by you.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.280]   - Oh, Mr. Marks has one.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.400]   - See it right now, I've got it as sitting here with,
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.600]   yeah, I've got the tweak episode guide up on it
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.360]   when I'm looking at that as my second screen.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.640]   - Does it have anything to offer
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.040]   that makes it superior to a standard netbook?
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.600]   - It's just a netbook, right?
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.760]   - It's not running Windows, that's a superior.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.120]   - It's more secure, although I don't know
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.040]   if you can look at it and say, well, that feels more secure.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.960]   - Well, you can, I mean, you can do the,
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.560]   you know, you can do the account switching thing.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.400]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.360]   - Should I do that?
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.760]   - It was so cool, I flew Virgin America yesterday
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.120]   and I'm not in my short haul, but on the long haul.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   - They give you Samsung.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.280]   - That's so amazing.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.120]   - Yeah.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.680]   - By the way, Amazon is now offering
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.200]   unlimited cloud music storage,
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.280]   much like Google is at least on its beta
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.120]   and Apple plans to with iCloud.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.160]   You still have to, you have to buy
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.100]   a cloud drive storage plan.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.800]   So I'm not sure how, it's not free,
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.440]   but so if you don't pay for anything,
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   you'd ever buy nothing, you get five gigs for free.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.640]   - So what's the best strategic advantage to have?
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.800]   Three choices.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   Cloud account, what are you showing us there, Kevin?
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.480]   - So I was showing the multiple login screens actually nice.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.840]   - They needed that actually.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.640]   - This is the piece that you don't have on the iPad
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.480]   that you need and you don't have on the other tablets
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.720]   or any of the other devices.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.440]   Which is we can all log in with our Google accounts,
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.280]   it pops up and turns into our machine
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.320]   and then we talk about the go away again.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.960]   And so it becomes as a sort of family lying around
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.840]   computing device is actually really handy for that.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.080]   - Do you think that web apps though compete with
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.680]   standalone apps, do you really think people?
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.000]   - Yeah, well, it depends what you do.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.360]   - Yeah, for a lot of what I do, I'm reading stuff on the web,
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.320]   I'm writing documents in Google Docs, I'm doing Gmail,
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.760]   I'm, you know, I bought into that when I joined the company
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.360]   and I've stuck with it.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.960]   And it's the same with Salesforce,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.520]   I was this very web based as well,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.800]   so you can run a lot of your stuff on there.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.440]   What I found for my wife, I gave, I let her log in,
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.960]   tried out and she was like, yeah, I could use this,
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.600]   my mostly surf the web, do email.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.040]   - I think my wife would like it too.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.840]   - It does what she needs to do.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.280]   - Exactly, I mean, if you are right,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.080]   code is not the machine you want.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.480]   - You want to write that edit video,
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.320]   it's not the one.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.600]   - You want to edit videos, it's not the machine you want.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.440]   - Anything more serious.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.880]   - It runs, hang out quite nicely,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.200]   that works on it pretty well.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.040]   - Really?
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.360]   - Yeah.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.560]   - I think education and companies,
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.640]   it makes a great deal of sense.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.920]   - Yeah, so we were talking about, I'm sorry,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.240]   we interrupted you, Jeff, on the Amazon cloud.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.640]   - Oh, never mind, I'm just gonna go off on that.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.880]   (laughing)
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.240]   - You know, I think the advantage Amazon has over Google
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.160]   is that they sell crap.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.240]   I mean, Google, I mean, so it makes sense
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.480]   that if I buy a song and it's now instantly in my cloud,
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.320]   that's nice. - Yes.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.720]   - I wish I could go. - What I was gonna ask was this,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.080]   what's the bigger advantage strategically?
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.640]   - Owning, having a cloud,
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.200]   telling somebody, owning the browser,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.600]   or owning the hardware.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.480]   - Oh, well, that's germane to our Chrome discussion.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.320]   - Yes.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.160]   - Hmm.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.320]   - I think, I mean, the point of the browser,
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.160]   you don't need to earn it.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.360]   So I think owning the browser is,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.200]   it's a necessary to have browser competition
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.600]   which is why they built Chrome.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.440]   But they don't have to own the browser
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.280]   to make it magic and special.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   I think that's, you know, the thing that,
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.880]   there's some little things that this does nicely,
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.280]   where the G chat is integrated to the system,
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   so it pops up over all the browser windows
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.160]   and, you know, bits pieces like that.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.120]   But there's nothing special that nobody else
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.920]   that anyone else couldn't have done too.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.120]   And the point is that the browsers are standard enough now
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.440]   that you can write stuff and it will work
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.760]   across a broad range of devices.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.720]   You're not focused on one particular browser anymore.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.120]   I was hacking up on, there was that thing about
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.440]   slope graphs.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.400]   So last night I've hacked around
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.200]   writing a slope graph generator.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.760]   And then, you know, it runs on,
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.080]   my free browser's on here.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   It runs on the Chromebook.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.720]   It runs on the two tablets.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.920]   It runs on my son's PC-ish.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.240]   So, that was not, you know,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.760]   me not spending lots of time trying to test it.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.520]   It was just like, I'll just use this library,
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.880]   write some code that draws some graphics,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.280]   puts it up on the screen using SVG,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.880]   and it actually works across a
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.840]   quite a broad range of different devices.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.160]   And that's the, you know,
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.360]   that is the promise of the web platform.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.960]   So owning the browser isn't something
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.520]   that you need to do as a corporation,
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.720]   but it's a valuable thing as a sort of infrastructure services.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.240]   There's a reason Apple had to build a browser's
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.160]   because they weren't relying on someone else for that.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.480]   And it's similar for Google to do that.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.280]   But now those two have done that.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.240]   We've got four competing ones.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.600]   You can choose one and bundle it.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.680]   You don't need to, you don't need to make that investment again.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.520]   Amazon doesn't need to make that investment again.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   And it's kind of the same with that.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.000]   - Facebook.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.640]   - And Facebook doesn't need to make the investment again.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.200]   You know, they run across browsers
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.960]   that they've got a nice choice of
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.400]   different source ones that they could do.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.080]   They could customize one perhaps,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.840]   but they don't really need to.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.520]   And, you know, if you look at the way they've built the apps,
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.200]   they are relying more on the browser than on native apps.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.880]   And certainly for iPad and even for Android.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.640]   - So to answer your question though,
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.440]   I think really none of them are sufficient.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.560]   I mean, probably it's better if you go,
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.320]   I had to pick one of the three to own the cloud,
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.200]   but what you really want to own is you want to own
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.320]   the ecosystem, the chain.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.560]   You want to own, which Amazon's in very good position to do.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.000]   You buy it from Amazon, it's stored on the cloud on Amazon.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   It sits on your Amazon tablet,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.760]   but it also works with any other device.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.520]   That's really, I think, isn't that where you want to be
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.360]   if you had a choice?
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.480]   - I think Amazon is the sleeper in all this.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.680]   That we keep talking about.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.240]   - Well, but it's Amazon versus Apple.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.920]   I mean, really that's what it's going to be.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.440]   And the problem with Apple is it's not open.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.600]   So if you're in the Amazon ecosystem,
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.360]   I mean the Apple ecosystem, you're in and that's it.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.200]   There's your choice.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.320]   You don't have nothing else you can do.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.840]   But Amazon, it's kind of you can use this,
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.880]   but it'll work with other things.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.280]   - I mean, Amazon is not dogmatic about this.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.480]   - They're not dogmatic.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.760]   - They've got Kindle apps and all the devices I've got here.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.960]   Right?
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.680]   - So I think the Amazon's the winner.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.000]   I mean, I hope Amazon's the winner in that respect.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.680]   The only advantage to the Apple model is you can create
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.440]   a kind of a unity of experience that Amazon perhaps,
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.000]   it might be, it's more complicated, perhaps.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.840]   - Right.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.680]   - It requires more attention.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.520]   - I've been going back and forth through the devices
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.360]   so much later.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.720]   You know what drives me nutty about the Android tablet?
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.600]   And otherwise I love it.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.240]   - Is the correction?
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.560]   The typing correction.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.200]   - Yeah, they don't have a very good,
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.120]   iPhone has a much better system for that.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.200]   - I'm trying to see them out on the iPhone.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.880]   So I like swipe on the Android
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.520]   and I wish that Android tablet had swipe.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.360]   - Yes, well, swipe.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.200]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.040]   - It comes to keyboard.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.880]   - It comes to keyboard.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.720]   - When it comes to keyboard.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.320]   - There's a taste thing there as well.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.640]   This is also like the Matt versus Windows fonts thing.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.480]   - Well, no, no, no.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.920]   - It's the one, the other version itself.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.160]   - But he's talking about the selection
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.880]   where you get that little wedge,
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.240]   those wedges that look like a vice.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.520]   I put my text in a vice.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.640]   You're talking about that thing, right?
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.520]   - That piece?
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.960]   - Yeah, I hate that thing.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.000]   And Apple's got the magnifying glass, which is so elegant.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.520]   - But also the words it gives me.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.880]   If I start typing it in a word.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.400]   - Well, that's keyboard specific, right?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.480]   - It gives me a 20 character word that I've typed before.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.040]   And if I go back, you know, erase one letter,
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.400]   it changes to a whole other word.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.640]   - But that's, but that's, Jeff,
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.040]   that's completely keyboard specific.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.400]   So there's swipe, there's Swift key.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.640]   There's nuance has a very nice one called T9.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.280]   All of them do it differently.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.360]   - Oh.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.320]   - So you should just try some other keyboards.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.720]   And this is a huge advantage for Android.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.560]   I mean, I think this is--
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.400]   - It is.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.240]   - One of them.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.600]   - I don't like swipe, which ones should I use?
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.920]   - I would try, and Amazon offered this for free
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.400]   a few weeks ago, and I really like it.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.480]   Nuance is T9.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.680]   Keyboard.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.720]   Somewhat like Swift key.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.080]   Swift key has a new one in beta
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.000]   that you might take a look at as well.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.840]   What do you like, Eileen Rivera-hosts are all about,
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.440]   Android showed, which keyboard do you use?
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.320]   She likes the Swift key beta.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.440]   That's pretty interesting what they're doing there.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.280]   - I haven't seen another one.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.480]   - It combines tap and swipe and the recommendations,
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.000]   and it learns from what you use.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.560]   One of the things that was cool about Swift key
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.160]   is if you type the same phrase as a lot,
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.560]   it will just, all you have to do is hit space, space, space,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.360]   'cause you know, you type the first letter in the phrase
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.680]   and it goes, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.520]   And you just type space--
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.440]   - I like the electrical layer.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.280]   I like the--
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.560]   - Yeah, it's actually for somebody like me, it's amazing.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.640]   I must be a very repetitive person.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.680]   All right, couple more stories I gotta go.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.760]   Paul Adams, did you know him when you were at Google?
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   - I didn't know him at Google, but I was very impressed
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.040]   with his presentation, he read about that,
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.360]   and I spoke to him since about that.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.400]   So he left Google for Facebook.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.560]   - Right.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.040]   - He did a--
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.280]   - And Google canceled his book.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.600]   - Yeah, well, the thing is he's the guy
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   who kind of came up with that circles stuff,
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.760]   left and went to Facebook,
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.120]   and then he wrote a book called Social Circles,
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.780]   and Google was blocking it.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.400]   Is it that threatening to Google?
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.080]   - I don't know the inside story here,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.760]   but the version I read a bit was that they didn't want him
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.440]   to release this book because it was based on what they
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.760]   then released it, and they wanted to keep Emerald Sea
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.240]   as it then was under cover.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.000]   - But that was before Emerald Sea came out.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.680]   - But that excuse should be gone now,
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.360]   and he said, "Well, if they're still not answering my calls,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.440]   "and yeah, I guess they're kind of busy,
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.600]   "but it doesn't seem great."
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.000]   He says he's writing another book.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.640]   - Is it not the case that,
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.200]   and I'm thinking about Sheryl Sandberg here
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.440]   in the New Yorker profile by Ken Aleda,
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.560]   in which one anonymous Googler said,
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.040]   "She is persona non-Grada here.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.160]   "We feel that she is using her inside knowledge
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.800]   "of Google to give Facebook a leg up."
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.880]   Simple things like, "Google takes three weeks
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.080]   "to approve a new employee, so she made sure
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.360]   "that Facebook took two, giving them a little advantage."
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.400]   - But that's not as sensitive as Google,
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.960]   that's just like being a smart and more efficient
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.800]   than the next one. - That's just smart.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.640]   - It was hiring for us.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.120]   - But apparently, you know better than I,
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:57.200]   but apparently she is like, "Hello, Sheryl."
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.720]   She's not somebody they like much,
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.280]   and I wonder if Paul is in that same boat.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.520]   - He may have got a bit of that.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.880]   I mean, they may have felt, you know,
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.520]   he was, they were encouraging him to publish the book,
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.320]   and then he left, and then they felt
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.480]   it was like their book rather than his.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480]   So then there'd be something like that going on.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   - You're at Facebook now.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.320]   - I hope they're bigger than that.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.120]   They should be really, that's the thing.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.840]   But one of the stuff he said about
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.520]   not paying attention to the social scientists,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.160]   I think that rang very true to me,
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.240]   and I think that's something that has got better.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.000]   And certainly we got a sense of that
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.240]   from the talks you had with Vic and Bradley last week,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.840]   that they're actually paying more attention to that stuff
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.680]   and picking up on that now, which is encouraging,
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.960]   because that was a clear problem that I saw when I was there,
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.640]   that it wasn't just that they weren't paying attention
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.600]   to social scientists, that they didn't actually employ any,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.600]   except by accident.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.640]   You know, they ended up with Yuri Engstrom working there,
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.800]   but that's because they bought his startup,
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.840]   not 'cause they hired him,
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.400]   'cause he understands the sociology of the internet so well.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.200]   And the research group.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.560]   - Even if you go far say,
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.200]   Google sees every social problem
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.160]   as having an engineering solution.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.000]   - Yeah.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.680]   - They are engineers, that's what they do.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.520]   - It's an experiment,
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.040]   if you bought a company entirely composed
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040]   of software engineers, that's Google.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.360]   And to first approximation, there is the end,
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.720]   there's the large sales organization
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.440]   that Cheryl Sandberg put up when she was there
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.640]   and is still doing very well,
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.400]   and it is not all engineers,
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.840]   but all the PM people tend to have computer science degrees
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   in Google as well.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.200]   So it is, and it is, you've read it in the plex,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.960]   it's very data driven, it's very measured,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.880]   and it's not very nuanced on the social science side.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.480]   It's much, I suppose the closest they've got there
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.280]   would be what's his name, the chief economist.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.600]   He's the closest in the question.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.480]   - I was gonna say that, they may not have any,
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.600]   they may be all engineers, but they do have a guy,
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.000]   early on they hired, who's an economist?
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.720]   - Yes, yes, but he's an economist.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.760]   - But he's kind of an engineering,
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.680]   he's kind of an,
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.520]   a kind of attrition economist type.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.360]   - Right.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.200]   - Zuckerberg, when I interviewed him,
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.040]   he made a point of saying that he majored also in psychology.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:03.880]   - Right.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.400]   - And I say in the book, coming out September 26th,
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.320]   that Zuckerberg isn't so much an engineer.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.240]   - I'm an engineer, I'm a social engineer.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.680]   - Yeah, well it's really clear,
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:12.960]   I mean you could see that.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.120]   On the other hand, there is something anodyne
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.240]   about the engineering approach to privacy,
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.440]   it's very clear and something a little creepy
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.360]   about the social science approach to privacy.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.280]   It's much less, it's much more mushy and gushy.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.240]   And I think that's one of the reasons we trust Google,
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.640]   'cause they're engineers.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.240]   - Yeah, well I gave my talk on the value of publicness,
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.160]   but I really concentrate on privacy this week at Google.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.200]   And I'm told that some of the,
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.680]   and it was a great group and funny and wonderful
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.480]   and had a great time, but I'm told that a few of the people
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.160]   who do things like encryption,
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.560]   thought that I was an edge case.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.960]   Because they-- - We all know that.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.160]   - Yeah, what I do, yes I am.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.080]   (laughing)
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.240]   Everybody, you know, I have this problem by the way,
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.880]   and all the Twitch shows,
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.800]   where we just assume we're like real people.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.080]   (laughing)
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.760]   - Well, but that's also, that's Google's problem too.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.800]   It's their presumption is that they are typical.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   And that was the thing that blew up in their faces with buzz
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   because they're not, they're very enormous.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.200]   - And it's by the way, why I like a lot of what they do.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.000]   - Right, of course, you know, they're between things
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.680]   that we're-- - Well, we build
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.880]   for the edge case.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.240]   - We're rich, educated, geeky people living
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.480]   in Silicon Valley, we're exactly--
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.480]   - Stuff for us.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.760]   - And their challenge is to build it for, you know,
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.120]   poor people in the third world as well.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.000]   And that's the piece that they're not thinking about
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.840]   as it goes clearly.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.080]   - But the third people in the poor world should build their own,
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.200]   I mean, the poor people in the third world
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.280]   should build their own damn stuff.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.040]   We're scratching our edge, dammit.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:40.880]   - Well, that's it.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.600]   - Tell them to get their own computers.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.640]   - This is where the open source thing does work.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.680]   You know, that that was happened with Android is that,
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.040]   you know, China and India are using that to build their own
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.160]   work view of how these things should behave rather than Google's one.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.440]   So that piece is valid in that if you build this stuff
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.760]   in a way that other people can remix and rebuild it,
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.440]   they all do interesting stuff with it.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.560]   And that's one of the pieces that's one of the narrative friends
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.360]   this week that was this, mainly slightly nervous,
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.040]   was the combination of no longer indexing Twitter.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.800]   The author stuff was like, well, do the author stuff,
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.760]   but you can only route it through a Google profile.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.560]   You can't use another, you know, an H card or a V card
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.000]   or something on your own site.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.280]   We're only verified if you connect it to our site.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.720]   And there's a certain sense of,
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.600]   we want to put ourselves in the middle again,
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.400]   which is not the, you know, not the open web culture
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.160]   that Google built itself on.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.280]   So there's, I'm, you know, I think that--
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.120]   - We don't know a lot of the--
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120]   - The hearts in the place.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.040]   - Where it came from.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.240]   - We have to wait and see.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.920]   - We don't know a live search, which, who's gotched the deal?
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.760]   - Yes.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.280]   - Could it come from Twitter?
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.400]   - It could, yeah.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.440]   It could be one of these things where, you know,
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.280]   like when Google and Facebook are trying to get something done
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.840]   and they don't trust, neither trust each other enough
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.360]   just to sit down and have a sense of negotiation about it.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.400]   - All right, we got a run.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.240]   I wish we didn't have to.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.080]   This is so much fun.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.480]   And what, there's so many things,
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.560]   other things we could talk about.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.280]   Our congratulations to the winners
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.520]   of the first Google science fair
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   and 15 finalists yesterday at Google's headquarters.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.080]   They streamed it, by the way,
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.200]   which is very cool on YouTube Live.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.760]   And the winners are, in fact, by the way,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.320]   all girls, Lauren Hodge in the 13 to 14 age group.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.040]   She studied the effect of different marinades
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.440]   on the level of carcinogens and grilled chicken.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.280]   (laughing)
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.840]   Sorry, that's just a great subject.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.800]   Naomi Shah in the 15 to 16 age group,
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.880]   she endeavored to prove that making changes
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.680]   in indoor environments that improve air quality
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.680]   can reduce people's reliance on asthma medications.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.600]   Interesting, these are a little, they're very social.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.440]   It's good.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.280]   - Yeah.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.320]   - And Shri Bose in the 17 to 18 year old group,
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.760]   she discovered a way to improve ovarian cancer treatment
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.840]   for patients when they built up a resistance
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.800]   to chemotherapy drugs.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   - Jesus.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.000]   - Smart, smart women.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.280]   And I think this is great that the first three winners
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.040]   of the Google science fair should be women
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.640]   and so much for all the people who say
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.360]   where are all the women in science and engineering.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.480]   - Well, during the time I was there,
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.320]   during the science fair,
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.960]   I'll tell you where they went during it.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.240]   All the families were in the Google swag shop like crazy.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.240]   (laughing)
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.040]   - I also like it that the trophies of the three girls won
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.320]   are Lego, made out of Lego.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.440]   - That is so cool.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.760]   That's so cool.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.600]   (laughing)
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.560]   - All right, that wraps it up.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.360]   Let's get our, we're gonna get our,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.480]   I don't know if Gina, Gina normally does a tip of the week.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.840]   Do you wanna do a tip, Kevin Marks?
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.040]   Or I don't know if we ask you to do that.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.440]   - I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.280]   - Here's a tip.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.120]   - You can be a grammar.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:58.960]   - Class ticks.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.440]   (laughing)
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.600]   Literature tip.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.000]   Hey, actually let me ask you that.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.280]   Okay, the graduate, you rewrite it for 2011.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.480]   And Ben Braddock, you know, he just got out of college,
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.240]   doesn't know what to do with his life.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.960]   The guy, a friend of the family comes and pulls him over
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.160]   and says, "Ben, Ben, I wanna tell you one thing, one word."
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.480]   Now in 1960, what was it?
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.720]   '67, it was plastic.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.520]   And actually, that was probably right.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.360]   What would you say the word would be
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.920]   if you were talking to a recent college graduate?
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.200]   The one word,
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.200]   Kevin Marks says, "One word, kid."
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   Social, mobile.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.760]   - I'll grow.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.000]   - Green energy.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.680]   - Green, green's good.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.520]   - Green's good.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.720]   Green energy.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.040]   Waffles.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.640]   - Batteries.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.520]   - Or chatroom.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.000]   - Bacon, I think they're hungry.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.840]   It must be lunchtime.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.680]   (laughing)
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.520]   - It is.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.280]   - Notice chatroom, none of us can read out.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.120]   - Burrito.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.480]   Chipotle.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.240]   - They're throwing all their words back out of us.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.200]   Chatroom says, "You're gonna have a boss."
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.400]   - "Homer-ma's."
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.840]   I got one word for you, kid.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.680]   - Homer-ma's.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.400]   - Our number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.040]   - Oh, well, let's kind of stretch.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.520]   Let's see, the LA Times says that
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.680]   they looked at searches on Google
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.240]   as an indication of the economy
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.520]   and found that interest in investing in stocks
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.600]   is going, continues to go down
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.560]   while the word saving gets a lot more requests.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.480]   And that's a fairly obvious thing,
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.920]   and it's just a zeitgeisty thing,
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.120]   but it occurs to me lately that,
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.720]   you know, the guys who made a hedge fund out of Twitter,
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.320]   this kind of data really shows what we think
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.120]   as a people and indicates where we're going as a country.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.720]   The more public that can be,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.360]   the better that can be for all of us,
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.400]   the more that becomes open knowledge that we know.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.280]   So I would just say to the likes of Google
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.520]   and Facebook and Twitter,
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.240]   this kind of data that you have in an aggregate form
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.120]   is ours, we made it.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.960]   - Yeah.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.800]   - Give it to us.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.640]   - It's ours.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.500]   Google did.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.520]   I have a tool and it's something I should have done
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.440]   a long time ago and it's something that many of you
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.840]   will be, oh, of course, obvious duh.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.320]   For the longest time, you know, I have a T-Mobile G2X
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.920]   and I've been waiting, I'm on froyo.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.360]   I've been waiting, just give me gingerbread.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.560]   I just want some gingerbread.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.440]   And supposedly it's in the offing
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.040]   and it has been for months.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.000]   If you're stuck with a phone,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.040]   an Android phone that is not being updated,
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.440]   may I highly recommend the Cyanogen mod,
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.120]   it was easy as Pi to root this phone.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.600]   It's a one-click root.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.280]   You do have to connect it via USB
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.280]   and there's a lot of button pushing and stuff.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.920]   But once I put Cyanogen mod on here,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.600]   the CM7, release candidate one for this phone is now out,
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.160]   it suddenly stopped rebooting.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.720]   It stopped crashing.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.440]   It got fast, it got reliable.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.680]   It made a huge difference.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   He is doing amazing stuff.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.160]   In fact, let's get Cyanogen on if we can,
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.560]   'cause I'd love to get him on the show.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.120]   He's taking the open source Android code,
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.920]   cleaning it up, polishing it with a large team,
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.240]   I'm sure, of volunteers and making really excellent ROMs.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.480]   To make this completely legal,
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.560]   which it is, in fact HTC just announced,
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.200]   they're gonna stop blocking root exploits
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.200]   that they're gonna support this.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.960]   And Google says it's okay as long as you don't include
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.200]   the proprietary Google Apps,
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.920]   which he doesn't, there are separate downloads
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.120]   that you put on here.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.280]   Of course, you get them all, but they're separate downloads.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.680]   He's just done a wonderful job
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.560]   of making a more stable operating system
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.280]   than the stock operating system
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.880]   for many of these handset companies.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.960]   Best way to find out if your phone is,
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.120]   or how to root your phone
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.840]   if there's a CM7 for your phone
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.680]   is to go to xda-developers.com
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.880]   and search in the device database,
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.960]   or just go to the forums
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.680]   and search for the phone model that you have.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.520]   There are so many nice guys in there
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.720]   who will help you, and gals,
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.280]   who will help you unlock, upgrade,
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.320]   and modify your phone.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.520]   Highly recommended,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   if you've been afraid of doing this, don't be.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.480]   I was kind of stunned at how easy it was.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.000]   And more importantly,
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.600]   'cause I had a bad experience as jailbreaking the iPhone.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.840]   What a great result I got.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.160]   This thing is much more reliable.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.240]   - Hey Leo. - Yes, sir.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.200]   - Go to plus right now.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.400]   - Oh dear.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.480]   I think we had our first,
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.320]   I can't get to it,
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.400]   I think we have our first plus crash.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.640]   - Is plus down?
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   - Mine is. - Well, I have plus
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   as the home button on my server,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.400]   no, it's just you. - Oh, okay.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.240]   Good for me.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.120]   - And of course, I've got animated panda gifts
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.000]   right there on the front page.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:27.840]   (laughing)
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.160]   I spoke too soon.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.680]   But you know, that's cute.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.360]   I don't mind starting my day with that to you.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.120]   - That's the time you're gonna get sick of those.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.040]   - Oh no, who gets sick of pandas falling in the snow?
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.560]   Nobody, they're cute, they're cuddly.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.680]   And that's it for this week in Google.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:46.280]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis for joining us,
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.480]   even though you suffer from jet lag.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.760]   Jeff of course is the blogger at buzzmachine.com,
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.560]   the professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.520]   He's @JeffJARVIS on Twitter plus Jeff Jarvis on Google plus,
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.560]   and his new book is imminent.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.080]   September 26th, public parts, Simon and Schuster look for it.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.960]   His current book, What Would Google Do is still a great read.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.880]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.720]   We appreciate it.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.560]   And filling in for Gina Trapani, who is in China,
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.280]   watching pandas go down slides into the snow, I might add.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.400]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for being here.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.360]   Kevin is now at salesforce.com.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.200]   Chatter.com is the place to go to find out more
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.080]   about what he's working on there.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.360]   - Also, we wanted to mention Tamagotian.tv.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.080]   - Oh, I forgot, yes, you have a wonderful podcast.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.880]   And we've got Paul Adams coming up on that in a couple of weeks.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.400]   I think it's maybe three weeks.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.720]   - Oh!
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.680]   - We've also got a bunch of other interesting people
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.560]   talking about this social stuff there.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.520]   So if you're interested in the class
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.920]   and the social side of things,
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.600]   that's very much on topic.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.840]   - Yes, let me plug this.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.560]   Heather and Deborah and you are just great.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.600]   It's a wonderful show, which we had on the Twitter network
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.200]   for a while, and I'm glad that you've kept it going.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.880]   It's really fantastic.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.000]   - We're also thinking about maybe we could use Hangouts
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.160]   as the way of doing the video again,
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.880]   because the challenge is we can't afford as much gear as you can,
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.160]   but there may be a way to blouse that.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.840]   - You might be able to completely do a end around.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.440]   - Yeah, that'd be very cool.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.480]   - Thank you, Kevin, for being here.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.320]   I appreciate it.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.160]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.000]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.200]   We record Twig every Wednesday afternoon,
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.840]   1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.640]   That's 2000 UTC, if you want to join us.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.840]   If you can't watch live, don't worry.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.560]   You can download audio and video of the shows
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.920]   very easily from twit.tv/twig
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.000]   or your favorite podcast aggregator.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.600]   I use Google Listen.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.480]   You could use iTunes.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.720]   It's everywhere you want to be,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.080]   including on the Roku box in many other places.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:43.920]   Thanks for being here.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.600]   Don't forget, we are going to the new studio.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.120]   We are not far off, just less than two weeks away
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:49.960]   from our new studio.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.200]   Two weeks hence, this show will be from the new studio
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.400]   with a brand new look.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.240]   The costs are tremendous.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.000]   - Buy your bricks.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.080]   - Buy more.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.120]   - Even if you've already bought a brick.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.080]   Buy another bricks.twit.tv.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.240]   No, it's not tax deductible.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.160]   No, I'm not a charity.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.440]   Yes, I do need your money.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440]   It helps us build a better show.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.840]   And we actually, I don't need a big.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.080]   I really appreciate anybody who's contributed.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.360]   No need to these shows are free and remain free,
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.680]   but it is very helpful.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.000]   And I have to say, we've sold over a thousand bricks.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.120]   The wall of honor is starting to look really,
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.480]   really cool in the new studio.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.240]   And I hope you come visit it.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.040]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.720]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:38.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:46.300]   [MUSIC]
