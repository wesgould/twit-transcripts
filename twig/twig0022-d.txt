Transcript:  This is TWIG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is TWIG.  This is TWIG.  This is TWIG.  This week in Google to show the covers, Google and the cloud.  And on the line with us, our regular panel of experts, starting with the lovely Gina  Tripani from the Research Triangle today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's doing research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Research in the mass potatoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yum.  And turkey.  Yum.  Yum.  Good research.  That's the kind of research I can dig.  I can get behind.  It's great to see you, Gina.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  Jeff is in his home in New York City, I can tell.  The book lines study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just out of focus today.  I'm feeling a little out of focus today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of all, yeah, well, no, you look pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's on the blue camera today, which actually, ironically, is kind of a little yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  But that's just the way it is.  We were remarking before the show began that, you know, this is a holiday week and I suppose  week will be the same.  And there really isn't that much to say, although it is the end of a decade and the end of a  year.  So, I mean, one of the things we could talk about a little bit is what a year it's been.  And a lot of the Google blogs did that, talking about what happened this year, are there favorite  new features on various Google products and so forth.  But we could even talk about the decade because this is completing the odds.  Google was started in 1998.  It's 11 years old.  It's 11 years old.  So most of its growth happened in this particular decade.  So we could talk a little bit about that as well.  And look a little forward to Google in 2010.  And then before I get email from people saying, you know, it's not really the end of the decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The decade ends in 2011 with the conclusion of the 10th year of the decade because we  start counting at one, not zero.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You love your religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care because if on the last day of 2010 we do a decade ender, I'll get far more  email from people saying, what are you talking about?  You're already in the teens.  This is not the end of the decade.  So I'd prefer to get fewer mail from correct people than lots of mail from incorrect people,  if that makes any sense at all.  So what are the big stories of the week?  There's not, you know, Google, I imagine Google takes the week off like any sensible corporation  would this week of Christmas.  And then next week is probably going to be equally slow.  Did anything happen at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Besides the usual Santa silliness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Yeah.  Google was, did Google do a Santa thing?  I didn't even notice.  I was offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the big thing for me was the open email came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what does Google mean by open was decreed to the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what does Google mean by open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking for the darn link now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it was interesting while you're looking, I will mention one thing I  did notice because I was tracking Santa is that Google owned the Santa tracker.  Forget NORAD.  It was from NORAD.  It was NORAD talking.  But boy, if you look at the mashup, it had a big Google in the lower right hand corner.  This is something I started.  I've been doing this for years as all radio DJs did because even 20 years ago, before  the internet, we would call NORAD and they had a phone line and we'd play it over the  air so the kids would go to bed early because on Christmas Eve is Santa getting tracked  across the globe.  And NORAD has been doing that I think for many years, 50 years maybe.  Then of course, once the internet came along, you were able to in increasingly less rudimentary  ways track Santa.  This year was a Google map mashup with embedded video and photos and a big Google on it.  Google bought Santa.  I think that's the big acquisition of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely.  Well, it makes sense.  It takes over the North Pole.  Everything is free.  Oh, guess who went to NORAD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just couldn't resist, could you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll show you.  Are they still tracking Santa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's kind of done, isn't he?  His journey is done.  The official map is done.  It was noradsanta.org.  As long as you can play the music, let's play.  Really bad MIDI music and Santa has completed his flight, come back in 2010 and see him  again.  But I'll just show you.  So that's a Google map.  the video things.  You'll see the Santa cam video via YouTube.  And if you go full screen, they did, I think this is Google SketchUp, but look, you see  the big Google logo on the video and they'll show Santa and it's Santa has just been sighted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  off the coast of Florida.  He has finally arrived in the United States and into US Northern commands area of responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I swear that's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We sound a little more excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, they use the NORAD.  Everybody gets a chance and they're not pros.  But look, see, I think these are Google SketchUp buildings that he's flying through.  That's definitely Google Earth.  That's cool.  Yeah.  But look at the size of that Google logo.  I mean, there's no question Google owns this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Pretty cool.  So Google bought Santa.  That's a big acquisition.  Eric did say they would be buying more things.  Do you think they paid for that as an ad or they just said, no, you can use it, but you  just got to give us a big plug.  They probably have the latter, right?  So this was the week Google explained what they mean by open.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jonathan Rosenberg, the Senior Vice President of Product Management put out a memo that  tried to explain to the troops what was meant by open, both in terms of projects and open  source and opening up your code whenever possible, though one wonders about the exceptions  to that rule and then about open information and our data being open to us.  Gina, what did you think of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was really interesting.  It was interesting.  You know, John Gruber said that he felt that the whole thing was just this big pile of  horse manure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Gruber has become the internet curmudgeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He hates everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was interesting.  I mean, you know, they had a little kind of jab at Apple, you know, implying that the  iPhone and the Apple systems are closed systems.  Well, they are.  It's open systems.  And I think that's what kind of tweet Gruber, although Gruber made the point that there  are a lot of things that Google is not transparent about, like its search algorithm and the way  that it scales its servers.  But, you know, Rosenberg actually did address that in the blog post.  So it's a really long blog post on the official Google blog.  It was an email, I guess, that had gone out to companywide.  And he said, you know, there are some cases in which being open and transparent isn't  beneficial to everyone.  So his whole point is saying that openness and transparency and open standards and free  data, data that can be transported, you know, from one place to another is good for the  internet.  And anything that's good for the internet is good for Google.  And anything that's good for the internet and Google is good for everyone, basically.  But he said, you know, there are times...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, that's a great expression of it.  That really is the spirit of it.  Yeah, I mean, he said...  It's good for GM, it's good for America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Right.  But he said there are some times when being open isn't beneficial to all, like the search  algorithm.  He basically said that if Google was open and transparent about what their search algorithm  is, it would enable people to game it.  So that was kind of interesting.  That was Gruber's complaint, like, oh, well, you know, Google isn't open about the things  that make it money.  But Rosenberg was saying, you know, that closed systems, that the old way of thinking is that  closed proprietary systems are profitable.  And so you have this kind of old school MBA view of protecting your IP.  But Google's taking the other approach, which is just to be as open as possible and to help  along the internet and help along everyone who uses the internet and that that's only  good for Google.  So, I mean, I have to say that, you know, he pointed to the data liberation...  It does.  It does.  He pointed to the data liberation front and a couple of other, you know, initiatives within  Google.  He pointed to Android and Wave and Chrome, all open source projects, as examples of this  in action.  And I have to say that I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the kind of the heart of the logic, he says.  So if you're trying to grow an entire industry as broadly as possible, open systems trump  closed.  And that is exactly what we're trying to do with the internet.  Our commitment to open systems is not altruistic.  It's good business.  Since an open internet creates a steady stream of innovations that attracts users and usage  and grows the entire industry.  He quotes Hal Varian in his book, Information Rules.  Here's the equation.  Reward equals total value added to the industry times our share of industry value.  So he says all other things being equal, a 10% increase in share or a 10% increase in  industry value should lead to the same outcome.  But in our industry, a 10% increase in industry value yields a much bigger reward because  it stimulates economy of scale across an entire industry.  That makes a lot of sense.  So leverage, he's saying we get much more leverage by improving the internet than we  would by increasing our share of the market.  It's a much more valuable thing for us to do.  That makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does.  It goes to what you said last week, Leo, about the revolution we're seeing.  It's not just a powerful smart company involved here.  It's new rules.  It's just a new way of doing business that wasn't possible before because we didn't have  the network structure to enable this.  But when you have this network ecology, it changes business utterly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I blew it.  I should have gotten Gruber on so he could declare horse Pucky in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think my favorite paragraph is this.  He says, closed systems are well defined and profitable, but only for those who control  them.  Open systems are chaotic and profitable, but only for those who understand them well and  move faster than everyone else.  Closed systems grow quickly while open systems evolve more slowly.  So placing your bets on open requires the optimism, will and means to think long term.  At Google, we have all three of these.  So they're basically explaining the reason why Google starts these projects that don't  have immediately obvious business models that you can't look at and say, obviously, this  is how they're making money, that they're going into long term projects like Wave, like  Chromium OS, like Chrome OS, like Chrome and Android.  And I was right there with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember discussions years ago after Six Apart first in the early days of Movable Type  decided to make that a platform and then have a hosting service on top of it and finally  started licensing the platform.  And there was a hue and cry because they limited the license so much because they didn't want  to disadvantage their own hosting service.  I remember the time thinking that the mistake was they were in kind of a conflict of interest  there.  They should split the two up.  Then along came Movable Type, I'm sorry, WordPress, and WordPress had the dot org.  When WordPress got VC investment from Polaris, I talked at the time to the folks from the  venture capital company and urged them to do what Matt wanted them to do, which was  to leave the dot org as the platform and make the dot com merely the first company built  atop it.  And going to what Rosemary just said, it means that WordPress dot com is faster and smarter  than others, but that everyone who benefits the platform benefits WordPress dot com and  everyone.  And that's just such a different way to do business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yet I wonder, is it a good thing?  I'm looking at another article, this is from the Filo Security blog that says over 60%  of US state governments have gone Google.  Is that such a good idea that one company control the data for 60% of the state governments?  That's a little scary.  We get this all the time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is big and so everybody says, oh, is that a good thing?  Well, yeah, there's danger there.  GM was big and it brought down the auto industry.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  But what are you going to do about that?  Split up GM?  Would that have helped if Chevrolet were a different company?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would hope that state governments are backing this stuff up locally.  The argument is Google now controls government's access to its own data.  I hope that's not the case because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the what if?  I mean, Google gets bombed, I guess that's a bad thing.  And suddenly what?  Cuts off all state governments from their license plate applications?  It's an easy rhetorical thing to say and start a conversation.  Uh-oh, that could be a bad thing.  Yes, anything in life could be a bad thing.  We don't rule ourselves around that.  I see.  But then I'm an optimist.  Cock-eyed to a fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's an important point, but you're right.  What is the worst case scenario?  And I can't really think of it.  Some foreign government becomes 51% control of Google somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's what it is.  If something goes wrong, I hate to go so far off topic, but Twitter is exploding with this  just now because the TSA came out with new rules.  Let's talk about that.  It's a berserk.  You're not going to be allowed to pee in the last hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pee?  have your laptop, although you're right.  Not being able to pee could be... you have to bring a bottle, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe for the boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I renewed a proposal I blogged in December 2001 that we all have to fly naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's an easier way to do this, which they do in LL.  No carry-ons.  Just eliminate carry-ons and you can pee all you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the problem becomes...  Try to stretch this back to Google.  If you make rules around everything that could go wrong or has gone wrong once...  Yeah, you're the bubble boy.  Yeah.  We'll soon have the pretzel ban.  Somebody tried to use pretzel salt to make a bomb.  No pretzels.  What can you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you're right.  You cannot protect against everything.  And clearly our security on airplanes is all about security theater, not about true security.  Why the last hour?  Why not the last hour and a half?  Why not the last two hours?  Why the last hour?  That's just kind of arbitrary, isn't it?  If I decided to blow up the plane at hour 101, have I done any less damage?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, it's just theater.  It's security theater.  We've known this.  Bruce Schneier is very famously...  There's a great article in The Atlantic last November, a year ago, which the author conspires  with Bruce Schneier, the security expert, to demonstrate that there is no security at  all.  He brought in knives.  He brought in scissors.  He used fake boarding passes.  I mean, it was a mockery.  It's theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So, go back to the fears about Google and states.  So should the 23rd state not be allowed to use Google?  22 is okay?  20 is all right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I frankly trust Google more than I do state government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or the TSA right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let Google do airport security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I tweeted this.  I'm all in favor of government blogging.  I think it's a wonderful thing.  It just doesn't make me feel comfy that I go to the TSA blog and what's the topic but  a poem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they drop the ball on the whole blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one they need to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was the night before travel and all through the suitcase.  What suitcase?  I'm not allowed to have one!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For those who haven't read it, I'm sure that there will be a fewer.  And I think Zini Jardin was the first to really...  She tweeted as she was being exposed to this for the first time on an Air Canada flight  that she even said the flight attendant seemed very embarrassed.  They said, we've just learned about this.  You will not be allowed to get up out of your seat in the last hour.  You will not be allowed to use any electronics in the last hour.  So put everything away.  You will not be allowed to go to the bathroom in the last hour.  All due to this nutcase who set off explosives on the Delta flight yesterday.  You know, it's like the shoe thing.  It's like, well, you're going to wait and see what they do and then ban anything that...  I mean, okay, then what next?  It's just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait to fly home next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious about this.  Obviously, they'll do the minimum they could do without the public revolting or not flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may have a line on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is...  They're going to have entire plane loads.  Everyone coming in for a landing is angry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the word to the geeks is bring a paperback.  What's that?  You know, you're not...  I presume they include the Kindle in the electronics.  You're not going to be able to read at all unless you have something.  You're going to be reading that Air In-Flight magazine for an hour.  There's about 10 minutes worth of reading there.  Maybe it's all a plan to get you to buy things from that catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sky Mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sky Mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Sky Mall conspiracy, clearly.  Clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the airline bailout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Buy more from Sky Mall.  You know, if you look at that Sky Mall catalog for an hour, you're going to buy some golf  club that has a radio in it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone's got to start putting advertising on the puke bags because they'll have a captive  audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the Google phone.  And there's still these rumors that they're going to sell it, although it's invite only,  according to Engadget and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's up with that, Leo?  You got to hook us up.  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I can get an invite?  I can get a wave invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you got the first wave invite, I think.  Yeah.  I'm going to...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Hopefully I didn't call in all my favors for wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How would you get it?  Look, if the three of us can't get an invite, how are you going to do it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  Is it going to be registered developers?  Is it going to be, you know, I don't know.  How are they going to choose?  It's not like there's even...  Now, has Google made an official announcement about this or is this just all rumor and secondary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like all the announcements are coming from Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And now we're talking about a January 5th release date.  It's the 26th.  Don't you think that they would have said something or is this just going to be a surprise?  Yay.  Some lucky people have been invited on the 5th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the Google way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to the frequencies that the phone is capable of, it's not an AT&T phone.  It is a T-Mobile phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  T-Mobile only.  So even though supposedly it's not locked, in essence T-Mobile doesn't lock you because  you can go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't need to because they're the only ones who have an HSDPA on that frequency.  900 megahertz, 1700 megahertz and 2100 megahertz.  Now listen to this.  It's 7.2 megabits down, 2 megabits up if you can get that 3G from T-Mobile.  But that's in very limited markets.  5 megapixel camera with mechanical autofocus and LED flash.  It sounds a lot like the Droid.  It's got Android 2.1 of course.  5 megabytes RAM, 512 megabytes ROM, 512 megabytes RAM, 512 megabytes ROM, 4 gigabyte micro SD  in the box.  Of course you could put a 32 gig in there.  AMOLED display, those beautiful displays, WVGA resolution.  It's similar to the Droid in a lot of ways.  But no slide out keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh I'm in.  Okay.  I've used up all my self-discipline on the Droid.  I'm not even going to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You never did get a Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never got the Droid.  Oh yeah.  Well see now I'm going to be mad because I got the Droid and now I'm going to be mad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because I, well let's see if we get an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay Gina.  All right now here's your psychological test for the day.  So January 5 comes the announcement that let's say February 1 you can get the Nexus 1 and  then January 1 as of 26 comes the announcement of the tablet.  What are you going for here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the tablet Apple's tablet or is the tablet?  Okay so it's not an Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The latest rumors there and of course you know it could be speaking of theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could be the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but the report is that they reserve some space at the end of January for a day.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now everybody's talking about the fact that they have the trademark for Isolate.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't buy that.  So there's the temptation.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah you know the tablet hasn't, I don't know.  I'm kind of still kind of feeling bad about it.  I think I'll go for the phone.  I'll tell you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like deal or no deal.  And Jeff you're the Howie Mandel of Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't touch me.  I say oh I'll take the phone Gene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should go put up a briefcase right now.  Yeah really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I don't know.  You know I'm with you Gene.  I'm real skeptical of tablet but I just I also don't underestimate the ability of Apple  to come up with some very interesting for instance marketing things you know stores  and stuff that might make it more compelling.  Agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agreed.  I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it just from a design perspective.  I mean I'm really interested to see what it looks like but I'm not like dying for a tablet  personally but maybe they'll change their mind about that.  I'm not dying for a Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think the Nexus One sounds so much better than anything else that's out there.  I mean it's an HTC phone.  It's probably very much like the G2.  I think the Droid is a great phone.  I'm very happy with the Droid.  I wish it had a better camera.  It does not have a very good camera despite the five megapixels.  But invite only.  How do you even do invite only at retail?  I don't even understand how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the psychology of it is obviously working on me.  Yeah.  The invitation part makes it even more exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you played with 2.1?  You apparently if you have a there is a cracked 2.1 that you could put on an unlocked Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh is there?  I have to do that this week.  I haven't played with it.  I saw this very shaky screencast that just made me feel a little nauseous because I couldn't  hold the camera straight.  It was very Blair Witch.  But it looks really good.  It looks like an incremental kind of upgrade.  Nothing that was shockingly different.  But it looked real smooth and interesting.  So yeah I definitely want to play with 2.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hearing that the UI for the Nexus One feels different but it's still just Android  right?  Is there anything they could have done specially for this or is there a build top Android just  for the Nexus One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's slightly different.  It seems to have the major difference that I saw.  It's got a little home button that you push and it kind of flings out the menu in kind  of a flashier smoother transitional kind of way.  I think it has maybe a few more different widgets that I hadn't seen before.  But I think it's basically Android.  I recognize it as Android even in a fuzzy screencast.  I don't know Leo have you heard of anything too different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I just wish and I don't think it does it.  I wish they had more home screens.  Three is just not enough.  And I just don't get why they're so limited.  I know that on the Eris there's more because it's not a Google experience phone.  So Motorola configured it with more.  I don't know what will happen when they give and I'm told this is imminent.  Push 2.0 upgrades out to the Eris.  I've tried all the home page replacements and all of them just kind of sucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They slow it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited that Mint the financial app is announced that they'll have an Android app  out in the first quarter.  Oh that's good news.  That was one of the ones that was bugging me.  It was like the one app that I'd point out and say the Android market is not complete  because this is a great iPhone app and it needs to be out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now that Seesmic is out for Twitter on the Droid, I think Seesmic is quite good and  it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  And Evernote.  Evernote I got on here.  Evernote's app.  Yeah.  That just got approved and now is official and out in the Android market.  So the bigger holes are really filling in and I like to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Foursquare is on.  Yeah.  I mean and you get stuff that's exclusive like Google Goggles that you can't get on  the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Google Voice is now coming to the iPhone.  We'll get to that in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not officially but there's a semi-official.  What else is on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if it'll use a...  Have you guys heard about Pastry Kit on the iPhone?  Just see Gruber's piece on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pastry Kit.  Good name.  What does it do?  This is all the code names are pastries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually it's an iPhone thing.  It's a JavaScript framework for the iPhone that makes web apps act very much like native  iPhone apps.  That's interesting.  Which is kind of interesting because it's really going to give the iPhone a little bit  of a leg up on Android in terms of web apps.  So that'll be interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Lifehacker did have a Google Nexus hands-on.  I don't know if you know the guy or gal who wrote this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Chen.  Actually it was Gizmodo.  Oh it's from Gizmodo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He liked it.  He says thanks to a clandestine meeting with a source.  Basically it's Google's droid killer.  He says it's faster, it's better in every way.  That's pretty impressive.  He says slightly thinner than the iPhone, slightly lighter than the iPhone.  I like that.  It is a gorgeous screen.  OLED screen is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is the Nexus one the first piece of hardware that Google has had a hand in designing besides  their search appliance server thing?  That yellow box they sold to businesses?  Yeah they do in-house stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah that's the first consumer thing I can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I think that's what I'm kind of, you know like when the announcement goes out about  I mean they're not just going to send phones to people randomly.  I mean these are going to be invitations to purchase the phone I assume.  Well I don't know.  Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would they bother with purchase?  Yeah I mean give me an invitation, give me the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you guys think they're just going to send phones to lucky folks?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get the golden ticket.  I know.  If you ask for the right search you'll suddenly get a BING!  The magic duck drops from the Google's page and you get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically Jason says if Google releases this phone they will immediately preempt every  other Android based phone out there.  It will be the phone.  He says it beats the hell out of the Droid in every single task we threw at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing I'm going to do here is to upset the rules of telephones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah you can't do that.  You won't get another deal if you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they won't need another deal.  That's the point.  That's exactly the point.  They want to break those chains Mr. Marley.  Sorry Christmas of the Mind.  A little Christmas reference.  That's good.  I think we should change the way the industry works.  Who else could do that but Google and our customers going to complain?  Not us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft has a very infelicitous phrase called killing your babies that they use internally  only because it's so horrible.  But essentially it's what Google would be doing which is that in order to go to the  next thing you have to kind of destroy the previous thing.  And you have to be willing to do that.  This is what Microsoft says.  We're willing to undermine our relationships with Samsung and iRiver to go forward in the  Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That kind of thing.  I think you're right Leo.  Look at how television has done better than newspapers because networks were willing to  just tell their affiliates to buzz off.  And we're going to stream online because that's where the future goes.  Sorry, tough noogies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the tough noogies economy.  That's a much better phrase.  And Gadget does have a review from April of a Samsung with an OLED screen powered by Android.  But that hasn't been released.  The Samsung 7500, have we seen that yet?  That would be a team level as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I think what this amounts to is we're hardware people.  I think that the revolutionary thing here is not going to be the phone itself.  It's going to be the model.  The business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to talk about pastries and I guess it's pastry that's allowing the Google  Voice app to come back to the iPhone.  This Voice Central app.  And just a bit before we go on much I want to mention CES is coming up and we're going  to be going to CES in style thanks to Ford and we're going to have a great Lincoln.  I think it's the MKS with Ford Sync equipped.  So if you're coming to the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas in two weeks come say hi.  I will give you a personal demo of Ford Sync.  Sync is the amazing hands-free Bluetooth music search media playing information system  in the new Ford Lincoln and Mercury vehicles that allows you to do things like ask for  weather reports.  You never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road though.  That's what's beautiful.  You don't look down at a screen.  It tells you this is the five day forecast.  This is what the ski report is.  This is what traffic conditions are.  And turn-by-turn GPS built in to all Ford Sync.  Of course every Ford Sync has an audio connection and a USB port.  So if you've got a Droid for instance you hook up the Droid to the USB port.  It sees the Droid.  It puts the songs on its index and now you can call for songs by name.  If you've got A2DP built in as you do on the Droid or the iPhone, the 3GS you can get in  the car and it starts playing immediately.  You can control it from the phone.  I listen to my audio books.  They stop when I get out of the car.  They start up again when I get in.  It is simply put the best and going open they're going to have an SDK.  There's some big announcements coming from CES from Ford.  I'm told.  I'm not on the, I don't do embargoes so I'm not on the list that can see what these are  but people are saying, wait till you see, wait till you see, wait till you see.  Sync is amazing.  It's the new platform in Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  It's kind of like Hal 9000 in your car without that whole lock you out of the pod bay door  and all that thing.  Go to syncmyridepodcast.com to find out more or just visit your local Ford, Lincoln and  Mercury dealer and say, I want to test drive sync, Ford sync and we'll see in Vegas.  We're going to be talking to the CEO of Ford and the chief guy behind the designer behind  Ford sync and we're going to get the scoop from them on what's new in sync.  So Voice Central was an application that was yanked from the app store when Apple pulled  the Google third party applications and Google voices, Google's own Google voice application.  So the company behind Voice Central is coming back with Voice Central.  They call it the black swan edition.  It's browser based.  I don't know if they're using pastry.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pastry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pastry kit.  Pastry kit or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't say, I can't find confirmation that it's using page pastry kit, but it is going  to be using HTML5 local caching.  It's going to be a pretty advanced mobile web app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty exciting.  I think HTML5 is going to make this kind of all mood because you'll be able to do everything  in the web and so forth.  Is Safari on the iPhone a good HTML5 client though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's perfect.  I don't think it's quite all the way there.  I know Google wave will say that mobile Safari isn't totally compliant.  I think it checks for HTML5.  But at the same time, I have seen, actually John Gruber did a pastry kit kind of demo.  There's an iPhone user guide that uses pastry kit which stores the data locally.  So if you look at the user guide once and then you disconnect your iPhone or iPod touch,  you can go into your settings and you'll see the local store of the database of this user  guide and browse it offline, which tells me that mobile Safari is definitely doing at  least offline caching of HTML5.  That's pretty hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Very interesting.  Which is what's the best HTML5 client?  Must be Chrome right now, right?  Or can you not say best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, well Chrome is WebKit, right?  So WebKit is Safari.  That's true.  And Safari and Chrome, Firefox isn't WebKit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope.  It's got Gekko.  I think Firefox is right at the front of the front of the line as well.  So I'm not sure if there's one that's best.  I'm not sure if there's one browser that fully implements HTML5 yet to tell you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does make sense now the Chrome, the Google Chrome thing, because it forwards HTML5.  It kind of forces everybody to support HTML5.  You can't let Chrome leapfrog you.  So again, this is kind of that open strategy.  Well, we don't want to own the browser marketplace.  We don't care.  What we want to do is forward standards.  And HTML5 is a standard that is critical to Google to going forward.  It's a great HTML5 demo of YouTube that doesn't have any flash in it at all.  And that's got to be the future for YouTube is no flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting how the tech community has started to kind of turn against flash.  Maybe not started to, maybe always has, but with the vulnerabilities again and again in  flash.  I mean, this thing is a security nightmare.  The amount of CPU cycles it uses, I mean, it basically pegs your CPU.  And yet it's ubiquitous.  I mean, even Google uses it.  But there's this kind of growing, I notice this growing demand, this tension for getting  away from flash.  What can we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And from the content side, from my non-geek side, it's always the show off tool.  I'm going to control this in every way I can.  It's like the early days of not doing text, but doing GIFs.  It's the same for flash.  And it's overused in content like crazy.  And even though Google can search it now, it hurts your Google juice.  It just takes time.  It's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm told by the chat room that the HTML5 demo for YouTube does not work in Firefox,  but it does work in Chrome, of course, and apparently in Safari.  I'm trying to load it right now.  If I can get it loaded, I will.  I'm trying to load it in Safari.  This is it.  This is, if you Google YouTube HTML5, this is a YouTube page that has no flash.  It's all rendered using HTML5 and O3D and looks just like YouTube.  It's got all the controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got all the controls.  It looks like the full screen doesn't work, but it's high def.  That's pretty impressive.  Nice.  Yeah.  So I think you're right.  I think WebKit is the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And HTML5 will replace Gears, right?  Yeah, Gears is dead.  It's dead, dead, dead.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is the status now?  So I still use Gears on Firefox, but they're not going to support it anymore, Gina?  What happened to Gears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're letting the sun sets on it, quote unquote, which means that some of the apps  still use it.  They just graduated offline Gmail from Labs, and that depends on Google Gears.  So it's still going to work with certain apps, but I think they're going to move apps off  of it, and they're going to kind of let it die eventually.  I think that's the plan and transition everything to HTML5.  But I think right now we're in this limbo, right, where browsers don't fully support  HTML5.  And Gears was kind of this thing that Google had developed.  So I think that Gears is going to slowly kind of ease its way out as HTML5 comes in.  But major things still depend on Gears, like Wave and like Gmail, offline Gmail anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, the interesting thing about this Voice Central thing using HTML5 is it's still going  to be a paid app.  So now Apple's really got a problem because now they've got developers putting apps on  the iPhone, charging for it, and Apple gets nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh, so this is going to be a pay for web app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to TechCrunch, Apple won't get any revenues.  It's just a mobile website.  I guess you subscribe, right?  It'll offer offline caching, takes advantage of the HTML5 features of mobile Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing is, developer G-Phone, and the way he explains it to me is that you can't  buy the apps because you don't necessarily have a phone account through which to buy  them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So you do it in the browser.  You do it just as you would any other paid service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is where Chromium goes.  So again, it goes back to what we said a few minutes ago.  It breaks the business model of not only of telco, mobile telco, but also now the new  business model of the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The App Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The App Store is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple's kind of hoist with its own petard though because they're the ones who didn't  want to put flash on the iPhone.  They wanted to kind of support HTML5.  In fact, they were the ones that when the iPhone was shipped said, we're not going  to offer regular apps.  We're only going to offer web apps.  So I don't know why, but you can't really look into Steve Jobs' mind and see if at  that time he was thinking, well, we're going to do an App Store, but it's just not ready  yet.  Or if he came to the belief we needed to do an App Store, because when the iPhone came  out there was no App Store, there were no apps.  It was all web apps.  And he said, I mean, you never know with Steve because he'll lie through his teeth, but he  said at the time, oh, who needs apps?  It's all going to be web based.  He was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you're seeing here too is the paid media model versus the ad supported media model  coming into conflict here.  And one of the stories on the friend feed is that Apple's market cap is about to approach  that of Google and Walmart.  But that's the Japanese monster movie we're seeing in Tokyo Bay now is, again, it's a  clash of business models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Apple's stock went up six point six dollars and ninety four cents pre-Christmas.  Market value one hundred and eighty eight billion, bringing its stock over two hundred  nine dollars.  Of course, Google is what over six hundred now?  Yes, it's just it's funny money.  But it is very I mean, that's very interesting.  But that's incredible.  So you're really seeing that we think Apple's this cute little thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it's a clash of two titans to to control or to dictate rather what the business  model of the web is going to be, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And where does and wither Microsoft, I guess withers the word.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There's the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the word.  They're not even in the game anymore.  What about Microsoft?  What do you think of Microsoft's cloud strategy?  You know, look, they've got I want to call them Ozzy Osborne.  They got Ray Ozzy, who is the guy who invented Lotus is their cloud wizard.  They've got they've got Azure, which is their cloud platform.  They've got Windows Live.  They've office 2010 is on the cloud is much like Google Apps.  But for some reason, they just don't seem as a cloud company, do they?  They don't really a cloud company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't really a cloud.  It's more like a cloud in a bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  You're saying it's not open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's us.  What's things where we want to in this amorphous thing?  Microsoft says, no, no, no, no, no.  Come to our cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We own the cloud.  You can't own the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Bing is doing better every month.  Bing is somewhat of a threat to Google.  In fact, I just put the Bing app on my iPhone and it's exactly like the Google app.  It has, you know, speech voice.  Not as good, but it has voice.  It has images, maps with turn by turn.  I mean, well, actually not exactly turn by turn, but you get directions.  You know, Microsoft at least is trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but but that's the thing that Microsoft doesn't have.  I mean, they're just too slow, right?  They're too slow and they also don't have user trust.  Like when I was reading that blog post about openness, it occurred to me that like  the essence of Google's business is user trust in the brand and scale and like their  ability to just roll things out fast, to respond very quickly to what people need and get it  out there.  Microsoft is playing catch up.  You know, they they they screwed up everyone's trust with Vista.  Right. And and and with with, you know, a lot of a lot of the windows.  I mean, not a lot of the windows products, but but Vista wasn't, you know, really didn't  go over well with with the mainstream consumer.  And they're just they're they're just super.  They're just slow.  There's a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room's given me a website Bing dash V.S.  dash Google dot com Bing versus Google dot com.  Can't choose default search engine.  Want to compare Bing and Google results?  Put your query in the box and press enter.  I'll put Gina Tripani.  Press search and we get two sides.  It's the on the left.  Gina's Bing on the right.  Gina's Google.  I have to say the Bing is prettier.  You've got pictures right at the top.  But it's you know, let's see this.  It looks like the same results.  Your website, Gina Tripani dot org is first.  Bing's got your Facebook next.  Google's got your Twitter next.  Bing's got your Twitter next.  Google's got smarter where.  Smarter where it's pretty far down on the Bing results.  In fact, it's it looks like it's not even on the first page on the Bing results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  James Fallows, the editor of the Atlantic.  I love him.  The former writer of the Atlantic was a piece on on the media this week,  the NPR show or the or I guess last week prior,  and tried to write a piece and research a piece using only Bing.  And in the about a third of the way through, he said he started cheating  and he said I'm going to find out what the difference was.  And in the end, he said it was OK, but he said Google was far better.  Yeah.  But I think the bigger thing is this.  I think that that Microsoft is fighting yesterday's battle.  They're there now, as Gina said, they're slow.  They're finally figuring out, oh, search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And meanwhile, Google is now moving past.  That's five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like Google's going to give up search or grant it to Microsoft,  but it's not where they're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not where the battleground is.  Yeah. No, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has the scale and they have the head start.  I think that this is what Google's all about.  I realize is the head start and the computing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess well said, Gina, speed and scale are it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's hard to hard to grab.  You can always do what they do.  Right. There's nothing so far.  There's nothing terribly secret.  You know, no secret sauce really about the end result, the edge uses  what's behind the scenes.  Maybe that's different.  Maybe the scale they have there.  But that's just because they're so big.  They have to do it well because they're just gigantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So David Pogue notes in his New York Times blog  a couple of days ago, Pogue's posts,  owners of BlackBerry's on the Verizon network woke up one day last week  to find they could no longer specify a preferred search service  in the search box on BlackBerry's browser.  It's Microsoft's Bing or nothing.  Microsoft paid Verizon half a billion dollars, according to the register to  again, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait a second, if you have a BlackBerry, you can only search with Bing.  That's what we're saying on the BlackBerry browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could put another browser on your BlackBerry.  Opera has a browser and so forth.  But on the default browser on your BlackBerry, Bing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  customer first, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Half a billion. Come on.  That's hard to turn down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, here's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a waste of a half a billion is what it is.  So Microsoft pardon me. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry about the money that they're spending to try to win search.  Win yesterday's battle is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's half a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One little thing.  And what a waste, because who cares?  Because the BlackBerrys don't work.  Nobody's using. I mean, they're going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, even that battleground, that is that is.  I mean, look at the BlackBerry is still the number one smartphone,  probably in the in the US.  However, it does sure doesn't feel like the future of smartphones, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. And this is why when I hear that Bing's market share is going up,  I automatically get cynical and think, well, I'm sure that's because of some  Microsoft like like move on.  You know, I'm sure they forced being as the default search on on IE or something.  I'm sure they pulled some kind of move that made that happen  versus actually people switching to Bing because they think it's better.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back to the bubble and, you know, use your VC money,  use your cash to buy as if you could buy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But more importantly, who has the best free food in the cafeteria?  Yeah, that's what really comes down to, according to an article in Gawker.  A string of cutbacks have threatened Google's status  as a veritable Shangri-La of free gourmet food.  Meanwhile, Facebook is ramping up the dining perks.  The Times suggests Facebook might be the new standard  bearer for corporate sponsored dining.  Francis Dinkelspiel tour of Facebook's HQ cafeteria.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She writes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see, Fred Labie, a credit analyst, who arrives at 5 45 a.m.  to reach the European market, says he ate at least two meals,  eats at least two meals a day at Facebook.  The food is fantastic as he savored a plate of scrambled eggs  and a bagel smothered in glistening pink locks.  He put on four pounds in the past six months.  They call it the Facebook 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see data on cholesterol comparisons at Facebook.  Google and maybe that's how Microsoft will kill the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny, I have a friend who was a corporate chef at, where was it?  I think it might have been Lucas, I believe.  Really, this is true that this is like the status symbol  in a really successful company is the corporate food,  especially with geeks, because you don't want them to leave and eat lunch.  That's an hour out of the day.  If you can get them to eat lunch at their desk,  or at least go to the local cafeteria and eat faster, you're better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I maintain that the most innovation is happening by freelancers eating PB&J at home.  You're right. You're absolutely right.  Speaking as one.  That's going to be my mission in 2010.  You're absolutely right.  That's where it's happening.  Foodies gourmet kitchens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talk about fat and happy.  No innovations coming out of there.  But boy, they do eat well.  We've all eaten at the Google cafeteria, right?  At the restaurants.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Have you eaten there, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't eaten at Google.  I've eaten at Yahoo.  I have not eaten at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to a Google event and they had a barbecue out on the lawn.  They have that event.  I miss that event.  They have that event every year for journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, I've eaten at the cafeteria.  Chris Tabona invited me over once and I ate in the cafeteria.  It was sushi and just mind-boggling, wonderful food.  It's all free.  But I wouldn't like it.  I would get so fat.  They don't want you to leave.  I really don't want you to leave.  I'm not going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  I really think that's it.  In fact, here at the Twit Cottage, we have a refrigerator which I'm stocking with delicious  coffee drinks because I realize free caffeine is the single best thing an employer can offer.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And good caffeine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just keep them caffeinated.  We've got an espresso machine already, but I want to make it even easier.  Mountain Dew and Frappuccinos for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  See?  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Free coffee, free oatmeal.  I remember when I knew Tech TV was done when they took the oatmeal out of the cafeteria.  It's like, what can that cost?  A packet of oatmeal in the cafeteria and it keeps people at their desks.  It's not good for you to live on oatmeal, but you could.  So let's look back a little bit at Google in 2009.  This was an amazing year for Google.  Gmail offline.  Google Earth added space and the oceans.  Latitude, it hasn't really taken off.  That's their location-based service.  We watched the Google Books fight go back and forth.  It wasn't anything new, but that's been the big fight.  Chrome was out earlier than this year, right?  But the Chrome OS is new this year.  Wave is new this year.  What else was new this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got the Blogascope.  Is that the one you're going through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at some of the things on here.  A lot of these are just little things like Google's Venture Capital Fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which has started investments.  It did one last week.  Did they?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These aren't acquisitions exactly, right?  These are just investments.  What's the difference?  They don't own a controlling stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's social news gadget.  A lot of it's little stuff.  Things like the duplicate button that we talked about last week.  Google Translator Toolkit.  Wave was huge.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wave was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wave was the big one.  Yeah.  That was probably the big announcement.  And then Chrome OS, although we still haven't seen it, that was just an announcement.  Nothing came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on Android this year.  And Android grew up a lot this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It became serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Chrome, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Data Liberation Front.  We talked about that last week.  Sidewiki.  Oh, there was a stinker.  That's the thumbs down one, right?  Sidewiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's Go, the new programming language.  I mean, I don't know how much traction it got, but still notable.  Yeah.  Programming language, I mean.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sheer volume of it is what's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a long darn list.  I mean, a lot of it's little stuff, but it goes on and on.  This is in blogascoped.com, the unofficial Google blog.  It is a long darn list.  Was this the year that Google goggles?  Almost forgot that.  Was this the year that speed became important for Google?  I think so.  This is when they decided to get fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And lots of developer tools.  Lots of developer tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting because a lot of these were released in the last two or three  months.  We noted that the last couple of months were huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's where I blogged last week, we talked about it a little bit last week, but I start  to see it all coming together.  Singularity here.  Yeah.  Synchronicity.  You use Google's device on Google's OS with Google's DNS to Google's browser, Google's  advertising.  Google knows where you are, knows who you are, knows the context to which you're asking  questions so it can answer the question, showing intent before you even ask it.  You know, it all starts to come together.  I wrote that in the column for the Guardian and I got some predictable email of again  people saying, that's scary.  That's an emotional response, not a rational response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What though, I do think that, what do you think Google's net reputation change is in  Is it positive or negative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a great question.  I think it's negative.  And I think it's Google doesn't understand why or what to do about it because they don't  understand the reaction to huge, the reaction to success.  And they should have, I think, and when I was out there in January for my book event,  it was the one question they asked me about their PR.  I think they were aware of it and they don't really know what to do about it and they still  because they just keep on doing the, you know, we're Google, we're here to help routine and  they don't understand what to do and people don't like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You agree, Gina, as a geek, as a coder, Google's reputation not a negative this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait, are we talking about mainstream users?  Are we talking about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  I mean, you're-  about is a media impression, partly because media doesn't like them.  I think mainstream users-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Media has been taking potshots, a lot of potshots at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a PR problem.  I should have been clear about that.  It's not a reputation problem.  It's a PR problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's why I'm asking Gina specifically how coders and geeks feel about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think coders and geeks love Google and I think mainstream users also, I think that  the reputation is mostly positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mom loves Google.  My mother doesn't go, oh, Google, they're scary now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was having dinner with some friends who are not in tech and one of them said to  me, Google is amazing.  I was typing into the box something I was searching for and it told me what I was just  about to type before I typed it.  She was talking about the-  That's a big thing this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Autocomplete got much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Autocomplete site suggest and with results right there, I mean, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be the single most important thing they did this year from the point of view  of the normal user.  That's what they see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  But amongst the coders and geeks, I think it's been positive.  I think that so many of the tools that made the three major releases this year were open  source.  They're releasing unbelievably cool tools for web developers from Google Web Toolkit  and the Speed Tracer and Speedy and Wave.  These are all super cool geeky toys.  They have me and I think the general consensus is like, this is amazing.  We live in the future kind of feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The question I have back is that if, however, Google's enemies and those who fear Google,  which is, I think, again, emotional, get enough of a PR movement going against it, could it  hurt Google in some ways in government lobbying and the idea that Google's too big?  I mean, no wonder whether there's- because the world loves them, are they leaving themselves  vulnerable and they're left flanked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about the Google Books debacle?  Did that hurt Google this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think anybody really understood what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We barely could figure it out.  It took us eight episodes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jake always told me, don't talk about that on the show, Dad.  Really?  Nobody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody cares.  His generation doesn't.  But I think that we do need to talk about it because I think there are consequences  and as we learned about it and as we understood it better and as understood the consequences  of it better, I think it became apparent that it was an important issue.  But it's like talking about tax code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google realized they went over a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They crossed a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the line was that they controlled something too much.  They put the cloud in the bottle and for them that's not good because they are so huge.  They can't have an excess of control or people will get nervous and we'll start really shooting  at them.  And so hosting the books, even though no one else did it and they thought they were doing  good and I think they were doing good, they got too far ahead of themselves and they have  to start thinking more politically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe this was a coming of age for them in terms of managing their reputation.  That I think they were a little innocent and naive and maybe realized, oh, we can't just  kind of do it because we know it's the right thing to do.  We've got to consider other stakeholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I think that's an issue for them because there can be damage somewhere down the line.  I think you and Gina are exactly right that programmers and people like them.  Business partners will never figure out what to do with them.  It's tough negotiation.  It's what I've said about newspapers is that Google's mistake was trying to make friends  with people who only want enemies.  I think it's proven in a lot of areas.  I think they risk a lot of hassle in the EU.  Europeans are anti-American in some quarters and anti-big in some quarters and they have  the regulatory environment to be able to try to do something about that.  Why they should is another question.  And so you have the French case on the books.  You have the Italian case this week.  You have the EU threatening to go after them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's very intriguing.  I have to say.  I think this is a case of I truly feel like Google was kind of this innocent giant and  stumbled into something and said, oh, and now with this, for instance, this Rosenberg  blog post is clearly and Larry's New York Times op-ed piece, clearly an attempt to kind  of patch this up a little bit and kind of fix the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if that's even the case.  I think Gina said it well before.  It really was just an expression of the way they've been acting and it shows their philosophy.  I'm not sure that there was any.  Some wondered cynically whether the Rosenberg thing was a PR move.  I'm not so sure it was.  I think it was trying to reset perception with reality they see inside.  Gina, do you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that they're maybe trying to be more open about their internal culture.  I mean, I think that it seemed like they were kind of secret about their very own culture  for a while.  I mean, if that email really went out to everybody in Google and they said, oh, hey, we thought  maybe we'd put it out on a blog post as well.  I mean, yeah, I mean, I think that it's a matter of them trying to practice what they  preach and put it out there.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm maybe maybe I've drank the cool.  I think I can imagine what people are saying.  I can just imagine the chat room is saying that I'm just such a Google shill at this  point that I'm secretly getting paid.  I'm waiting for my Nexus one, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'd go for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are trying very hard to be balanced.  But I think on the on balance, I'm trying to hate Google.  And it's very hard to because I for some reason, I believe Jonathan Rosenberg when he says  these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Larry other company come out with that kind of statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  And if if it's sincere, it's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  No one would name another company where that could have happened.  Yahoo.  No.  AOL.  No.  Microsoft.  No one has that kind of philosophy about what the world should look like and how they're  going to help it do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to believe Google's like Santa Claus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to believe that's why they bought him.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that I mean, and you know, I think somebody like John Gruber and we'll get him on.  We'll get him on next week.  I think somebody like John Gruber, who is, you know, like maybe John Dvorak as well,  kind of a paid cynic, you know, has decided I'm going to be skeptical.  And it's good.  We need people to be skeptical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do.  We need skeptics.  We need smart skeptics.  Yeah, absolutely.  But I try to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you see, you know, that's just that's a different kind of that's a different colored  glasses.  I mean, you got rose colored glasses and you got brown colored glasses.  And I think they're both glasses.  And it's hard to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you also look at the rest of the company through those glasses.  If you take Rosenberg's memo and now put it against their business practices, I don't  think it looks so good.  There's no reason they have to be as opaque as they are about their splits and how that  operates again.  Be opaque about how the advertising algorithm works to the extent that you don't want it  gamed.  I agree with that.  But there's a lot that could be more open there.  And they are they are dangerously opaque, I think, in their business dealings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is it's great that they did this post because we can hold them to  it.  So when they're you know, when they're not practicing what they preach, we can call them  on it.  And I think that in a lot of ways, they really did practice what they preach.  I love that they're releasing such major kind of open source projects and and pushing  ahead protocols like speedy and with wave.  I mean, they're trying to reinvent some of the you know, the major protocols that that  run the Web.  And then when they do stuff that shady, we can say, hey, you know, this thing that you  said, how does this apply here?  And he was asking for people to call call them out on it, basically.  So in the post itself.  So I think it's our responsibility to do that as much as I as much as I want my nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  You're not that cheap.  You're not that easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wouldn't sell out for a silly phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I certainly would.  I was totally just kidding about that.  I'm glad they put it out there.  PR move or not, because now they've they've they've set out what the mission is and now  we can we can hold them to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what I've always said about the don't be evil slogan.  If that had been etched over the walls of doors, the doors of Wall Street and insurance  companies, it might have inspired a few more people to hold their companies to some  standards. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a great argument and I think it's something that we're going to continue  to watch and we're going to do our best, of course, to be objective about it and bring  in people like John Gruber to give us to keep us honest.  But I have to say, my leaning at this point is towards trusting Google because they're  doing so many great things and we just trust but verify, keep an eye on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other thing about it is, is that I argue to people who are not sure what to  buy Google. I would say exploit them, use everything that they give you for free, use  everything they can. Now, the argument is you've only then gone into their spider's  web. But I think we're all smart enough to figure out how to use data liberation.  You know exactly back stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Don't do you don't have to trust them forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to start a new blog business, you can put Google ads up, you can drop them.  Right. You can use Google Analytics.  If you don't like what it is, you can always buy a stats package.  Use this stuff to your own advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the good news is that Google is kind of in a way is setting a standard that other  companies, let's hope like Amazon and others, will adhere to.  And then we can use them in conjunction to kind of balance it.  I'll show you. In fact, my tool of the week does exactly that.  Let's you back up your stuff onto Amazon so that you have, you know, they'd all have to  go bad at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of Amazon, if I can go back to the earlier topic I just saw on Twitter, I put it up  on the on the friend feed.  You know, Verner Vogel is the CTO of Amazon linked to how to be a Kindle terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like keep using your Kindle even on the airplane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Is it just like, turn off the wires?  Put it in the Bible, no one will f with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. That's good.  And I don't think anybody yet has figured out how to be how to do anything bad with the  Kindle. It's too primitive to be how to be a Kindle terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, except for remotely deleted books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, Amazon might have, but we haven't quite figured that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the terrorists are as innovative as Google, then we're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny. That's funny.  It was only a matter of time before people started putting up posts like that.  I'm sure there'll be a lot more this week and we will cover it next week.  It might be a slow week next week, but I think this would be a good week to kind of look  ahead to what we would like to have Google do in 2010.  So we'll prepare our notes on that for our next episode.  Meanwhile, time for our tip tool and number of the week, starting as always with  Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have two tips of the week and they're both really light.  It's the last week of the year.  So it's a good time to change your master password and just kind of do a little  inventory. Every most important web apps and other places where you enter passwords  and change your passwords. It's always good.  A little extra security. Make sure your passwords up to date.  That's a good tip.  And then my other tip is last week of the year, a lot of people have some time off,  spending some time with loved ones, log off and relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, sorry. No bad tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wrong. Wrong.  Will not, cannot, does not compute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Log off and relax.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me, I'm going to be trying to play around with hacking projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not on Twitter. What's going on?  What happened? You know, oh, you know, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you really log off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just log off and relax. Oh, yeah, I'm I'm going to spend some time actually  interfacing with other humans, human to human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will interface with other humans, humans, humans,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  humans, eyeballs, eyeball humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am interfacing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Well, good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Family loves you.  Spend time with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, my family's response to me is who are you?  What? Where's where's your Blackberry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let the screen burn. Heal a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, my kid's viral video of the couple who got married and at the end of  the ceremony before they kissed, he pulled out his iPod and the  minister explained that he was updating his Facebook status.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's actually very romantic.  I find that touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the congregation got a good laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty cute.  No longer single.  I like to get sweet.  Your number of the week, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jarvis. Well, Factual.com, which is a wonderful open analysis  platform for any kind of large data pools that are out there, got a whole bunch of  data from Common Crawl, a nonprofit group that that has a crawl of sites and then  count some stats against four million sites that they crawl.  So 28 percent of those sites have Google Analytics on them.  Twelve percent have AdSense.  Five percent have either a Twitter or Facebook link.  And two percent have both Twitter and Facebook link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm surprised that number is so low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I looked at I looked at the actual data and of course, there's a lot  of porn there. So, you know, you have to do the porn exception.  But the 28 percent using analytics, I found interesting.  That means that Google knows intimate details about 20, you know, almost a third  of the sites on the Internet.  Thereabouts. That's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. That's amazing.  My tool of the week now, actually, I want to do a tool of the week responding to  to you specifically, Gina.  No, I won't do it. I won't do it.  No, what?  What was I know?  I forgot now. What was it that you were talking about is getting offline?  I've blanked it all out.  No, I'm going to show you how to back up your stuff online.  This is a great service.  It's free through January 31st.  I think you might have mentioned.  Have you any of you mentioned this?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mentioned last week just briefly, but I think I discovered it from the chat room  on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've signed up since.  And one of the things I like about it is you can back up on their service, but you  can also use Amazon's S3 if you have an S3 account.  So back upify backs up your Twitter, WordPress, Facebook, delicious Basecamp,  Google Docs, Gmail, Zoho, Flickr, Photobucket, all your social networks.  You know, in other words, not stuff on your hard drive, but stuff that's that's on  the Internet that you don't currently have backed up.  And I like this idea of being able to back it up to S3 because that makes me wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina Leo, I have a student in my entrepreneurial journalism class who's got  grant money for a super secret project to kind of organize the data you have.  I'll say no more.  But if you took all of that stuff in to back upify, could you then do meta analysis  against your own data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I presume so.  I don't know what you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it in formats that doesn't I'm going to have to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe it is, in fact, in in standardized formats, because Kevin was saying that it  was the metadata was there.  Right. Didn't he say that that was that was there?  Anyway, I just want to say it works.  I will look at my back upify account and see if it's kind of in a standard form that  we could then, you know, parse and parse your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do other things.  I think it comes back in XML documents.  That's what I think.  You know, yeah, pretty very possible for programmers.  Leo, do you have to give back upify the passwords to all your accounts in order for it to  do its export?  Or does it mean it?  Yeah.  Does it support?  Does it support?  It's a supporter.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it supports OAuth.  So if you have OAuth, it'll support that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like your Gmail account, you have to give it your Gmail.  So this is the part that freaks me out a little bit.  Do you have to give it your Gmail password to log in and get your get your mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't remember.  You give it your Twitter account.  I don't remember.  That's a good question.  I I will find out for you.  I set it up and I didn't make a note of how well I you know what?  I give people my passwords all the time.  So I don't try this at home.  I should have I should have paid more attention to that.  I gave up on that a long time ago.  So that would be a concern.  No, that would be that would be a real concern.  I'll tell you next week.  I'll go back and look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it looks really good.  Just the idea of giving up all my passwords gives me the willies.  But remember how we avoided mint?  Yeah, we avoided mint.  Yeah, same reason.  Yeah, I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a new there's a new Philip Kaplan, the guy at PUD who did, you know,  F company has a new service that I'm a beta tester on called Blippi in which you  give it all of your credit card Amazon and everything accounts.  And then it's Twitter for your purchases.  So so it tweets everything you buy in effect, not on Twitter, but it actually  tells the world what you buy.  And then, but which is weirdly compelling.  You follow people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot like beacon, but done with your control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now they use the same, they use what is the WooFoo backend that mint uses.  So I feel comfortable doing that.  When you set up your accounts, you know, they're not keeping  that information WooFoo does.  So you can give it your Amazon, iTunes, Zappos, Netflix, Blockbuster, GoDaddy,  Wine Library, Seamless Web, credit debit or bank account.  And then it, it, it, it, it affected tweets, everything you buy.  You can follow people comment on their purchases.  It's a really interesting site.  It's in private beta right now.  Um, so I, you know, I'm just kind of like giving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't see your, your, your purchases and your Twitter stream, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it doesn't tweet them out.  Although I imagine that's just, you have to be on Blippi to see what I bought.  But it's, but it's boy, I'll tell you what, talk about monetization possibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's got, that's got a whole lot of cash written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For instance, somebody on there bought a Twittering, uh, scale, weight scale.  And, and Pud pointed out that five people have now bought that scale  ever since the first guy bought it, including me and Pud.  So watch for my weight to be tweeted soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't resist.  Is it?  Yeah.  I mean, so it's a wifi enabled scale that's that you program with your Twitter account.  Yeah.  That's so cool.  So is it, so you put it on the network and you, and there's like a web interface,  like you can figure it like a router and you give it your Twitter credentials.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time you weigh yourself at tweets.  So I have a new account, Leo's underscore scale.  And, uh, and, uh, cause I'm on a diet.  I thought, you know what?  This is a good way to be accountable, right?  It's tweeting every time you weigh yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this, like biometric stuff.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it does, it gives you Leo's underscore scale and it gives you, there's  nothing on there yet cause I haven't got it yet, but it gives you a, I'll get it on Monday.  It gives you a graphs and stuff.  It's actually a very cool scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see why now people buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found, so then there was a little contest going on to see who could have the  smallest purchase and I found one penny HDMI cables on Amazon.  Oh, cool.  So I bet a thousand people, I think bought those.  So, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Social.  Pud's very smart.  Social shopping.  I remember seeing Pud speak and he said, the key is to create a site that once  you set it up and it goes, it runs itself.  You don't have to do any more work.  F company was like that, right?  Everybody posted all the content.  He just sat back and collected the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's got another cool thing is I saw somebody say a user of it that, uh,  you know, he has three credit cards.  He designated one for Blippi.  Yes.  And that's, that's his public.  That's what I did.  I said, you can see the Blippi credit card company soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man.  He's going to make a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So when you want to advertise a purchase, you use your Blippi credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have the, you, you have sharing capabilities.  You can say, don't share this, blah, blah, blah.  There's some, there's some privacy stuff, but that's exactly what I did.  I didn't register all my credit cards because I don't want them to see my porn  accounts, but I registered the, I registered one credit card and I know every time I  buy something with that, it's going on Blippi.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
