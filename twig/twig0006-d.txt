Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig, This Week in Google, Episode 6 for September 5, 2009.  All your O's are belong to us.  This show is brought to you by listeners like you and your contributions.  We couldn't do it without you.  Thanks so much.  It's time for Twig, This Week in Google, the show that covers Google and cloud computing.  There's so much to talk about.  And we as always have a great cast of characters here, starting with Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org,  founder of Lifehacker.  Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Great to see you again.  Good afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good to see you too.  Somebody asked me, do you have any formal relationships still with Lifehacker or is  it just as a kind of consulting, you know, emeritus kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  I write there once a week.  I do a weekly column there and I'm in close contact with the whole editorial staff and  they syndicate posts that I do on SmarterWear on Lifehacker and my name's still on the sidebar.  So yeah, I still feel, you know, really close to the editorial team.  I'm just not doing the day to day, you know, at the wheel kind of stuff, Adam is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably a nice feeling, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sit back a little bit.  At your advanced age, it's nice to relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's good to be a little bit of retirement, kind of, you know, let the  youngins take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis and I are going, Jeff Jarvis is also here.  He is the Buzz Machine at BuzzMachine.com, longtime journalist and observer of journalism  and the author of a great book called What Would Google Do?  A business really, I guess a business book for people who can use Google as their model  for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have the money to pay for books still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like the recent Wall Street Journal still gets subs, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, yeah.  So because it's Labor Day weekend, we don't have a fourth, although we thought maybe Matt  Cutts would join us at the last minute and it's still possible he will.  Google blogger, he works on anti-spam stuff for Google, but also is very out there and  talks a lot about Google.  In fact, we have a lot of great people on tap for future episodes of this show, so there's  a lot to talk about.  I was mentioning just before the show began, we have a FriendFeed room for this show.  As I'm doing with more and more shows, I finally figured out how to use FriendFeed right at  the point where they get sold and are about to go away.  Maybe, I don't know.  But the FriendFeed room is friendfeed.com slash twit dash twig and that's where our stories  go.  Gina, Jeff and I, and actually I've added a couple of other people past co-hosts or guests  on the show and so forth, can pipe stories into there so there's kind of a place for  you to go if you want during the week to see what we're thinking about talking about on  our show on Saturday, but also for us to kind of keep in touch with what's going on.  The way Gina has set it up and I've set it up and Jeff has set it up, we just tagged  something on delicious with the word twig and it goes boom right into the room, which  is really nice.  So Jeff and Gina were going back and forth and Jeff asked for her advice on that.  I just thought it was so gallant.  His response was once again, what was it?  It's like asking Picasso how to paint your barn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that.  Or getting help from Picasso, otherwise known as Gina.  Here I have this little tiny problem and the best expert in the world comes in and fixes  it for me.  Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so kind.  That's too kind.  We're very lucky to have Gina around on our show and of course Gina and I feel the same  about you, Jeff.  Absolutely.  It goes around and so forth.  Are you feeling a little better about Snow Leopard, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am.  I'm feeling better about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wrote some blog posts on it saying it's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I wrote up a post actually in my column at Lifehacker.  It was like, here are the things that you get as a user, not as a developer.  There are quite a few of them.  Actually, my tip this week has to do with Snow Leopard.  It does better seamless syncing with Google Calendar.  So yeah, I am feeling better about it.  I'm running it right now.  I'm using it right now.  It's faster.  It's better.  I like it.  I like it.  Maybe it shouldn't have been free, but $30 was just the perfect price, like I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you and I both heard howls of pain from people like Merlin Mann who, foolishly  as it turns out, tried to upgrade all six of his production machines at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, poor guy.  That was an amazing essay, by the way.  It really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had quite the meltdown.  But I think my message is still the same to people is that unless you see a reason that  you need it, and there are reasons you might want it, there's no hurry.  The problem is the Mac world, everybody just upgrades right away.  It's like, well, we've got to get the latest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve says so, so you do it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the Windows world, people usually wait until they buy a new machine.  There are lots of people using Windows 98 and Windows XP.  There's not that same urgency.  I think Mac people can be told at this point, don't feel that urgency.  You can relax.  You don't have to rush out and get it unless you see something you really need in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I completely agree with you on that.  In fact, there's an update.  There's 10.6.1 in the works now.  They've seeded it out to developers.  I think there's always a little bit of risk of being the early, early adopter.  I don't know.  This is totally subjective, but I think Mac users are generally a little more tech savvy,  a little nerdier, and they want the upgrades faster.  Well, they tend to be enthusiasts, don't they?  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big story of the week was Gmail out for about 100 minutes earlier this week.  I'll tell you, it's funny.  We've come to just expect such reliability and uptime from Google more so than almost  anybody else.  Then when it's down, there are howls.  People acted as if they were going through withdrawal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God died.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was crazy.  I was surprised about it.  It was a little painful for me personally.  It was September 1st.  I had an editor waiting for copy.  I had clients waiting for invoices, but I really didn't think it was that big a deal.  A hundred minutes without your email, it shouldn't be that painful.  I really think that we need to all kind of look at ourselves and think about what's  important in life.  I'm shaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to add a new phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I have an alternate email address.  It's like the world doesn't come to an end.  I don't mean to sound like a Google apologist.  I don't know.  I feel like I'm supposed to do like, oh, the cloud isn't ready now.  I'm supposed to say that we should all be paranoid about putting our stuff in the cloud  because this kind of outage is just an example of the horrible things that could happen.  It was a hundred minutes without our email.  IMAP and POP was working.  I mean, I don't know.  I just didn't think it was that big a deal.  That might make me a bad blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you had an alternate email.  I guess if you didn't have an alternate email, losing your email account even for a couple  of hours in the middle of a work day could be something significant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's a little painful.  I mean, I think this kind of points to a bigger issue about how important syncing your stuff  is, right?  So like IMAP, even if you would sync via IMAP and IMAP was down, you'd still have some  of your mail in your client.  Syncing your address book.  I mean, I have my editor's email address on my local computer.  I can email her from an alternative address.  You could set up an alternative address at another service instantaneously.  I just didn't think it was that big a deal.  I think it's kind of important to have different ways that you ... I'm a big fan and we've  talked about this before about syncing and kind of redundancy and having a local copy  as well as the copy in the cloud for times like this or when you're on the airplane  or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would it be possible to have some sort of failover system?  I use Gmail and other systems, but my main address is through a server of mine.  So it's leo at leoville.com, not leo at gmail.com.  Couldn't you create some sort of thing that if I'm getting mail bounced, then it fails  over to another system?  Something like that.  That might be a good thing to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I'm such a big fan of Google Apps, which is what I use for my main email address  is that it lets you associate your domain name, which you control, to the Google services.  So my email is Gina at GinaTrapani.org.  If Google Apps goes down or I get locked out of my account, which by the way, that's the  thing that I'm worried about.  I'm going to get locked out of my account.  That's much more serious.  Nothing's going to go down.  That's much more serious.  All I have to do is change my MX server, whatever the email setting is, to say, use this service  instead.  And I take my address with me.  I'm not tied to my at gmail.com address.  So I think that's why I love Google Apps is because you have a domain name which is separate  from Google, which you can control and you can point to another place.  Just like owning your own website domain name and saying, this hosting provider sucks, I'm  going someplace else.  And you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have access to your MX record.  There'd have to be some, you'd have to have some sophistication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've always wondered how you do this because my Google Apps account is tied to my Gmail  account.  But you can tie it, can you, how do you get it to tie to a different account?  Can you tie it to multiple accounts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can, so you can set up a Google Apps account for a particular domain.  It used to be called Google Apps for your domain.  That changes the name.  I think it's just Google Apps now.  And then you can forward other email addresses to it.  So you have to have a domain like smarterware.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And you could tell, and do you have to pay for that?  Is that a more professional version of Google Apps or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, there's a free version.  I'm using a free version.  I didn't pay Google.  I mean, I'm paying obviously my, you know, my domain name, you know, registrar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to pay for smarterware, obviously.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to pay for the domain name.  Right.  But I could just tell it to use Google Apps and it's, and there is a free version that  you can associate with the domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're trying to decide in the office because our accountant uses Excel and she's complaining  that the Google spreadsheet is too slow to do a lot of data entry.  She wants to use Excel.  We're trying to figure out, I guess I have to use Microsoft SharePoint.  We're having, trying to figure out a way that we could share that Excel spreadsheet.  I guess that's really, that's where, you know, Google doesn't have those desktop apps that  are faster that you could work with and then share.  Right, right, right, right.  You're tied to the cloud apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  So like Dropbox, I think offers, you know, a syncing service, right?  So you can work on a file.  Oh, we could use Dropbox.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, that's an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have friends who swear by it already.  I play Shurik, he said it's changed his life.  Dropbox?  Having a, just a little tablet now, or I mean a little netbook and Dropbox.  And he's, you know, he's a Mac fan more like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We use, we use Get Dropbox.  We have a 50 gig Dropbox that we use to transfer audio files around and it has been great.  The neat thing about Dropbox is you, it works Mac and Windows.  I think it's kind of like iDisc in the sense that you can have the same Dropbox on all  the computers, right?  Right, right.  So I have a local Dropbox on this machine.  She has a local Dropbox on that machine.  I could share one folder with Clay so he could have it on his machine.  And then, and then if I change any, if anybody changes a folder, it gets changed on every  machine, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  I believe it's how it works.  Yeah.  But, but that would follow the GINA rule that you're synced to a machine as well and so  you have a safety if that's the way it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and you do, you have a, you actually have many copies of the file.  There's issues of locking and so forth, but if you could just say, don't, nobody touch  this I'm using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  Leo, has anybody calculated the downtime percentage for Gmail over a year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  How often are they down?  Is this a common occurrence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's happened a few times, but it's always pretty short.  You know, I was, I visited the Gmail team at the Google campus.  They literally, they have like a siren in the middle of the workspace, like amongst  all the cubicles.  Ka-hoo-ga, ka-hoo-ga!  Yeah, that goes crazy.  Like the minute that there are problems, they're constantly monitoring.  I mean, you know, you get this kind of insight, you know, just having that kind of access,  but it's like, you know, they knew about it right away.  They're going to learn from this.  You know, I don't know.  Again, I feel, I feel a little weird.  I don't want to sound like an apologist, but it's like, it wasn't down that long.  They knew about it.  They took care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Compared to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better than, well, isn't it nice to have that benchmark?  Yeah, exactly.  Everything's better than Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or in its day, of course, Blogger itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, Blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was down, in the early days, it was down constantly.  Was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever since the master of the fail-wailing.  It is.  Ben, Ben Trainer, who is, his title is VP Engineering and Site Reliability Czar at Google  posted on the Gmail blog.  Oh, that sounds like Matt Cutts.  Yep.  I will get Matt Cutts on the line in just a second.  That ding was Matt saying, okay, I'll be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I told him you were hurt that he didn't follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but no, that's not, that's not true.  You don't have to follow me.  I won't be hurt.  I don't take this stuff personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody watching, if you don't follow Leo, I'm telling you to follow Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to follow me and break my heart.  You don't want to break an old man's heart.  So as we get Matt Cutts on the line, let me just, the story is kind of interesting.  Apparently they were putting in new servers.  He says, this morning we took out a small fraction of Google's servers offline to perform  routine upgrades.  Okay, they were upgrading.  While this itself isn't a problem, we do this all the time and Gmail's web interface runs  in many locations and just sends traffic to other locations when one is offline.  But that's what happened.  There was a cascade.  And servers got overwhelmed, shut down completely.  One after another, he says, a few of the request routers became overloaded and in effect told  the rest of the system, stop sending us traffic.  We're too slow.  Transferring the load to remaining routers, which then became overloaded.  And eventually the whole thing was just dead in the water.  And you know, if it weren't for real time systems like Twitter, it might not have been  such a big deal, huh?  The fact that people could Twitter about it, it's kind of what makes such a big deal out  of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting too, that Twitter becomes a backup for Google.  In that case, you did have another alternative means to talk to people.  You could tweet, I have no mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it becomes, you know.  That we should outlaw, I think.  Yes, please.  That's, you know, that was it, Eugenia, somebody was saying like, enough, I know, Google Gmail  is down, stop.  It's all I'm seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It becomes like down for everyone, but just me.com.  It's just people saying like, hey, is this happening for other people too?  Oh, okay.  We're all sharing this common experience of fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what is interesting that I do notice, you know, I think it was John Belmont,  great AP radio guy.  I've known him for years.  Used to be at, was it NBC or CBS or radio news?  Really great.  You know, one of the great voices of radio.  Said think back, you know, for people our age, Jeff, how did you find out that Kennedy was  assassinated or Martin Luther King was assassinated?  How did you learn, you know, these events?  You heard it on the radio.  Nowadays, we learn everything on these real time servers, mostly Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and what was fascinating to Michael Jackson death is that an AP reporter called  me and she said someone came on her bus and said, Michael Jackson just died.  And that woman was then a node in a network.  And all those people became nodes in networks.  When people talk about I heard a podcast this morning, which one it was, it was on the media.  And Ethan Zuckerman at Harvard, who is brilliant and great, was kind of complaining that the  Twitter revolution in Iran wasn't as big as we think, is not as many people used it.  And that's true.  But if you have enough nodes who then talk to networks, it doesn't matter how many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get amplified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  It gets spread on faster.  The more nodes you have, the faster it's going to spread clearly.  But that's what you need is nodes and networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we got Mac cuts.  I think we have Mac cuts on the line.  Matt, are you there?  I think I'm here.  You are.  Yes, we hear you.  Great.  You don't have a camera by any chance, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a funny story behind that.  I'm a PC guy and I tried to hijack my wife's Apple to get the webcam, but I haven't figured  that out on the fly.  So maybe maybe for next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll accept you without a picture.  It's because you're so devastatingly good looking that the rest of us would just pale.  You are too kind.  Hey, it's great to talk to you.  I've never met, we've never met.  Of course, I follow you on Twitter, unlike you.  No, I'm just kidding.  But I read your blog religiously.  What is the great things about you, Matt?  And really, I think it speaks to one of the great things about Twitter is the transparency.  And the fact that you could even come on the show in the drop of a hat.  Most corporations just wouldn't allow that.  Google apparently lets you talk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the nice thing is that I've made plenty of mistakes in communicating for Google,  but most of them I was, you know, it was early on enough that people didn't really pay much  attention to Google.  So now I know not to do at least a few stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your official job?  It's not blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  It's a head of the web spam team at Google.  So in fact, I was spam fighting on, you know, herbal Viagra stuff and then saw the opportunity  to hop on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm so glad you're here.  So you, since you work on the Gmail team, you must have some insight into this outage.  What was it like at Google when this happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I work in the search quality team.  So I work on web spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's spam, not not spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But certainly, you know, we were affected by it as well.  And we use Gmail and Google apps for our domain for internal stuff.  So you know, we feel the pain just like anybody else does.  And so a lot of people are rooting to get that back up as quickly as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear the alarm across the campus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what happened instead is everybody was out in the hallway chatting with each  other because we didn't have email.  It's like a, it's like a fire drill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a bad thing.  That could happen once in a while.  It'd be probably a good thing.  Get people together.  Totally.  Yeah.  So the cascading failure, which is very much like what happens in a power outage where  one by one, these power plants get overloaded and then shut down.  One by one, these routers got overloaded and shut down.  It's amazing that it took so long to get it back up.  I imagine some of that time was just checking database consistency, things like that, kind  of making sure that, you know, when they did go back up, everything was working properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly one of the worst things you can do whenever something goes wrong is  to panic and sometimes that can make things worse.  So it's almost better to take your time and make sure you recover correctly than to just  sort of make new mistakes whenever you're trying to come back from it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think in a way it speaks to the success of Google that this hundred minute outage,  which for Twitter would be just, you know, a day in the life, is a huge story.  And people freak out and say, well, can we trust the cloud?  Oh my God, you know, maybe we're putting too much trust in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you and Gina both made great points, which is that, you know, if you use  Google Apps or whatever, then you can just switch your MX record away.  I love that.  We don't want to lock your data in.  You can always, if you don't like Google, you can go somewhere else to get better service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Kelleher writing on GigaOM said, the five things we learned from the Gmail outage,  one, get used to outages.  Gale forces history to repeat as the internet matures, we expect it to operate more smoothly.  But in fact, this is what happens.  This is how things scale.  Companies get better.  They learn to avoid outages.  But as things grow, new things, new problems occur.  In fact, in this case, according to Ben Treanor's blog posts, Google is expanding capacity,  so they have more peak capacity.  They're telling the routers, degrade gracefully instead of just throwing up your hands and  saying, I can't work here.  So I imagine that this will be handled.  And he says to answer your question, Google is still more than 99.9% availability, which  is pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, what else in life, not to be a Google fanboy, but what else in life is up constantly?  Lord knows my cable operation goes down, my phone comes down, the train goes down.  It's hard to think what stays up constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And who's better equipped to deal with it?  I mean, every company is going to have services that goes down.  I mean, at this point, Google has the scale to deal with it.  I mean, probably the best of all of them.  How long have you been in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a Dr. O's novel a few novels ago.  I can't remember the name of it, damn it, in which there was a massive data failure,  but there was one engineer in Google who kept data alive longer than anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a great short story that he wrote.  It was like the end of the world.  They're all trapped in a big building.  But Google is still working.  That's a great story.  I don't think, is that recent?  I don't know if, I think that was pretty old anyway.  I'll see if I can find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you're right.  It is pretty old.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the only one.  You're right.  It's a great story.  I just love that story.  Lesson two, if you can't stop a crisis, you can't control how you respond.  Gmail may have caused some companies to think twice about paying Google for its apps, which  include Gmail.  All is said and done, Google's swift, forthright reaction to a PR nightmare went at praise.  I think that's true.  In a way, the company's response outweighed the bad publicity of the outage itself.  I'd say now five days later, that's absolutely true.  I don't see a lot of blowback from this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and one thing that I really appreciated was I've seen other outages in the past where  it took Google a long time to acknowledge or to respond or even do a post-mortem.  This time, there was Jeff Huber, who's a VP of engineering at Google and an all-around  great guy.  He was tweeting right in the middle of it just to let people know, okay, it's back up.  The fact that they got the post-mortem to let people know exactly what happened so they  feel a little more confident that we know what was going on live the same day, I think  that's a big step forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ben's blog post was really fantastic.  I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast that night because everybody ... It was a  media outlets are covering it.  I was able to say, well, here's what happened according to Google that night and say, here's  what they're doing about it.  I think that there's a lot to dampen down the panic.  It is a great lesson to be learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought the communication was actually quite very fast, better than I'd ever seen  before.  I also love that Google could say, okay, the web interface is down, but IMAP works.  Yes, pop and IMAP continue to work.  Yeah, pop and IMAP continue to work.  When IMAP launched, I was like, why?  Obviously, Google wants eyeballs to be looking at the web interface.  They want you to look at the web interface.  They don't want you to ...  Right.  You're not seeing any ads in IMAP.  You're not seeing any ads.  They don't really want you to use IMAP, but it's there.  They launched it.  You can use it.  It was awesome.  When it did launch, I was like, great.  I'm going to use a desktop client forever.  The web interface is never going to be good enough, but it is now good enough that it  is my preferred way to get it.  Even when it went down, it was like, okay, you can still get your mail and here are the  settings to set it up.  Now, granted, you had to start digging around in your service settings and whatever, but  you could do it.  Actually, that's what I wound up doing to get my invoices and my copy in.  I just was like, oh yeah, I have IMAP set up and I had my mail.  It was awesome to have that fallback, which Google offers just to increase the addictions,  the product.  They're not showing you ads through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also in the GigaOM article by Kevin Kelleher, item three, big is bad for Google users.  Google has become a crucial part of many work days, but many people had no problem finding  alternatives such as Twitter to the point that Twitter itself felt the strain.  I didn't know that.  Google goes down and what is the joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google gets the fluid, everybody else gets the cold or vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Twitter coughs.  It reminded me why I would hate for Google to buy Twitter or Facebook and other communication  channels.  That's really true.  You don't want a single point of failure.  The electricity is really important, not just in ecosystems, but on the internet too.  It's really nice to have these other alternatives.  That's why I hate it that the friend feed got sold to Facebook, frankly.  Email is finally a utility.  Email downtime is not a life or death matter as a power outage can be.  Still we have come to expect 99.9% uptime.  This may seem obvious because that isn't a coming of age of email in a way.  The corporate email goes out all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there was a really good takeaway just from the fact that as engineers you should  always ask yourself when you have an outage how do you fix it next time?  The fact that we had an apps dashboard is actually because of a previous outage.  We said, you know what, we need to have a way where people can know what's going on.  This time when we did have an outage there was an apps dashboard.  Hopefully you just keep iterating and find new ways to make it a little bit better and  then people say, yeah, email can be a utility because it's up or I have ways to know what's  going on most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google.com slash app status and that's exactly, that's right where I went right away.  You could see that you saw a red X next to Gmail and you could click on it and you could  see what was going on.  That really is a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I did poke a little fun at some of the copy that showed up on the app status  page.  It actually wasn't the first when the downage happened, the longer down outage happened.  It was the day before, I guess there was a really short outage and the copy said something  like this will be fixed in the near future.  Note that this is an estimate.  Please don't believe this.  And I was just like, okay, you know, when engineers write copy, this will be fixed in  the near future, but please note that's an estimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I like engineers.  They don't, they don't mess around.  No marketing speak.  We don't know.  We have no idea what's going on here.  We're doing our best.  We're going to give you a guesstimate.  This is probably when it's going to be fixed.  I think that's great.  I noticed that too.  I thought that was very funny.  And what's really interesting is they keep that information on.  You know, you can go back.  It's still there.  You can go back and see what happened.  Matt, I was surprised because you tweeted, you know, this week and Google's coming up,  getting ready to listen to it.  Why would you, somebody who works at Google, listen to this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  We live, breathe and sleep, search and Google and we think about how to make it better all  the time.  I'm spending this sunny California day catching up on email and everything.  So last weekend I was driving up to food camp.  So I had, you know, three or four hours to burn.  I ended up listening to every single episode of twig and it was just fantastic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess anything better than dealing with spam.  I'm at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, it was, I mean, compared to the radio, man, it's, you know, Mary Hodder and  an Neil Dash and Kevin, you guys had really good people rotating in and just fun stuff.  So it was great to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm really pleased with how this show has come out and I really give credit to Gina  and Jeff and Anne, you're right.  We've had some really great fourth hands, fourth people in our bridge hand and you're  the latest Matt.  So thank you and welcome to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Matt, I've been wondering, wanted to ask you for ages.  Does dealing with spam all the time affect your worldview and your faith in mankind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  You get a little bit jaded and the bad thing is that once you learn how to see spam, you  see it everywhere, including in conventional media.  But the bright side is that it changes your perspective and you try not to, you know,  you think about how to make the world a better place.  So that, you know, there's pros and cons, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's the jury way to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've always been impressed at how gracefully you handle all the web publishers who practically  tackle you at every conference to ask you, you know, how do I get my blog or my site  to show up higher in search results?  And you're always just so, you always have such great advice and, you know, real SEO  advice, none of this like BS stuff.  And you've always been so helpful.  So I've always been impressed with that because they know you kind of hold the keys to not  hold the keys to PageRank, but you have insight in those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, thank you.  It's funny because I literally was someone had emailed and their MySpace layout page  wasn't ranking where they wanted it.  And I had to sort of softly break the news to him that all those ringtones and a  sidebar review that they had on their site could be a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's another way you've improved mankind, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, thank you.  Well, it's a lot more fun to be on Twig.  So thanks for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tone down the tone down the the ringtones on your MySpace account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're glad.  Similarly, I saw this week that one of the links on our list is that Google News put  out a video explaining to publishers how to improve their lot there, including best  practices, explain how things are ranked and so on, which I thought was a new transparency  from Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and I just was reading earlier today your post, you know, Google bigotry  was the title, which is fantastic.  And I think that video is a good first step because we really do want to show the number  one best source.  If there's someone that is providing value add or original research or is the expert  as a news source compared to just reprinting some wire copy without adding any insight,  we definitely want to highlight the original source or the source that is the publication  that is adding some value.  So I think that video is a good first step, but we can definitely do more to talk about  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me quote a little bit from Jeff's post because it really is actually a good starting  point for a conversation.  Google has an image problem, not a PR problem.  That is, it's not a problem with the public, but a press problem with whining old media  people.  Jeff's an expert on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm an old media person, but I try not to whine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never whines, but he knows a few that do.  Google is trying hard, too hard perhaps, not to argue with the guys who still buy ink by  the barrel.  Google is only causing them to buy fewer barrels and newspaper people will use their last  drops of ink to complain about Google's success and to blame it, unfortunately, for their  own failures rather than changing their own business.  What should Google do?  You hear it all the time from everybody from the AP on down.  You know, Google News is killing our business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I got fed up because I got another French reporter.  It's something about the French have a thing about Google.  And the reporter came in and the presumption of the piece was that there was a rising tide  of discontent with Google and that people were going to get mad at Google and go running  to Bing as a result.  As if we make that choice that way.  Well, it's the French.  It's the French.  They are all going to use Bing.  I got another one like this during the week from an Israeli reporter who wanted to deal  with Google's failures.  I mean, you know, it's fine.  I criticized Google in my book for a few pages and there are things to criticize Google about.  But this media presumption that I see again and again, I saw it this week with The New  York Times and the Internet in general, a story that said that this rumor about Chelsea  Clinton's wedding was passed around because of an Internet media culture.  And then the story proceeded to do nothing but quote newspapers, no Internet.  So there's this media presumption that the Internet is bad.  Twitter, Google, Facebook, all these things are leading to a ruination.  And reporters who start with that basis in their stories, I just kind of had it and wanted  to complain about it.  But at the same time, I think that to try to be constructive about it, what should Google  do, pardon the proximity to the title of a certain book?  A fine book, yes.  Thank you very much.  And I think that Google has to do more to prove and demonstrate that it is a friend  of news, not newspapers, but news.  It has so much power to be able to, as Matt said, send links to journalism at its source  and to provide tools and platforms and revenue and R&D and things like WAVE, which we've  talked about ad nauseam here.  And so I think Google has to have a different relationship with news because right now it's  getting hammered by these whiny old news people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not just the newspaper people, the book publishers, too.  And there's now, of course, a fight over this book settlement.  Google had a press conference on Thursday calling for the press to support Google in  the benefits of the settlement.  We've complained a little bit about the settlement because of this notion that it's a public  domain book if nobody asserts the rights to it.  Is that where the debate is all about, Jeff, is who owns these books that are still technically  in copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's most of it.  But Siva Vadanathian, who we'll have on, I think, in a future show, is a far better spokesman  for the problems with Google Book Search.  My argument about Google Book Search, and he and I don't disagree about this, is that  the book industry could have done everything on their own long ago.  And in so many areas, whether it's serving advertisers differently or Book Search, Google  just filled a vacuum, a vacuum that other industries could have filled before it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Authors Guild accuses them essentially of dumping, of price fixing.  They said, well, actually, this is Amazon, but it's the same, let's see, let me get this right.  Authors Guild is settling with Google, I'm sorry.  They are attacking Amazon for dumping books at below cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That now, yeah.  And then I saw that argument in my comments on my blog post today from, I think it was  Daniel Tunkhaling, who said that free is an issue now in terms of dumping.  But in a Chris Anderson free world, we can't accuse every opportunity to give away something  for free as dumping.  Right.  It's just the Internet economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some stuff's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  By its nature.  And if that gets stopped because people want to protect old industries from the benefits,  the Internet dividend, well then we're in big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that the Authors Guild likes this settlement because of course they were  the people who really negotiated this settlement.  They say it's a way to make millions of out of print books available again, which is what  everybody thought was the benefit of this initiative.  And they're saying, look, Google's not going to get exclusive rights to these books because  of the agreement.  Now there's a scan of this book and there's a digital copy of this book, but Google doesn't  assert that we are the only people who can use it and own it.  And they say that's good.  That's going to open a market for these new books.  Now it is going to go to court.  Denny Chin on October 7th, which is a month and two days from now, will preside over a  fairness hearing over this, and maybe a healing.  We can only hope it's a healing.  Hands on.  Between Google and U.S. publishers and authors.  He's the guy who presided over Bernie Madoff's trial, interestingly enough.  Of course Chin is reading right now all of these submissions, all of these complaints,  all these briefs.  Do you think there's a chance that he may reject the settlement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not an expert at this at all.  We'll get Steve on.  We've got to get Steve on.  Yeah, we'll get Steve on.  There's a lot of complaint about it.  There's also a lot of support for it.  And it's a very complicated issue.  There are books going forward that are digital.  My book is online but not searchable by Google, which I kind of don't like.  But I don't like that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yours would not be one of the books scanned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  So we're talking about books from some date prior.  And what happens to them from the beginning of their copyright life until today if they're  not digital.  And that's where the issue really lies.  Things beyond that, it's up to you whether or not to put it up and make it searchable  or do it don't follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The settlement described as the biggest copyright licensing deal in history was hammered out  after American publishers and authors objected to Google's scanning of books without permission.  So Google paid $125 million into a fund.  And publishers and authors can register works, receive compensation from digital book sales  or institutional subscriptions.  Authors and publishers would get a 70% royalty.  Google keeps the rest.  percentage that Apple keeps of the iTunes music sales.  Google says it's going to scan 32 million in print and out of print books.  Wow.  That's an amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the fear is that no one else could have the resource goes this argument to do  that.  And so to put Google in a driver's seat there.  But again, I don't necessarily agree.  If every library in the US chose to scan 10 books, if they could get their act together,  if the book industry could get its act together and scan their own books and put them up,  no, Google wouldn't necessarily do it all.  And they're making it, I think, rather a gift to readers and to knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's the best possible.  I mean, you could say, well, if nobody has, if Google is the only people who have the  resources to do this, then nobody does it, then we don't get it.  Right.  So at least we get this and then we're trying to hammer out a way to make it fair.  And I think this seems close.  Amazon is really the I think is one is chiefly complaining because they want to have an ebook  business in which they sell books.  And they're saying that this is price fixing and violates antitrust law.  In a sense, Google will have a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think a lot of people kind of miss the fact that there is a lot of really interesting  good stuff that happens.  This is not my area as much, but I think on the Google Books blog, they just mentioned  that they released a million books in public domain, open formats.  So that's fantastic.  That's something that a lot of people can benefit from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this is why Amazon hates it.  Because what is the first thing Sony says when they release their new ebook readers?  We've got more books than Amazon because they have this this ePub library from Google, a  million books.  So it is in a way I could see Amazon saying, well, this is bad for business.  Sony can compete with us.  But the truth is Amazon's trying to preserve its monopoly.  They're just lock on all of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon is the one that's dumping by charging under market rates for books and trying to  get us addicted to it.  And, you know, I still get the proper money for my book or when Audible, God bless them,  gives away a book they still choose to pay.  It's not unfair to the author.  But the argument is that it resets the prices for books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, the best test is the EU likes it.  If the EU likes anything that the US corporation does, I think we're I think we've got we've  got a good a good.  But not the French.  Not but the French.  Well, that's OK.  That's their job.  I'm looking forward to I love the idea of having these these books searchable.  I don't even care if the full text is online in that sense.  But the ability to search these books and find out what's in them is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you haven't seen there was a post from 2007 where you could take the content  of books and look for things like cities that are mentioned.  So I can send out the URL in a little while, but you can actually watch Westward expansion  across the United States over, you know, eighteen hundreds to eighteen nineties.  And you can see that the cities that get mentioned spread to the West.  So you can do all sorts of interesting analysis, like spot someone who plagiarized back in  nineteen hundred and never got uncovered until now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's metadata in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool. You can do things like, you know, look at how language evolved over  time, you know, the frequency of words.  You really can do some cool stuff.  That's that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fantastic. I really I love that idea.  Let's see any other stories we want to talk about.  We got the Gmail outage, the book publishing deal.  And as we try to get Siva, who is a good friend of Jeff's on the show.  And but he will be on at a later date.  Of course, it's Labor Day weekend, so a little difficult sometimes.  In fact, we're just glad Matt's stuck with all that spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we got lots of stories here.  You got YouTube is going to be selling movies to I think that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a huge story.  So they're going to go compete against Apple and Amazon and Hulu, in a sense.  What are they going to what movies are they going to have the rights to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it's known yet.  I think it's just reported negotiations, but I think it's an interesting way to try to  make YouTube finally pay for itself and, you know, a bit of paid content there.  Yeah.  And what it says for us as consumers, I think, is we'll have lots of different  places to watch lots of entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're really heading in that direction.  You know, I just got to I mean, it's clearly this is the future.  I just got Roku, which makes that great $99 box.  It you get Amazon and your Netflix streaming now as a deal with Major League  Baseball for 20.  This is amazing for $20 a season.  You get every game and it's streamed.  It's streamed in high def.  It looks fantastic.  You can watch your local.  You can watch any team and you can watch the local broadcasters or the away  broadcasters, you get your choice.  You can watch it later in the day.  You can rewind it.  I mean, TV's and network television's a trouble when these really valuable  assets start moving to IPTV.  And of course, what they do is they disintermediate because now the money goes  directly to Major League Baseball and not to NBC, ABC, CBS.  This is great for the.  I think it's great for the end user.  I love it.  Do you use a Roku box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a TiVo and I've been, I really enjoy watching web video on my regular  TV, so I download like Pogues, New York Times videos and Bitman's New York  Times videos.  In fact, just last night there was an ad for Dignation actually on my TiVo and  I watched like my first episode of Dignation.  So I was going to say to you, Leo, I want to see, I want to see  Twitter on my TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we are going to do it.  We're going to this show and all of our shows, since we make video anyway, we  currently don't offer it for download.  We actually are in the process of, of doing that.  And one of the things I didn't want to do was just be another iTunes download.  So the idea of getting this into somebody's remote control and their big  screen TV is very, very attractive.  Yeah.  TiVo opened that up a couple of weeks ago.  Any, any producer, in fact, you can enter content directly if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can, you can do any, any video URL, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other, the other thing that I do, you know, I'm a big fan of the guild,  just Felicia Day's web series.  And I fire up my Xbox 360.  I'm not much of a gamer, but I turn on the 360 just to download the latest  episode every week.  Like I look forward to it the way I would look forward to, you know, a new episode  of 30 rock.  So, I mean, that, that kind of stuff is like, you know, it makes you really wonder,  you know, the, the, the mesh between network television and web video, you  know, it's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were talking about SEO earlier and how open mad is about SEO.  It's not just mad.  I, you know, I saw this video on the guardian site.  I think Jeff linked to it, a 15 minute video from Google on how they rank news  stories and that's the kind of transparency you don't even get from  newspapers frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the funny thing is a lot of that we've been doing behind the scenes,  even for years, trying to find the best source to show, because if there's one  story, you'd rather show either the outlet that broke it or the outlet that's  closest to the outlet that knows the most about it, or is this the most expert  somehow.  So that video kind of exposes a lot of the hard work that Google is already  doing to kind of send people to the best possible source or publication or  publisher so that, you know, people can find out the highest quality information.  So I think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's moderately new that that part of it.  I think it's very, very important.  We have to say the link economy.  We've got to send links to journalism with a source to support it because that's  where it's going to be monetized.  The problem that the Google news has in day life, or I'm a partner is that the,  the natural reflex is to favor the latest, but the latest is often the AP  rewrite of a story rather than the original reporting where it occurred.  And when AP rewrite stories, it cuts that link to the original journalism.  And so you want to try to suss out where was the original reporting being done?  Where is the value being presented?  And then link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google ranks new, newer articles higher, but does take into account a citation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what I found interesting is they're looking at the citations now to  see if the LA times breaks the story, the more people who quote the LA times on  that story, they're taking that.  I think there's also an opportunity in the closed world of news organizations to  start some measure of metadata about original reporting.  It's very easy to see how that'd be spammed.  And then there's Matt to the rescue, like a white blood cell.  But, you know, I think in a small closed fraternity of news organizations, you  could say abuse this and you're out, but use it wisely and you're going to get  more value to the original reporting.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you see more willingness on the part of news organizations to do things  like make these topic pages, which are sort of a living URL to talk about a story.  So you can get really fresh information, but you can also get a lot of  background and context.  And that's also fantastic because then you have one URL that say talks about the  fires in Los Angeles that can persist for a while.  And so it's not as if this is an expendable URL that won't rank well the next week.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it was interesting, Matt, in the video, they said that they want to see an  ongoing news story, not a top, not, not a permanent topic page for Google News.  However, at the same time you have Marissa Meyer and Google saying that the  article is basically outmoded.  And I've been arguing this in my blog as well.  And then what you need is a one page home for a news story that is constantly  updated so it can gain the Google juice over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think there's room for both, you know, stuff like Wikipedia, they'll have  topic pages.  The New York Times ends up having topic pages, but sometimes having like the  exclusive breaking headline at the top of your title really makes a difference on  getting users to click through as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing Marissa talked about, I don't think I talked about in this show  yet, is the, she, I had all these mockers from, from news organizations out of the  Aspen Institute when I was presenting CUNY's new business models for news  project.  And just as they think they're getting their hands around the neck of the notion  of having a website and a webpage, she blows it all up and talks about hyper  personal news streams and how we have to get our news insinuated into an  individual's personal news stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do newspapers, I mean, it's great that Google's giving them this SEO  information.  Jeff, is it your experience that newspapers are listening to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Newspapers are schizo on this because on the one hand, they want to blame Google  and argue that it steals value and they don't understand the link economy.  On the other hand, they want every link they can get.  They kind of do understand it, really.  I mean, they do.  They do understand it except in France.  I'll stop the French jokes.  Do you have something against France?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they just, they just complain about things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, my book, not to plug the book, no publisher would buy the book because  they all said that they wanted a diatribe against Google.  Right.  I blogged about that.  One publisher came forward and took the book.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was that hard, really?  The market was saying, no, no, no, there's no market for a book that says Google's  doing it right.  There's a market for a book that says how awful Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Cause that's the French presumption here.  When Josh Cohn of Google news goes over to France, he comes back every time with,  with scars on his back as if he's been on true blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How funny.  How funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, um, if you go to Google today, uh, September 5th, you'll notice a little  something strange about the Google logo.  There's an alien abduction going on here.  I don't, I don't know what's going on.  There's a flying saucer stealing the O in Google.  I think it's really interesting what days Google chooses to commemorate.  In this case, for some reason, uh, unexplained phenomenon is the, the,  the, the source for that Google, uh, doodle.  And the funny thing is the very first story, if you Google it is the mystery  of Google's unexplained phenomenon doodle.  Matt, can you explain what's going on here?  What is that flying saucer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was one of the more cryptic logos that I've seen.  I saw it late, late last night and I said, okay, I have to drop an email to the web  masters and ask what's going on.  Um, a couple pieces of speculation that I've heard was there's a Exeter  UFO festival September 5th.  Oh, that's obscure.  It is, but then I think the Voyager also launched on September 5th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those are, and they've, I believe Google's commemorated a Voyager in the  past.  I see, I seem to remember doodles for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it might have.  So truthfully, I'm not a hundred percent sure what the logo is intended for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google tweeted this 1.12.12.25.15211815 a long number.  They tweeted it.  What's that?  Matt, you got to know this.  What is, and by the way, you do know this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  It turns out it's, it's just a simple code where a is one and B is two and C is  three.  So if you decode it, it's, it works out to be something like all your O are  belong to us and ship all your bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the sense of fun.  I have to say, yeah, the playfulness is really fun.  I just think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and have you guys seen the Easter egg where you can search for  recursion on Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the best.  All right, let me try it.  So I Google recursion.  All right.  Let me, let me just see what we get when we Google.  Now we'll do this live Google recursion.  Do you mean recursion?  Yeah.  I mean recursion.  Do you mean recursion?  Yeah.  I mean recursion.  Oh my God.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is hysterical.  We have a geeky sense of humor.  Yeah.  No kidding.  So nobody really knows about this particular flying saucer doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet.  Maybe more details will come out in a day or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Usually when you click it, you get something.  But in this case, it's a recursive, another recursive response, which is  mystery of Google's unexplained phenomenon doodle.  Who has to approve that map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, it does have to go through an approval process.  So it's not, I don't think it's a rogue webmaster or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Marissa who says yes or no to these are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that re that team reports up to her.  I don't know whether she approves every single doodle by hand these days, but  there's a doodle team at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, unfortunately, but not, not surprisingly, there's a lot of, can it  even be controversy over these doodles?  Your choice to honor some holidays, but not others.  And you know, why do you have a flying saucer for this, but you don't have a,  you know, a Ramadan doodle or whatever it is.  Um, so it's funny.  You can't just have fun, you know, nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you also, the other one Marissa tweeted last week, if you Google ask  the art, take a look, do that one too.  Oh, I love this.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it when engineers are, don't you love it when engineers are in charge,  Gina engineers should always be in charge.  They take over the world.  Take a look at the logo and the ASCII art is ASCII art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's yeah.  See Saturday, Labor Day weekend.  It doesn't get better than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holidays, weekends, we look for strange Google search results.  I think it's hysterical.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, I wanted to ask you what the kind of to change the subject a little bit.  I was curious to know what kind of phone you use, what kind of phone operating  system you use and what the culture like at Google is around the Android.  I mean, is everyone walking around with an Android phone?  Um, is it cool if you have an iPhone or I know, you know, at Microsoft  there for a while, like people couldn't have an iPod.  There are some, there's some rumors about that.  So I'm curious to know what that's, what that's like on campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Uh, it's funny because, uh, Google is pretty heavy towards, uh, Android and iPhone.  So for Christmas holiday last year, everybody got an Android phone.  And so you see awful lot of Android phones around, but people don't look at  you sideways if you have an iPhone, I have both and I kind of go back and  forth on which one I use, uh, there's some really great programs like, uh,  listen just came out for Android, which is a great podcasting client.  So you could, you know, download twig and you can either stream it or  download it and listen to it in your car later.  So it's Android is really coming along.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  So it's nice to know you don't get the stink eye for using your iPhone.  What, what, uh, what handset did you get, um, on that phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a developer version of the G one, which is nice because it's unlocked.  So you can use the Android scripting environment, which lets you  program Android with Python.  So you don't have to write hundreds of lines of Java code.  You can write like, uh, a proximity detector and 10 lines of code,  which is really a lot of fun.  So there's a lot of people that tinker with Android for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet the Google search app on Android.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I was just going to say the Google shoot.  Okay.  One more time.  All right.  I'll start then you, I was just saying that the Google app search app on the  iPhone is, is, is easily better than the one on the Android.  I mean, it's a really, it's the one with the voice activation and all that.  It just really works really, really well.  So obviously some Google engineers have iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And the voice recognition has gotten a lot better.  A lot of people sort of railed at it when it first came out, but what we've done  is by using voice recognition data over time, it's gotten remarkably better to  the point where I I've made a video and I'll, I'll post it at some point in the  next few weeks where you can do like six or seven queries in a row and it will  nail each query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I've noticed that.  And you're using data from a Google voice to improve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've said that we use Google 411.  I'm sorry.  Google 411.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then also I think the voice recognition app at Google mobile app itself will use.  So I think a lot of Googlers volunteered to help out and read a whole bunch of  queries to help bootstrap it.  But then beyond that, you can use the data to help improve search quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I have to say, you know, with Google voice, sometimes the, and it's a  challenging environment because you're listening to voicemail messages, but the  transcriptions of some of the voicemail messages are quite humorous.  In fact, I think there's a meme on friend feed of comedic Google voice  transcriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They get kind of funny.  The cool, the cool thing though about the Google voice app for Android is that the,  the words and the transcript are a darker color, the more sure Google is of them,  which is really cool.  So when you play it, it's kind of like karaoke, you know, like you can see the  words kind of highlight as it plays, but I wish there was a way for me to say like,  no, this word is, you know, my name is Gina.  It's not Tina, that kind of thing.  Right.  Kind of give it feedback, but maybe in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That could be your, on your wish list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It felt like the, uh, the voice transcript voicemail transcription in Google voice  right now is still sort of the one point O version, but if history is any guide,  it will probably get better over time.  So that's definitely something that would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one from a Lindsay on friend feed.  My funny Google voicemail transcription for the day.  Quote, my name is comma Chuck, and I am at the lots of Walmart branch over at  gorgeous nipples and thank you very much.  You know, it never bothers me when I get transcriptions like that.  It's kind of almost a challenge to figure out what it was that they said.  And then you can always listen to the vote, the audio.  It's always fun.  I enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's like sometimes you can, I don't expect it laugh and I don't have  to listen to my stupid voicemail.  I mean, that's the best part is like, I don't have to listen to it unless it's  really bad and then, then you do have to listen to it.  But yeah, it's just kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one.  You're welcome.  Pretty good.  Get out.  So Jeff, I'm sorry I interrupted you.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I was just going to say son, Jake wanted one of those developer  androids and I think you can buy them.  Can't you?  Um, but there's some limitation if you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's pretty interesting.  They make the developer Android available for last I checked.  It was $400 less price.  It might be lower now.  And the nice thing is that lets you control basically everything.  You can flash from, you can do almost everything that you want as a consequence.  They don't let you buy paid apps from the market because if you did and you have  complete control of the handset, then you could presumably pirate some binaries.  So that's the choice.  That's the trade off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the other news is that a sprint announced it's using the HTC hero.  Um, I'm looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks like a nice handset.  It does.  It looks very nice.  The problem with Sprint.  A real headphone jack.  Hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So would you go to Sprint, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I might.  I might.  I would check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So customer service is so awful.  And yet they have the, I think they have the best data of all.  I think they're even better than Verizon for data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I have a good data plan.  The problem is you can't use it in Europe.  It's not a, it's CDMA.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They may, I don't know about the hero that, you know, you can't, it's possible  to make Verizon sells them a multi-band phones that do both.  You know, they have some world phones.  I don't know, but no sprint does that.  It, who cares?  Just get it.  Who cares?  Let's see all the things.  So you're going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, Gina, you're, you're.  I'll buy one.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  When's it come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll at least go to the store and, and, and handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like, it's like daring you to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I suppose.  Yeah.  I suppose I should say something, you know, judicious, like, oh, I  should try it first, but no, I'll buy it.  I don't care.  No, it's part of my job.  I gotta, I gotta, let's see.  Uh, I'm just seeing if I can find the release date.  Best buy will offer it.  October 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's soon.  All right.  I have a sprint account.  I have an account on all the carriers.  Just, just for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's your communications bill?  Oh, you don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't even imagine.  No, cause it's my job.  It's beautiful.  It's a, it's a beautiful, uh, you know, uh, excuse.  I just, you know, I, well, honey, I have to have all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the other end of the spectrum.  I unlocked my G1 so I could use my AT&T SIM with it because I was too cheap to  pay the, you know, the contract termination fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I do feel guilty.  I mean, my G1 is sitting behind me.  Just, you know, I leave it on the charger.  Just sits there.  There's a new, uh, now this is sad.  The next update firmware update will not be available for the G1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that true?  Has that been confirmed that don't work on the G1?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do not.  I don't think that's been confirmed.  I think what happened was someone tweeted and said, we can't 100% promise  that it will be supported.  And someone wrote that as donut won't be supported.  So I, I don't know what it is one way or the other, but the only substance that  I've seen the tweet said we can't guarantee, which is completely different  from it definitely won't work.  Stupid me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should never believe those tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounded like a developer.  Just really nervous.  Like, how are we going to make this thing small enough to fit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that, would that be the issue of size?  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it would be.  Yeah.  I mean, I haven't looked at it myself, but you know, some of these  ROMs can get a little larger, but, uh, you know, certainly I'm sure there's  people on Android trying to make sure that it does fit.  So I don't know the status one way or the other, but, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cupcake was a huge upgrade.  It really made a big difference.  I think then usability really liked that a lot.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to get a hero.  So what do I care?  Well, the here is, is, will donut be done for the hero?  Will it be a donut phone or I love just saying donut.  Will it be, will it be a donut phone or will it be a cupcake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a, I, I don't know.  My guess would be donut, but, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  seems like that would be the timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  What?  Oh, this is so good to have Matt on.  We think of all the things I can ask him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the Google questions we've had for so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't put you on this.  I won't, I won't make you do that.  We'll put you on the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, although, which cafeteria do you eat in Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  43 most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Building 43.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Which one is, which one's 43?  What, what kind of food they have there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, uh, there's Andalay, which is great burritos.  Uh, there's no name, which is fresh food, but, uh, Charlie's is one of the famous  ones because they have so many stations.  You can just browse around and get a little bit of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So jealous.  I would be so fat if I worked at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  I am.  Do you read the green, the green marked stuff, Matt, the good stuff, or do you  have symptoms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, no comment.  A lot of people joke that there is the Google 15 because there's so much good  free food that you gain 15 pounds.  But the nice thing is they have a very nice workout gym as well.  So I've, I've been maintaining, I haven't been gaining too much weight.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't, I won't put you on the spot with the, the Google Apple voice thing.  Although wired.com apparently is, uh, is doing a sunshine request to get, you  know, Google redacted its answer.  Oddly enough, since Google was the victim in all this and Apple seemed very, you  know, Apple gave a lot of details.  Google said redacted.  Um, so everybody's kind of curious.  Well, what was it that they, uh, what they were dacted?  So, but, but I'm not going to put you on the spot for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, that's not something we should, uh, we should talk to Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, it's not my area.  You know, if I had to guess from the outside, probably they were trying to  respect whatever the replies from Apple were and not exposed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was very genteel, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, uh, but I have no direct knowledge.  I'm afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Here's one.  When am I, when are we, when are we going to get invoice invites on Google  voice that we can send out to her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wave or voice.  I want my wave in wave.  I want, and I think that's coming soon.  Isn't it?  Do I have to do write a frigging book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got scared this week when I saw last week, Adrian Hall of Adi, who did every  block said that it looked like a Google wave was too complicated for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not a good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I showed two people around Google wave this week, uh, with my test account and  both of them, like within the first five minutes were just like, Whoa, Whoa.  Whoa.  Good.  Whoa.  Bad.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Like what is going on here?  One of them was like, can I please call you on the phones?  We can talk.  Yeah.  But you know, I think it's, I think there's a little bit of a, of a learning curve,  a wave is it's cool.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and some of it looks scary.  Like the scroll bars look different, but you know, once you start to wait in,  it's, it's not that much.  And what's also nice is when you have a lot of people, you get that network  effect where everybody's talking on a wave.  Whereas if you just by yourself, that's what I'm, yeah, there's no point really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I w I'm not excited to have an invite until the a hundred thousand people  get their invites and then it'll be a interest.  So Gina, you've had one for a while then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've had an invite for, for, for a while, thanks to some good friends or someone,  I don't know, an angel.  I'm not really sure actually how it happened, but and yeah, I've been playing  around with it and you know, you get an account and it's for developers.  So you get an account and you get a test account so that you can test bots that  interact between two different accounts.  And I'm playing around with it and I've talked, you know, not a lot of my friends  are on it because not a lot of people have invites.  So I haven't, you know, I haven't done, you know, I haven't spent a whole lot of  time in there, but I'm going to do, I'm going to do a little talk of like a Q and  A session at a local tech event here in San Diego this week.  So I showed a couple of people around in it so that, you know, just to prep for  that this week.  So, so I like it.  I mean, it's amazing.  It's still kind of a long ways to go.  I actually, when I logged in this week, it had been a few weeks since I had, and I  kind of expected to see maybe a little more, a little more progress.  So, you know, I don't know, it'd be interesting to see.  They said later this year would be the launch.  I don't, I'll be impressed if that happens.  I don't know.  I don't know if you know anything more about that, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they've been setting themselves pretty aggressive goals, partly  as a forcing function to make sure that they do get out.  Like, you know, for Google I.O., they said, well, better to get it out there and  start getting a lot of people trying it than, than to hold onto it for too long.  And, you know, end up with something that looks really polished, but the rest of  the world can't use.  But, but going back to Google Voice for a minute, Leo and Jeff, if you guys don't  have invites, maybe, you know, direct message me a Gmail email address and I'll  ask around and see whether we can do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just also for just in general, because I mean, this is such a great service.  And I was so happy as a long time Grand Central user that Voice came along  because you've really improved it.  It's a wonderful service, very useful.  But I just would like, for instance, I'd like everyone in my family to have a  Google Voice number because I think it'll be the last number they'll ever have.  And so, so are they going to put invites on the page?  I guess is the question.  You know, are you going to give users invites as they did with Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it worked really well with Gmail because they could control using the  invites just how fast it grew so they could throttle, you know, according to  machine capacity.  So I think that model makes a lot of sense, whether that's the exact model  they'll use, I don't know.  But, but it did work well for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope they do that soon.  I think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, I got a question for you.  If you've now that you've used Wave and I'm jealous, there's some argument that  sometimes you can release a beta too early.  There's a long time to release it.  Do you think Wave was released too early?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Not to the developers that are released to.  I mean, I don't know what the numbers are, how many people are on there, but I think,  I think it, it, it, Wave is such a big paradigm shift.  I think it needed to go out early so that people could start getting ready for it  and start thinking about the possibilities and really, and really test it out.  I'm, I don't know, maybe too, maybe too much of an extreme.  I'm a big fan of just releasing, releasing early, you know, as long as something  works kind of just enough to get the idea across.  And I think that Wave does.  Um, but it's broken.  I mean, I've crashed it a few times and you get the error messages are  funny actually, um, and you know, when you try again and it's like, okay, this  is a beta and these are developers here, you know, working on it, but no, I didn't  think it was, I didn't think it was too early.  It's actually kind of neat to see, to see Google do that.  So it's great to say like, Hey, here, here it is.  Works and all.  Yeah.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is something that you need to kind of, uh, work in, in, work out in a,  with a large group, you can't just kind of try it in a small lab.  So I think that you need to do this.  You know, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you need the early adopters, the developers, the tech savvy folks who see  the value to, you know, to, to see it grow up and to get in there and to have that  kind of paradigm shift and then to, and then to, you know, show other people.  And then much like Gmail, you know, when that went out and there were just  invites that went out, I think that, you know, that you really kind of had these,  uh, you know, early adopters say like, look how cool this is.  Look at conversations, you know, look at conversation view and labels, you know,  that kind of thing was such a big, it was a big deal back then.  Remember that?  I mean, it was a big paradigm shift.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  How old is Gmail?  How old is Gmail now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  April 1st, 2004 is when it started out.  So five years.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was April Fool's Day and everybody thought it was a joke when it was first  announced.  I remember that.  So is this a joke?  Maybe that's not a good day to launch a new product just for future reference.  And blogger, you were just saying bloggers, uh, 10 years old, right?  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10 years old, 1999.  That made me feel really old.  God, I remember when I, my first blog was on blogger.  You don't know what old is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff and I are going,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody's first blog was on blogger, right?  It was, it was Leo, Jeff, you guys both started on blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it was my first blog.  It certainly would be, would have been one of the very first, if not, I think I  used gray matter, uh, first and then I used blogger.  Okay.  Okay.  Maybe it was the other way around, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blogger was definitely the product that I used to go like, is this thing on,  you know, hello world in my first blog post ever.  So I have all this, you know, kind of nostalgia about it.  And I actually, I went on to work with, uh, with, with Meg Hurahan for  quite some time after that.  So it was really cool to spend time with her and hear about, you know, what the,  what building blogger was like, but you had 10 years.  I couldn't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was interesting Meg and, and, uh, and the third founder, who's the fifth  Beatle, I forget his name, uh, all forgot about the anniversary.  Yeah.  And it was about three days later when they said, Oh, that's right.  It's been 10 years.  That's pretty typical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The world.  That's pretty typical.  Yeah.  That's not unusual.  Actually, by my experience, it's the other people who noticed, not the,  not the people who did it, you know, they've moved on there.  They're doing other stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other birthday was this week was Chrome as a year, a year old.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Chrome.  And I've been using the Mac version and it's very stable now, or at least, you  know, it's, it's totally usable now.  I'm really happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're shipping with the bio.  So the bio is going to ship with Chrome now.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In, in lieu of, uh, well, no, no, I got all excited when I read  that I thought, man, a bio with the Chrome OS.  And I got all excited.  Then I said, no, no, it's just the Chrome browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my question is when Chrome actually, you know, officially supports extensions.  So the, so the, the version of the dev channel does right now, but when it  ships, you know, the, the, when the, when the final version ships extensions, is  it going to get as slow as Firefox?  This is, this is my, this is my worry and my, my interest in this.  Um, because Firefox is just, it's slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the extensions have blogged it, bogged it down.  I think there's a, maybe it's just a software like anything else gets old.  Over time.  And as it accretes, uh, you know, new features and extensions and stuff,  it just starts to bog down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I just saw a tweet from Katherine Corick, who's a online  media person in the UK, uh, and she said, Oh, good grief.  I'm about to give up on Chrome currently varying one to 50%, one to  57% CPU nine processes, only six tabs open, not refreshing pages.  So yeah, it does slow down sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the cool thing about Chrome that I wish the Firefox has is that, that  ability to sandbox that, you know, the tab that crashes, right?  That's the really cool, really cool feature that I'd love to see.  And so they could sandbox the add-ons in a similar way.  That would be, that would be revolutionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I believe that is one of the features of Safari and Snow Leopard.  Now is that those processes, if they crash, it does not crash the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is funny.  Oh, go ahead.  No, no.  I was going to say, Matt, you're a full-time, your full-time Chrome user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, nothing but Chrome.  I had to fire up Firefox earlier today, which I love and used before Chrome.  And I counted and it took 20 seconds to fire Firefox up from a cold start.  Uh, and certainly Chrome does, you know, sometimes run into issues, but that,  uh, Jeff, that tweet that you read out, boy, in my experience, Chrome is much,  much faster, especially for stuff like Gmail.  So I have to stop myself from sort of, uh, you know, talking about Chrome too  much because I just, I'm a really big fan and, uh, when you add extensions,  yeah, you have to be careful.  I don't think you want to add too many or else it could slow down, but, uh,  just on a day-to-day basis, every time I open up a new tab, it's so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just, I'm a big pro.  Is there a limit to the number of tabs you can safely drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I've hit, but I try to be pretty good hygiene.  I've only, you know, I don't keep more than 20 open at a time or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty common that, uh, geeks have hundreds of tabs open at once.  I think we will hear if there is a limit, we'll find out fairly soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Matt, you don't miss your extensions, your Firefox extensions at all, or, or  to take a little time for you to get used to not having, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'd miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, my brother is a mechanical engineer at a, at a company that makes  laser printers and, uh, I went to visit him at work one day and he hadn't even  changed his, his background image, his desktop wallpaper, and, uh, I realized  sometimes we get so caught up in, in being more productive that it, you know,  we spend more time on that productivity.  And, uh, and so every time I've gone back, I think Chrome has made good  decisions where, you know, maybe I'd prefer that the tabs open all the way to  the right instead of right next to it or something like that, but in general,  once you get past that, if you can take that leap and say, you know what?  There's no one extension that's so incredibly useful.  I can't do without it.  Um, boy, it's the speed more than makes up for it.  I will be glad to see extensions get finalized though.  Something like flash block stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think, uh, for, I mean, there's so many things we could talk about still.  There's still a lot of stories.  We, we, we've started talking about donut, but we didn't talk about  the new Google marketplace.  Maybe we'll table that for another day.  Cause we want to start wrapping this up, uh, with our usual wrap up, which is,  uh, starting with Gina's tip of the week.  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the tip of the week this week is for Mac users who upgraded to snow leopard.  Uh, now an ICAL, you can sync your Google calendar, which supports Cal  dev in, in pretty much just one step.  And I, and I've had the screenshot on my, on my site, which will include  the link in this, in the show notes.  But basically in ICAL, if you just go to, uh, preferences and settings and accounts,  you type in your Google account credentials, whether it's a vanilla  Gmail account or Google apps account.  And your, your Google calendar shows up on ICAL.  It's two way sync.  So any changes you make, you know, in the web interface or within  ICAL, you know, get sync back automatically.  And it's, and it's a lot easier in 10 six in snow leopard, uh, that it wasn't leopard  and leopard, you had to know some, you know, Cal dev server settings or you had  to install this, this, uh, separate application, but, but right now it's  one thing that's no leopard did really well was make that that synchronization  super easy and you can also sync.  And I didn't, I didn't note this in the post, but you can also sync your address  book to your Google contacts very easily too.  And that was available on leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And in fact, now that they've got both of those, you know, in address book  and ICAL, you just give it your Google credentials and you're done.  That's really the way it ought to be.  I think that's a huge improvement.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  I did that immediately.  Now I use a program.  I used to use busy sync Merlin man recommended that to sync my  calendar, uh, with Google Cal.  Now they've come out with a standalone calendar application for the Mac called  busy Cal, and I've been playing with that.  And it's like a little bit better than ICAL with the built in sync, but I don't  know, I mean, with, with this built in now to ICAL, I don't know if they're  going to have a market for busy Cal.  Jeff, you're a number of, by the way, smarterware.org that's Gina's blog  and the, and her tip and screenshot.  Oops.  Her tip and screenshot are right there on the, uh, on the webpage.  Smarterware.org.  Now it's time for our number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, first off by the Jarvis family wants to thank Gina because Jake  installed your tip from week before last on a permanent, um, um,  little tiny tab windows.  Isn't that cool?  Yeah.  That's great.  Awesome.  Great.  Cool.  Um, so, uh, the numbers one in 51, one is that Google news added a new language,  which is Arabic, which I think it may be important for the world.  And then, uh, Google translate at the same time is now speaking 51 languages.  They've added, uh, Afrikaans, Belarusian Icelandic, uh, which actually I would  find very handy during the crisis.  I wanted to read some Icelandic sites, Irish, Macedonian, Malay, Swahili, Welsh,  and my favorite Yiddish.  Finally, some good cursing out of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who does anybody publish?  I mean, is there a Yiddish paper out there?  I guess there must be.  Gotta be.  Yeah.  That's cool.  So what's your experience with those translations, the quality of those  translations, Jeff, I mean, you, are you able to read newspaper articles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but, but, you know, it all starts and ends with my ego.  And so if I see, uh, you know, a French site complain about me, I can go on to,  to, to translation tools and get a sense of it.  Right.  My German is really, really bad, but I use it to supplement and help out my  translation.  So it's, it's a good aid and I have to believe it will only get better.  I'm surprised there aren't more feedback tools.  It's what Gina said before about wanting to tell, um, the transcription of  messages, uh, that she's Gina, not Tina.  Um, similarly here, I wish I could tell, we could all tell Google translation when  they got it right and wrong and how to improve the syntax, but I guess it's more  complicated than one for one word swap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  But boy, that would be the way to make it better.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I use it.  I use it exactly as you do.  My French isn't great.  So I'll kind of give it, use it to get a little jog and then take that and say, oh  yeah, that's right, but maybe I need to change that syntax a little bit.  And it's been pretty good.  It's pretty good on French.  I asked my daughter who's fluent in French and she wants to learn Arabic next.  So there you go.  And, uh, my Google tool has been around for a couple of months now, but boy, uh,  something people probably don't know about and should know about is Google  Squared.  This is a new way of looking at a search result.  If you go to google.com slash squared, uh, it gives you a kind of a spreadsheet  table of results, which in some cases is really good.  The, this, for instance, use the sample that they offer of roller coasters.  You can get a list of roller coasters and in the table, you get a, a, a column of  images, descriptions, height, length, and so forth.  I mean, this is amazing that this does this.  What a useful way to get some information.  You can even export it out to your Google spreadsheet.  Um, I love Google Squared.  It depends on what you're looking for it.  You know, obviously it works best for data where there are a number of  representative, uh, items in the set.  For instance, uh, us presidents.  And here it gives you a great table of us presidents and that sort of thing.  Google Squared, a very clever way of, uh, tallying Google search results data,  you know, in a much more useful way.  Just shows you, you know, once you get the data, it's as, as you were saying  about the Google, uh, book initiative.  Once you get the data in there, the sky's the limit on the kinds of massaging, uh,  you can do and manipulation you can do to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of great structure on the web and there's a lot of fun things still  to be discovered about how people, you know, work well on the web and, uh, it's  just, it's exciting that people can do a lot more now than they could even a few  years ago, like when, uh, Gmail rolled out or when blogger rolled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, I'm so glad that we were able to get you in through the good graces of  Twitter direct messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
