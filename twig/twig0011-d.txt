Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This Week in Google, Number 11.  What's the matter with this picture?  Where's Leo?  Leo was off in Dubai, studying himself and having kebabs, I'll bet, and having a good time.  So you're stuck with me trying to sit inadequately in his shoes.  But thank goodness we have for the rescue, as always, Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello, Gina.  I'm missing Leo very much.  Gina has a fancy new microphone.  Yes, I've got a fancy new microphone today and it is a little weird to be here without the president of the internet, but we have some awesome guests, so I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be good.  Mikki Nappoon, why don't you introduce guest number one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guest number one, I'm assuming, will go with Liz.  Liz.  I'm Liz Lolley, a friend of mine and a brilliant person who I've been dying to have on the show, and we have a really good reason to have her on the show.  She's got this excellent project, which I can't wait to hear her talk about today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then guest number two, we are delighted to have Matt Cuttsback from Google.  Having had approval, we have the new hairless Matt.  What's the deal, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I lost a bet, and so I have a good aerodynamic coefficient of friction now.  I can swim very well.  I can cut through the air very efficiently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it cold, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can get a little cold.  Yeah, I need to get a little cap or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, why don't we start with Liz's project, because it's exciting and a new kind of way to tie the virtual and the real world together.  So Liz, why don't you give us the URL and the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so the URL is picturetheimpossible.com.  And the basic idea behind it is we decided at RIT that we wanted to work with our local newspaper to essentially try to save newspapers, which was a small goal.  That's Rochester Institute of Technology and Rochester.  That's correct.  Rochester Institute of Technology.  I teach in an interactive games and media department there, and I run the lab for social computing.  And the newspaper wanted to do something collaborative with us.  And I said, how about an alternate reality game?  And they said, that's a great idea.  Let's do it now.  And then I had this moment of panic because I've, of course, never actually built an alternate reality game.  I've only played them.  And suddenly I was in charge of one.  So we've been working with them for about a year now.  And the game launched in September.  And the whole point of the game is to try to make the newspaper more relevant to audiences that haven't cared about it in the past by integrating the community features of what it does, the news aspects,  and really connecting people up with the tangible aspects of the paper as well.  So every week we do online games, which are sort of the simple, less exciting parts of it, everything from slider puzzles to jigsaw puzzles.  But we also do scavenger hunts around the city.  We do a set of really challenging puzzles in the paper, including some that are spread out over multiple editions and multiple weeks.  So the people have to collect the paper and assemble the puzzle pieces together.  And then lots of individual challenges where we print our players winning photographs and screens from their videos and things like that in the paper.  And the newspaper has totally stepped up on this.  And in addition to helping a lot with the development, they've also devoted the entire back page of the sports section every week for seven weeks to coverage of the game so that the game has become really an integral part of the paper.  And what we're seeing is a big bump in the number of people buying single copies of the paper.  And now what we don't know is if when they stop with the game, they will keep getting the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this isn't the paper itself. Pardon me for being, you know, cyber guy, but a little bit irrelevant as long as they maintain a relationship with each other and the community through the paper brand.  Isn't that a real victory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a huge victory.  And we're really excited about what's been accomplished.  I mean, what we're seeing in terms of the level of commitment and enthusiasm and engagement of the users has been huge.  The time spent on site is much better than what they get in the normal paper site itself.  But also people are really thinking about talking about aware of the paper in a way that they weren't before.  And, you know, in a perfect world, what I would love to see is for for game developers to become part of newspaper staff that that do this on an ongoing basis that if the only reason people are buying the paper is because of the game.  That's great.  There are people who only buy a paper because of the sports news or because of the local news or because of the comics page.  There's no reason that the game can't be equally important.  And we're really trying to play with the tangible aspects of the paper to folding things, building things, playing with the physical aspects of the paper itself.  And so far, it's been really successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did a big project at City University of New York where I teach in new business models for news that I've mentioned on the show before.  And we used kind of some industry standard numbers for engagement with newspaper sites.  And it's sinfully low.  Newspaper sites run about 12 page views per user per month.  Compare that with Facebook, which is 12 per user per day.  And if we think that newspapers are truly involved in part of their community, that's the demonstration that they're not.  So making games, finding new ways to bring people together, new ways to be of the community.  That's what a paper is, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's what we're hoping.  You know, we want this to be deeply engaging.  We want people to see the paper as relevant and as connecting them to other people.  And we're seeing some really amazing stuff.  I mean, at this point, we're only we're about halfway through the game, little over halfway.  And so, you know, a lot of it is still anecdotal evidence until we can sit down at the end and crunch all the numbers.  But it's, for example, very common right now for groups of people from the game to get together in local coffee shops with the Sunday paper to solve the puzzles together as the puzzles get harder and harder.  And they need collaborative help in solving them.  Today, Alon Leaf, who's one of the pioneers of ARG development, was in town for the weekend to give a talk.  And he and I went and did the scavenger hunt downtown and bumped into a whole bunch of people who were walking with their papers,  with their mobile phones, doing our scavenger hunt and connecting to the city and to each other.  And so we're seeing really deep engagement from people.  We had one hundred and fifty people create photos of horse statues around the city and submit those the very first weekend of the game when we first launched at something we thought hardly anybody would do.  We asked our players to take pictures, including at least three firsts from Rochester.  So, you know, Western Union was founded here.  The first beauty salon was here, Kodak and Xerox and all kinds of things like that.  And we got one hundred and fifty extraordinary creative images that then several of which were printed in the paper.  And, you know, we're just seeing that this brings people much more deeply into the experience because they care about it because they're engaged in interacting with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you need things.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I was going to ask a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say for people who haven't played ARGs or alternate reality games before.  So you and a group, you teach at RIT and a group of students there are working with the local paper.  Tell me what the what the alternate reality is like.  I mean, what is it like for readers?  What's the game like and what's the timeline like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we made a decision when we started that we didn't want this to be a typical ARG in some ways.  We talked with a bunch of ARG developers.  And one of the things they warned us about is that in a lot of ARGs, what happens is that 80 percent of the content is designed for 20 percent of the players, the people who are really hardcore, solve every puzzle, dig up every clue, devote 30 hours a week to the game.  And we wanted this to be something that could have a casual user base and have the casual users be considered important as well.  So we essentially created two things.  First, there is a narrative behind it.  You know, ARGs generally have a storyline behind them where you're turning your day to day world into the game board for some kind of narrative storytelling going on.  So what we said is, you know, let's imagine that there was a secret society here in Rochester, one that's been here for several hundred years and that all of the important figures here, you know, the Susan B.  Anthony and Frederick Douglass and the founders of Western Union and Kodak and Xerox, all of them have been members over the years.  But lately, the society has been wracked by a lot of internal conflict.  And there are three factions fighting for control of the society.  They really want to revitalize the organization with younger people.  And so they're using this game as a way to identify new members for the society.  And so there's an underlying narrative that if you dig, you can find it.  There are Twitter feeds, there are blog posts, there are puzzles and things like that.  But for probably 80 percent of the users, what they're seeing is something really straightforward.  If you go to Picture the Impossible and sign up every week for seven weeks, we've got a different theme.  And the themes are all drawn from the history of Rochester, the important community aspects.  So week one, we did arts and crafts to coincide with the local arts festival.  Week two, we did local food and drink.  This week is imaging and optics because we've got Bausch and Loam here.  We've got pictometry here, Kodak, Xerox.  And so within each week for the theme, we have five different web based flash activities that people can do.  You know, map games, video quizzes that we do in partnership with the local TV station.  And so you can you can play those without ever leaving your computer.  We also have local games.  We do one individual challenge and one scavenger hunt every week that people can go out and explore the city and find the things we're pointing them to.  And then there's at least two newspaper puzzles every week, things that one in the Sunday paper and one somewhere else in the paper during the week.  So for many of our players, that's all they see.  They're really not that interested in the story and going down the rabbit hole.  But there is a rabbit hole there for the people that want to play with it.  And then part of the story in terms of the people being in factions is when you choose a faction, when you first log into the game, each faction is associated with a local charity.  Each week we add up all the points that our players achieve and the faction that has that has earned the most points in aggregate, their charity gets the largest donation from the money we got from a foundation.  So there's a reason for people to keep coming back to the site because every week their points count and not only to helping them get invitations to a party at the end, but also towards helping the charities.  And we're seeing some great stuff like people who have gone to the charities and asked for tours and done videos featuring them because they they really want a centering point for their faction to be involved with.  So a lot of this was about defining what we wanted people to accomplish in the game.  And we we did it.  We talked with Jane McGonigal and she said, people need to know what are the verbs you want to associate this.  And we said, well, we want them to give back.  We want them to learn and we want them to explore.  And so far, we've been amazingly successful on all three of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's exciting to me about this is Fred Wilson at AVC.com, the venture capitalist blogger, wrote a post today talking about the Golden Triangle.  Things that come in between mobile and live.  And I'm going to forget the third.  I'll remember in a second.  And I threw in local as well.  And I think there's something to the idea of stuff that comes in together and brings it together.  We talked about this on the show last week, the idea of the annotated world of tying together the Internet with the real world.  What's neat about this is that it's local and it's live and it keeps things going, which probably is a good segue to the idea of the idea of the internet.  Which probably is a good segue into the next topic for the week, which is Google's mobile strategy coming together.  Pardon me while I look off screen here to our wave, which we have a whole bunch of news here.  Let me just just just list it real quickly.  Android is finally coming to AT&T, says the rumor, which seems to be fairly solid, that the Dell phone using Android is going to come to AT&T.  And that means that Google now gets hegemony among the mobile operators.  Number two, Google and AT&T continue sniping over VoIP.  Google tries to argue this week that it's not really a phone company.  It's just a feature.  So it has the right to block certain calls.  AT&T, importantly, backed down on VoIP and now allows VoIP applications.  Next, Google has added rich advertising, rich ad sense to its mobile pages and mobile apps, which I think is really important.  Then we have, I think, some news on Cyanogen and so on.  So there's a lot going on with mobile application and Eric Schmidt's been talking about local and mobile.  Matt, fill us in a little bit about about where you think local and mobile go together with search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they go together really well if you think about it, because it's it's kind of nice that, you know, we have voice recognition going now.  And then we know where your mobile phone is.  And you can always correct that location if you want to.  So you can do a search.  And I've done this like last night where you're searching for El Rio or someplace in San Francisco.  And we will show you the closest El Rio, you know, because we think we know where you are.  And then we can also say, oh, here are some directions if you'd like to go there.  And one extra thing that I don't even know whether made the list was we just added search options on the mobile search.  So now you can say, OK, I'd like to show me results within the last 24 hours or something like that.  So it's the same functionality that you can do on desktop search, but it's now available on your mobile phone.  And I mean, if you think about all the different Android phones that are coming out, especially in the holiday sort of season,  there really is a lot of momentum for people to be able to hack their phone, install applications, do all sorts of weird, cool, neat new stuff.  So I'm looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you can write many Android things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I haven't been doing much Android development, but it is really exciting.  What's happening on Android is really exciting right now.  I mean, basically this holiday season, a CTIA, which is a wireless conference happened here in San Diego this week.  And there are a couple of announcements tomorrow.  The HTC Hero comes out on Sprint, which will be an Android phone.  Samsung is going to do the Moment phone on November 1st.  I mean, essentially, you're looking at Android Android phones.  You know, you're going to have lots of choice and handset and lots of different flavors of the operating system as well,  depending on the carrier and choice when it comes to carrier as well,  which is I think is what is the difference between the iPhone and Android right now is that you just have a lot more choices and you can customize.  And hey, you like the flip out keyboard? Great.  You can get you can get a handset.  I haven't played around with any of the new Android handsets yet, mostly because I'm too cheap to get a new handset before my contract is up.  But I am going to be playing with the new hero, I think tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want a new business right now.  You know, maybe it's our wish list, but I want to create a business where we can gang together and five of us can buy phone handsets and trade them back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And just try them out.  And yeah, exactly.  You know, I guess if I asked, I could get review units.  I just I hate taking review units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, so now the Federal Trade Commission will come after you and you don't admit to your sin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you dare write about exactly exactly the other kind of interesting Android thing that happened is a doughnut dropped last week.  I just got it on my G1 and a few doughnut is the new update to Android.  All the Android updates are named after pastries for a reason.  I'm not sure. So the previous one was was Cupcake and doughnut is one point six.  And I a few weeks ago on this show, I had featured the cyanogen custom Android ROM, which I had I had hacked my phone and installed this custom ROM.  And then there was a little tussle between Google and the developer, cyanogen.  Google said, hey, there are some closed source apps in this ROM that you redistributing and you can't do that.  The operating system is open source, but not the apps.  And so the great news this week and actually this happened last week, but now cyanogen, who is the developer, has actually released a version.  He's released a version of the ROM that does not include any of the closed source apps.  And that and he has he's also offering a utility that lets you back up the apps, which you have a license for because you purchased the phone.  And then reinstall them onto his ROM. So that'll be in the show notes.  So great news, cyanogen, really happy that he was able to work that out with Google.  Happy to see how that worked out. So so yeah, it will be interesting.  I mean, I'm happy to see that Sprint is, you know, taking on the Android platform and which is much more open and has just better apps.  And we'll let people walk around with their smartphones and participate in more community games like like the one like picture, the impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do we think about Dell doing a phone?  I have a little bit of a relationship with Dell going back to unhappier than happier times.  But it's about time for them to get into this, I think, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's certainly been some reports, but I don't know whether anything's been confirmed quite yet.  But but, you know, you get Android on Verizon.  It's going to be an exciting holiday season, I think, because there's a lot of a lot of stuff coming out.  And and so whichever carrier you prefer, I think you'll have a lot more options, which is which is something that's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If one of you were going to get a phone for me for, I don't know, Christmas, which Android phone do you think is the is the hot one to to lust after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would I would hold off a little while because, you know, it seems like the announcements are coming fast and furious for the time being.  And so if if you can sort of wait and see how the holiday season sort of shakes out, then you'll you'll probably have a little more ability to sort of, you know, take a look at different things.  The hero and my touch.  There's a lot of good ones right now.  But, you know, it seems like we're in a period where we're getting a lot of announcements really quickly.  And so if you sort of give it just a little bit of time, I suspect, you know, you'll have all sorts of different options and then you'd hate to have one.  And then and then, you know, a new one comes out three days later or something like that.  So there's a lot of good ones.  The hero, for example, looks very good as far as the ones that I've heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, I think I'm a big fan of being a late early adopter when it comes to gadgets.  I always kind of wait to see what people say when they have it.  I do with the iPhone, too.  It's like, let's just wait to see what comes out and what people think of it and then make a decision.  Although you can play the waiting game forever because there's always going to be something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that on TechCrunch just before we came on the air, somebody there was a picture of a guy who put his palm tree in his glass of beer, which I think was a review of it.  Liz, did you find the paper is understanding mobile and understanding the idea of trying to deal with people in and out two ways with their mobile devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To an extent, you know, the person we've been working with at the paper is now the managing editor.  But when we started with her, she was the head of multimedia and innovation for the paper.  And she really gets it.  And she's been hiring a lot of really good people in the development side.  And actually, the Rochester Gannett paper has a fabulous mobile site in terms of getting information out for the going back in.  We you know, they don't quite have that in place.  So we've been using a platform called Scavenger from a company in Boston that we've been really delighted with for the mobile scavenger hunts.  But I think they see the value of it.  And it's more simply a resource allocation issue is having enough people in this current newspaper economy to be able to build the kinds of tools they'd like to for mobile interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Liz, I know I'm sorry, Jeff, I keep cutting you off.  It's the problem of having Leo in the driver's seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't see each other in video this time because there's no view of Uncle Leo.  Right, exactly.  I apologize.  I'm in a hurry.  Go ahead, Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just was going to say, you know, this show is called This Week in Google, but it's really about cloud computing.  And even though Matt works for Google and we talk about Google a lot, it's about the cloud in general.  And Liz, I wanted to ask you.  I know that Bing was a big sponsor, a picture of the impossible.  So I wanted to ask you, were there any tie ins with Bing or was it, you know, how did that sponsorship work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was definitely a tie in.  We're using Bing Maps a lot on the site.  We're using Bing Maps for all of the local games.  So, for example, we'll do a bird's eye local image of the starting point for the scavenger hunt, which has been great.  And for us, that was actually a really nice local tie in because while Redmond isn't local, their bird's eye images all come from Pictometry.  And Pictometry is a Rochester based company.  So that for us, we've tried to, you know, to sort of eat our own dog food as much as possible to be as local as possible in all of our content.  All of our video content comes from a local TV station.  All of our images come from the Democrat and Chronicle photographers.  And so having Pictometry from the Bing Maps was great.  If we'd had, you know, I should say that we did this on a budget of nothing with no staff assigned to it.  So we have begged, borrowed and stolen everything that we needed to make this happen along the way.  So there are a lot of things we would have done differently or more of if we had had resources to work with.  So there are other ways we would have loved to have involved things like better local search,  better integration of news and video and things like that.  We've learned an enormous amount doing this and moving forward, we'll do some other stuff.  But for now, the major Bing integration for us has been the maps.  And, you know, I have to give them major props, A, for giving us some money to help keep the lights on and B, for saying, sure, of course, you can go on this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's that's really cool. Very, very cool.  I'm happy to hear that that they helped help you out because it's a great project.  Are you going to open source the plans for the game so that other newspapers can do the same?  I think Ted, we talked about that at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We we had talked about that because we built this quickly and without resources.  This is the version one of the underlying platform.  And I don't want to open source it because I don't really think anybody else wants to work with it in the form that it's currently in.  It's a it's one of these duct tape and string constructions where it's doing what it needs to do for right now.  But I learned so much that, in fact, my next round of this is going to be to look for funding, either grant funding or business funding to to build the robust platform, the scalable platform that we could give to other people.  And absolutely, we want to make it available.  I mean, if it's only us that does it, that's not fun.  We want everybody to do it.  And I know Gannett has been looking at it as something that they could use in other markets as well.  So once we can get a good version of it together, a solid version, the plan is absolutely to put it out there so that other people can work with it.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's exciting about this is that you have a newspaper company that's trying to increase engagement, do new things.  This week in the Great Hall, the people in Tiananmen Square in China, you had the head of the Associated Press, Tom Curley and Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp,  both continuing this rant and rail against Google aggregators, bloggers, calling them thieves, not understanding the link economy,  not understanding the idea that the audience is the distributor of what they do.  And if they put themselves behind, I don't know, a great wall, that they're going to just cut themselves off from the world.  And so when you see these experiments like what you're doing, Liz, going on with that paper in Rochester, it's the exact opposite.  We've got to figure out how to spread the word that we need to build new relationships in new ways with the public.  Nokia, by the way, absolutely.  We're working with Nokia at the City University of New York, where I teach on an assignment tool so that if you're at work with Nokia at first,  but it'll work eventually with everything where you can assign people in the field who happen to be near news events to take that picture or bring in that video or do other things.  And when the information comes in, metadata is attached.  What assignment it is, what story it is, plus the obvious things the phone knows, where it was taken by, whom, when.  And you start to get to a new idea of how we gather and share news using these mobile devices if we think mobilely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think for us, you know, it was interesting.  The whole culture clash between academia and, you know, a commercial news organization was a challenge in and of itself.  But one of the things I hadn't realized till we started working closely with the paper is how much of a firewall there is and understandably between the business side of the paper and the news side of the paper.  And for us, what happened was the news side totally got it.  You know, the VPN news was a huge supporter of this.  The managing editor was, you know, the main push for it there.  But the business people didn't quite get what we were doing.  Didn't really understand the way to monetize it.  Right.  So this has been a frustration for us because the news people aren't allowed to go out and ask for money because that taints the process.  But the business people didn't understand it well enough to really work with us on it.  And what we really want to do after this is done, I mean, our role on the academic side is then to say, how do we make this understandable for the business people?  How do we write this up in a way that they can make sense of it, that it's not just a bunch of words and buzzwords, but that it's actually a plan for how can you make this a part of your business plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt and Gina, do you play four square, either of you?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's similar, isn't it?  I don't play it either.  And I feel like I'm left out of some game that's going on in Rochester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Four Square seems like this great business in terms of, you know, it's wonderful, especially for single people.  You know, like they joke about Facebook often started out kind of as a way for people to meet each other.  And, you know, if you base your product on women wanting to meet men and men wanting to meet women, that's not an awful business model.  But, you know, I'm married, so four square doesn't hold quite as much appeal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to broadcast my location and I'm just like, well, that just proves I'm getting old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're getting lots of families and couples playing the game.  You know, the newspaper said we want to target young professionals.  But what we're really getting is, you know, we have, you know, over 2000 registered authenticated users, but many of those represent groups of two, three or four people where whole families are playing together.  And I think that's one of the things that's, you know, important in areas that aren't New York City or San Francisco or Seattle.  And that's the thing with four square is you have to live in a big city.  If I try to log into four square here in Rochester, it says it looks like you're closer to New York than anyplace else.  So we'll check you in in New York City, which doesn't really help me all that much.  So targeting the families and the couples here has been really, really exciting for us that we're getting multi-generational use of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing that I think could sell to the business guys at the paper is Google this week.  Maybe, Matt, you can explain this better than I can added more rich and functionality to add sense on mobile devices.  Eric Schmidt has said in the past that Google will end up making more money on mobile than it makes on the Web.  It makes more money than God on the Web.  So mobile has a huge priority.  Matt, do you know anything about where this is headed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I just know that there's a lot of different functionality for mobile.  If you think about it, it's not it.  Things are still in flux.  So there's there's applications.  There's you know, there's potentially flash.  There's you know, things like banner ads.  And I think until things are more settled, you want to support as much functionality as possible.  So different formats of ads, different sizes of ads, different ways for people to sort of fetch and get metrics and analytics on their ads, all those sorts of things.  So I think, as I recall, this most recent launch sort of basically increases the number of options that people have.  So if you're writing an application or if you're working on a on a mobile device as a developer, you can sort of offer a wider or a different variety of potential ad choices.  And eventually, you know, the world will sort of settle on what we think as the standard way that people expect to get mobile ads.  But until that happens, I think it makes sense to be as open as possible and explore that space quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Out of left field, Matt, questions here, since you're the chief cop of spam, does mobile have an advantage in the spam world because identity is set or does it have the same perils as anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's really funny because when people ask me about mobile spam, mostly they're worried about what if I show different content to mobile phones than to desktops, which is natural.  And it's perfectly fine. But yeah, when there is identity, when there is location, it's harder to fake things.  You know, you can't pretend to be in Seattle when you're really in Bulgaria or China or something like that.  So there's also the fact that there's usually a billing relationship. You know, someone has to pay for that phone.  So they're a little bit harder to fake. So even if you go and sign up for Gmail, for example, oftentimes we will offer the option to SMS a PIN code.  And then that just sort of says, you know what? It's hard to get a lot of different phone numbers.  It's hard to get the ability to use a lot of different phone numbers.  So a lot of sites, not only Google, I think probably Craigslist and other sites also sort of have looked at using phone numbers or mobile cell phones as a way to sort of cut down on some of that spam.  And it can work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed, I remember Leo confessed a few weeks ago that he needed phone numbers.  Do I think if I remember, get Gmail addresses to be able to get various wave invitations, right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he said he needed he needed separate phone numbers for different voice accounts, which makes sense.  You know, just this week I signed up for Google App Engine, which is a developer tool.  And in order to do so, I had to give it my cell phone number and it SMS me a verification code.  And, you know, because they're really they're doling out, you know, CPU bandwidth database, you know, disk space.  So I guess they kind of have to verify, you know, one App Engine account for, you know, per developer.  So, yeah, that's that's pretty interesting.  But the thing is, I kind of want to be able to fake my location if I want to.  Like, I want to be able to say maybe not that I'm in San Francisco, if I'm in Bulgaria.  But I like the idea of being able to say I'm in the San Diego area versus, you know, I'm on this this the corner of the street in this street just for, you know, for obvious privacy reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. And in fact, if you go to Google Latitude, we have the ability to not only say don't just pinpoint me to within a, you know, a tiny little area, but say I'm at this.  I'm at this city, for example.  And you have the ability to go to a web page and say, you know, I might be in San Diego, but I can say that I'm in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is really quite helpful.  So there's granularity, not just in who you choose to share information with, but also there's granularity in whether you show information and where you say you are and at what level of information.  Which I think is very healthy.  And I think the latitude folks have really thought about how to how to make that a useful functionality so that people don't feel those sorts of concerns.  At the same time, the ability to do SMS can be kind of helpful just to know you're sort of talking to a real person.  So, for example, Google's local business center used to send postcards and sometimes still can.  But you can also get an SMS or, you know, get a phone call that says your PIN is and now you go to a web page and you type in this number.  And that's just really helpful because the spammers find it harder to get a lot of different phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting too, Matt, is the back to this notion of the annotated world.  Gina, I think if I could not only decide when to say how accurate my location is, but also when to associate it with data.  If it's some thought of mine, I don't want geo associated with it.  But if I'm going to review a restaurant, I want geo associated with it.  If I'm going to send in a news story to Liz's colleague newspaper, they're going to require me to say where I am to kind of prove that I'm there and that the picture is legit.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then it becomes a question is like, you know, how accurate then is that data?  You know what I mean? If it's easy to to fuzz it, you know, can a newspaper really use that as an eyewitness account?  Can a reporter use that as an eyewitness account?  If it's just got a couple of longitude and latitude coordinates attached to it, that it wouldn't be that easy to change, you know, that difficult to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You also turn on the verified geo when you feel you need it and just turn it off and say what you want to say.  And if people can see which is which, you know, that seems to solve some problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This ties into the discussion, I think, two weeks ago about Twitter and geo.  This week, we also had discussion that Twitter is talking to both Google and I think Bing.  Right. About say the rumors about about Turing over the database.  And what does this do to the potential of live search, whether it's Google or Bing?  I don't care. But but since Twitter is right now that is that putting Twitter in the cloud is that kind of making Twitter irrelevant in this?  What would that mean if it happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I can't speak to what deals, you know, Twitter might be going on.  Not not that I would even know them as one thing, but it is sort of interesting that, you know, Google and Bing both crawl Twitter.  So, you know, I don't know what percentage of Twitter we're able to crawl, but we are able to crawl a fairly large amount.  And to the extent that you expect anybody that's important would get retweeted.  And so you'll sort of see that information.  I think that there's definitely that it's definitely the case that we can already crawl a pretty interesting fraction enough to sort of do some some fun real time stuff.  But, you know, whenever you go to Twitter and you type something in that goes into Twitter's database.  And so, you know, if even if you have a feed, you can't change that feed page.  You can't point it to a hub or pubs, a pub hub or anything like that, at least not by default or any way that I know.  So it's in Twitter's databases. It's in Twitter's silo.  And so it would be up to them about how to release that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. What do you think the impact is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so OK, so let's think about live Twitter search results and Google results.  Well, first you have geo data when they turn on when they turn on geo, right?  So regular red pages don't generally have geo data, but Twitter search results do.  And so a situation, this is a good this is a situation I was used or an example I was used with Twitter search results.  I'm on the West Coast. So American Idol or different reality shows air three hours earlier on the East Coast.  So if I search for American Idol winner, you know, at 6 p.m. my time when I know it's out on the East Coast in regular Google search results.  And Matt, you can correct me if I'm wrong. You generally can't find the winner before it's aired.  But if Twitter search results are integrated there, I'll know the winner before before it airs.  So you just get that, you know, that instant answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's historically Google likes to do algorithmic stuff.  We don't tend to do a one box that says, OK, here's here's who won American Idol or who's who is winning the Emmys, that sort of thing.  Although this week we did do a poison control.  So it turns out there's one single one hundred number that works for all of the United States.  So if anybody types in poison control, they'll get a little one box.  So we don't do this very often. But, for example, earlier today, I Twittered that I was going to be on Twig later today and just doing a search for Matt cuts this week in Google.  I see it one, two, three, four result number five. I see, you know, my snippet.  I'm going to be on this week in Google later today.  So we've already crawled my page on Twitter and seen that.  So we're relatively good at finding fresh stuff pretty quickly.  Certainly Twitter has got it first.  But yeah, I think Google's pretty good at search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. In general, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think you're right, Gina. Google's always been weak at live.  It needs content to ferment, as I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's metadata to like Matt, you know, Matt, I assume that there are Twitter accounts that like echo your tweets or maybe even modify them.  Like if you had a verified account, I mean, there's certain metadata that Twitter has in their database that that could be available to Google.  I mean, I suppose that they could embed it in the page in a certain way that Google's you know, that the Google bot would get anyway, because, you know, the Google bot's pretty good, as we said.  But it seems like it might be, I don't know, you know, you'd have identity geo information and it could it might show up a little bit faster.  I don't know. I'd be interested to know. I mean, what do you what is the lag time between something a tweet gets published on Twitter?  You have a pretty popular Twitter account and it shows up on Google about about how long do you think that takes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't think it takes very long.  Certainly if Twitter has the fire hose, they have the full database.  And so, you know, any information that any random person tweets, they have it very, very quickly because they get it directly.  But there was a really good interview that came out in Business Week this week with Amit Singhal, who's my office mate.  He's the head of Google's core ranking.  And he talked for about two or three paragraphs about our philosophy of real time, of live, whatever you want to call it.  And what he basically said is that Twitter is a very large chunk of what gets produced in terms of real time information.  But suppose there's an embargo, you know, and at nine p.m., something goes live and the embargo is lifted.  If somebody's worked really hard to write a good blog post and at nine oh one, they hit the submit button.  In our opinion, that's basically real time as well.  So our philosophy on ranking tends to be more or less a window to sort of say, OK, show me very recent results.  So, for example, if you do a search, you can click the show options link and and then we'll show you the ability to see things with recent results, essentially.  So you can search past 24 hours or even the past hour.  So historically, Twitter absolutely is where a lot of real time content gets created.  But it's not the only place, you know, a good blog post can be considered real time in our opinion.  And so we sort of provide those options in our philosophies more along the lines of rank anything useful on the Web that looks pretty reputable within a very short time window.  And that can be considered real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both of you seen Tinker dot com. Tinker was started by Glam.  Glam is the largest women's brand network online.  It kind of I think blew up the model of media online by creating networks instead of owning content, which is a model for news.  But that's subject of another day.  They got all fascinated with the idea of the live Web and what was going on here.  So they started Tinker dot com, which categorizes Twitter news feeds now associates it with Reuters news.  And there I had dinner with Samir Arora, the CEO of Glam this week.  And they're finding, of course, no surprise that the news is coming much faster from Twitter than from other sources, including Google News.  So that now they're exchanging feeds with Reuters because Reuters wants the heads up to news that Twitter provides.  And Tinker wants the context that Reuters provides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I think the embargo example that that Mac gave is a really good one, right?  Because that blog post is written and at nine p.m. the publish button gets pressed.  But for the most part, the things that happen, things that don't have that kind of planning or lead time, Twitter, you know,  Twitter news is going to be out there faster just because it takes a lot less time to write 140 characters. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Twitter is fantastic. I mean, one thing that's wonderful is how Twitter lowered the barrier so that regular people are creating and making content.  So, you know, if a bear goes crazy at the zoo or if a guy in downtown Palo Alto is walking around with a gun, which, you know, I've seen both those examples,  you'll have one out of 20 or whatever the fraction is of the people will have a Twitter account.  And so absolutely a ton of content does get created there.  And Twitter is fantastic to find out, especially about a breaking event or when something just happened.  I think where where it can get a little bit more muddy is 10 hours after that tsunami or 10 hours after that breaking event.  And then when you search, if you're only sorting by date, then you'll tend to get, you know, whatever one random person happened to say about that.  Whereas you might want to get useful links and OK, what are the resources that are the biggest source of reputable information and stuff like that?  That's where it's definitely a tradeoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When GEO comes in, you're going to have some sense of what's happening if it's legit.  And then it becomes a matter of people talking about it rather than telling about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Take the example of Obama, though. That doesn't have as much of a GEO focus.  So, you know, I heard about Obama getting the Nobel Prize on Twitter because I happened to be surfing there first.  And so finding out a breaking piece of information is fantastic.  But then a day later, you'll probably if you search for Obama Nobel Prize, you'll get more or less random samplings of what people are saying.  So it's always this tradeoff of real time versus perspective, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a gathering mechanism for gathering news from witnesses.  It's a distribution mechanism for sharing that news.  And then it's a discussion mechanism. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, that news got pushed to you. Right.  I mean, you happen to be on Twitter and that news got pushed to you.  You aren't you didn't know to search for it.  Right. One question about integrating Twitter, you know, Twitter search results in Bing or Google.  I mean, would would would, for example, probably I'm not sure this is a question you can answer, but will Google use Twitter metadata like the number of followers you have or whether or not you're a verified account or how many tweets you have?  Would you use that to rank results to mean with somebody with a verified account and 50,000 followers and very few follow ease or friends with that person?  Would that person get a higher ranking and results, you know, theoretically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now we don't.  So what we find is the people that have a lot of followers tend to attract a lot of links anyway.  And the important Twitter posts or micro tweets, whatever you want, you know, whatever you want to call the micro blogging items, those tend to go ahead and attract links.  So you could certainly look at a lot of different factors and Twitter would have a lot of it judging, you know, anything from when someone joined Twitter to how many replies they get to how many followers they have.  So you could probably build a pretty good source of reputation for an individual Twitter user.  And even if you're not Twitter, you could probably do a relatively good job of that.  I'm sure that some of the real time search engines try to do that with Google.  Google, just going purely by PageRank gets us about 90, 95 percent of the way there.  So we don't do anything special or different in ranking Twitter pages or Facebook pages or any social media like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because when you reply to someone on Twitter, the metadata is says in reply to this tweet and it's a link back to that individual tweet.  So that would contribute to PageRank.  So PageRank scales is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  PageRank scales.  And the nice thing is it's not just replies or links within Twitter.  It's also a lot of people will link to tweets or, you know, friend feed will link to a specific tweet.  And so just from crawling the web, you can find a lot of good information that way.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speak before we get off Twitter.  It was the oddest that we had to, by the way, I don't think we had a Google downtime this week.  We had Twitter half down.  I don't know if you experienced this in your time zone, but I found that it was only I was only seeing my own tweets.  I thought it was a new killer app that I could talk to myself.  Who needs the world?  Have you heard any story about what this down was?  Because it was so strange.  It was it was only parts of it were down.  I could see replies to me, but I couldn't see my feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the status blog, the Twitter status blog said that an edge case with a particular service that Twitter uses had had happened and something had gone down.  And yeah, that's what happened to me.  My timeline was just stale.  I saw my own tweets, but no one else's.  I saw replies.  It was weird.  It was like everybody left the room.  It was like everybody left the party, but it wasn't down.  It's something I said.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that was definitely interesting.  Interesting down edge.  I'd rather just have the fail well straight up, you know, then then then that happened again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt, you talked about that Businessweek article before about about Google and search.  And I know you tweeted it this week and there were a lot of really interesting things in that about how Google tests.  Can you talk about that for a few minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, absolutely.  So there was an interview with Scott Huffman, who's the head of our evaluation team.  And and Rob Hoff, who wrote the article, did a very good job of drilling down and saying, give more examples, give more examples.  So we basically talked about how we evaluate search quality.  So, for example, one one sort of secret that I gave was that I always keep a notebook in my back pocket.  So if I'm at a local arts fair, I'm collecting the names of these little tiny mom and pop artists, the ones who have AOL email addresses who are not necessarily all that.  And so if you search for their name and photography or whatever, you want to return their website.  So they don't even know it.  But we're trying to check our quality by looking at whether we return these little tiny mom and pop businesses that maybe only have one or two links or don't even have any links.  And then Scott talked a little bit about, you know, we'll do A B testing.  So we'll sort of show you one set of results most of the time.  But a very small percentage of users will get an experiment.  And if the click through is radically better on on this experimental group or radically worse, then that tells us something as well.  So we have a whole bunch of different experiments that we run as well as different query sets.  And so if you expect a certain result to show up and it doesn't show up, somebody usually finds out about that and starts immediately debugging and figures out, OK, is the site down or was it something on our side?  And we find a lot of bugs before anybody even notices that there are bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, one thing that surprised me was the human impact of this.  I think it surprised Rob as well that you have a lot of human testers doing these these quality control checks around the world for a not bad hourly rate, by the way.  How does that work? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The idea is whenever we have a new change, we'd like to know whether it's an improvement or not.  And so in order to do that, we'll actually create a production system that can rank the rank the results differently.  And then we basically show the two results side by side and we say, OK, you as an expert rater, you know, you're in Japan, you actually live in Japan.  You know what should be the result for this hospital or for this particular query, which set of results is better.  And it's blind. So they don't know what they're evaluating.  They don't know which side is which. They don't know anything about it.  All they know is, OK, I think left side is better, right side is better, whatever.  And so by having those sorts of ratings, those sort of side by side ratings in really dozens of different languages, we're able to spot problems.  So, you know, you don't just roll out a change because it works well in English because it might break something in Chinese or Spanish or French or Italian or German.  So there's a ton of different raters who help us out just by sort of evaluating the results side by side and saying, I think this is better or I think that this is worse.  We tend to do things in small incremental changes.  So if you look at Bing, they tend to launch on more like every six months sort of schedule.  We tend to launch more on the order of, you know, six to eight to ten things per week.  So we have a meeting every week, every Thursday, where we sort of talk about all the proposed changes and either approve them or table them or send them back to, you know, get more details or to tweak the algorithm a little bit better.  So in the same way you could think of a car as a machine, you know, there is one algorithm that sort of ranks all of Google search results, but a car is composed of a bunch of different parts.  And those parts are also algorithms.  So we we do try to make these changes very incrementally.  And most of the time, people don't even notice, which is a little bit discouraging.  You know, you you make some huge improvement in how you do Chinese or Italian.  And sure, people like the results better, but they don't really it's not such a huge difference that they notice.  And so what we do is we've just started to blog a little bit more about sort of even just the UI changes that we've done in the last week or two.  We've realized that unless we talk about some of these changes, some of which are subtle, even if they're involving the user interface, people won't always notice them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How often do you have to roll back a change because you have an oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty rare.  And in fact, it's very rare.  What's more likely is you have a binary that goes out that has some problem with performance or, you know, maybe you found a way that one query could crash that binary.  So we do a bunch of stuff to avoid having the problems of downtime or brownouts or going to Google and nothing shows up.  Those tend to be the sorts of things that you send out a test binary and you find out there's a problem and you have to revert that.  As far as search quality changes, we do a bunch of a bunch of evaluation before things launch to make sure that it's safe.  We do occasionally roll back, but it's it's really not that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of our traditions here on Twig is to not talk about Google Books because we don't have Siva Vatnatyan here.  I tried to get Siva Vatnatyan this week. We didn't.  But I think we have to at least hit the topic a little bit.  By the way, my son Jake says the Google Book search discussion is boring.  Never talk about it.  But this week we did have Sergey Brin's op ed in the New York Times defending Google Books search.  And I think, Matt, it was you who sent me a tweet saying you had a reason to know why he really wrote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it just the fact that he made this joke, you know, that something limited consumer choice, like consumer choice in unicorns is limited, which is just a very Sergey thing to say.  He was essentially making the point that in the same way that unicorns don't really exist, there really wasn't any choice before you had the ability to get access to these books using Google Book Search, because unless you happen to live right next to a major research library, there was no way you're going to be able to get to see that book.  So that was most of the op ed was very well reasoned and very polite.  And he quoted a few historical books, which was fun.  But you could see a little bit of Sergey come through in that sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That unicorn line was my favorite for sure.  Sorry, that unicorn line got me.  I have to say that op ed convinced me I thought it was pretty even handed and well written and well reasoned.  Actually, Liz, I'm interested to know what you think about the Google Books situation, if you've been keeping up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So you're going to put me on the spot here because I'm the librarian and I've been so busy building and running a game for the past three months that I can't do anything else.  So I know you're the librarian.  This is where I'm asking.  I know you're the librarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I won't put you on the spot because I know you've been running the game.  But I know that you're coming from you're coming from Microsoft and you know, the whole Google digitizing all the books in the world.  I'm curious to know what the librarian thinks of that.  But I won't I won't put you on the spot if you're not.  I mean, I can respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't respond to anything new that's going on right now.  But, you know, I can give my my general sense, which is that it makes me really, really nervous to have all that content centralized and and owned by a single entity.  And, you know, one of the things I love about libraries is their their deeply decentralized approach to content.  And it's so so the librarian and me worries a lot about all of the content being controlled in one central source instead of by consortiums or collaborative groups that have competing stakes and therefore some incentive to address each other's needs.  So so there's a low level discomfort for me of commercially owned books.  We still have to get Siva on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you, Gina and Matt.  I like the op-ed.  I said so on Twitter.  And then Siva came in.  I can't find it right now.  But he went on to my Facebook page where the tweet had gone and had a little rant about it.  So we will get him on.  Another tradition here at This Week in Google is that we have to talk about WAVE.  So Gina's suggestion, let's inaugurate a new feature called This Week in WAVE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, Jeff, I know you and Matt are on WAVE.  Liz, have you gotten into the WAVE preview?  Are you using WAVE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I received my first invitation into WAVE on Friday and I have not yet accepted it.  I tried to accept it from my phone and it said you absolutely may not do this on your phone.  Go home and use your computer.  You don't want to do it on your phone.  So I actually, as you started talking, I said, oh, I should pull up that invitation and log in.  But I'll be honest with you, I have no idea from anything that I've read why I want to be in it.  So if you could enlighten me as to why this would be useful to me, that'd be lovely.  There's actually a fantastic website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's it called?  It's easier to understand than WAVE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's easier to understand than Sarah Palin.  What is the actual URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going down right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in our feed.  Oh, where the hell is it?  Damn, hold on one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, it is a website that basically compares Google WAVE against a whole host of inexplicable things like Sarah Palin, like women was in there.  I don't know really.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a tech crunch.  230 people, 49% said Google WAVE was easier to understand than Sarah Palin, which was 51%.  Google WAVE is easier to understand than Obama's Nobel Peace Prize, than the United States tax code, than Scientology, than women.  That was it for the discussion.  Google WAVE is hard, Liz, but I think that I wrote a post I'll send to you, also the LA Times had a good feature, about how Google WAVE can have a real impact on news.  It's collaborative, it's real time, a closed group can collaborate on it, and soon they'll be able to publish to the web.  So I think you can blow the brains of your friends down there at the Rochester Democrat with an idea of a new way.  When you turn them to what they should go next is two-way news and collaborating between journalists and witnesses, WAVE is going to be an incredible tool, we think.

Transcript:  I see a couple of people from our newspaper, I just logged into it, and in my contact list I see a couple of people from our local newspaper already in there and playing with it.  I will say that as someone who has had to, because it makes me so depressed, stop reading any comment posted to a newspaper article,  I am hopeful that something that's perhaps tied to a more permanent identity than what most newspaper comments offer could perhaps improve the quality of discourse,  because after the election I just said that's it, I can never again read another comment on a newspaper article because they're just awful.  The quality of discourse is pathetic on most comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Liz, you're right, but the problem is I think that that is still kind of a centralized view of news that says, okay, here's what we've done, now enough about you, comment on what we've done.  That's all you allow is interactivity, whereas if we really truly turn to collaboration, if we have projects and journalism that we do together with the community and try to accomplish something Wikipedia-like,  that's a whole different kind of respect for the community and a different kind of collaboration, and I think that's the next wave of interaction.  Gina, have you done anything new with WAVE since we last talked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, last week we were talking about how difficult or easy it is to extend WAVE, and this week I actually dove into the API and made my first WAVE bot.  So there are two ways to extend WAVE, bots and gadgets, and yes, WAVE is complex and many things are, or not many things are easy to understand than that,  and the website is actually easier to understand than WAVE.com.  It's basically a hot or not for how confusing WAVE can be, which I found thoroughly amusing.  But I made my first bot this week and there's a Java API and a Python API.  It was super simple. It was an afternoon's worth of work.  It doesn't do anything very useful. I haven't done anything very complex with it yet, but yeah, I'm kind of hopped up.  I'm jazzed up about WAVE right now because I did a little bit of development and a few of my friends are in, and actually Jeff and I used WAVE before the show  because we were both very nervous about Leo not being here, so we were frantically waving together like, oh, what are we going to talk about?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just two of us. It worked pretty well, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did work very quite well, and it was really fun to watch your cursor dancing around, you know, 20 minutes before the show and to add to different sections.  I thought it worked actually quite well, and I've got a couple of real documents and outlines that I'm working on with coworkers now in WAVE  because I have the privilege of working with nerds that actually got into the preview, and I'm liking it.  I'm liking it very much. I mean, I think it is still very complex and difficult to understand, but I'm into it.  And Matt, since you're at Google, I wanted to ask you this question, which is basically the same question I asked you about Android a few shows ago.  Internally at Google, how much is WAVE in use? Does every employee have an invite? Are people ditching Gmail for it?  How do you see it happening inside the castle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely one of the best things about Google that I just can't get enough of is the ability to dog food stuff before anybody else.  So if you're interested in that at Google, you can usually get access to fun stuff, you know, things like WAVE.  So there's a lot of people, especially in the early days of WAVE, they said you can convert a whole team if you guys are all kind of willing to tackle it together.  And what I love is it's especially good for collaboration.  So if you're working on a document or there's something where you're both going to be polishing it out, then it's fantastic.  And so there's a lot of people that have been using it for that.  Yeah, I sort of feel like I need to mount a spirited defense of WAVE when everybody says it's all this super complex sort of stuff, because the announcement video was about an hour.  But it was because they wanted to take you through all the features.  And I sort of feel like, OK, multiple people connect up to one server, they can chat in real time, and they're, you know, has the ability in the server to sort of watch stuff go over the wire and add and augment and make things better.  And there's more structure. So it's not just raw text. You can add images, you can, you know, all that stuff is saved.  I feel like there is an essence of WAVE, which some people have seen because they have friends.  Like when you can collaborate, you can really start to see the potential.  And when you can write a bot, you can really start to see part of the power.  So I think a few people are sort of judging by the current user interface, which is not really the most fair.  You know, that's that's a good start.  But I think the power is in sort of the idea and in the direction that they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agreed. I'm sold. You don't have to defend WAVE to me. I'm sold.  I feel a little bit like everybody in my kind of productivity circles are like, oh, this is just another distracting thing.  And I'm like, but it's so cool. And, you know, it's going to take some time, I think, to get the elevator pitch right and to get and for people to I mean, it's only as good as, you know, who else is in it with you and who will collaborate with you.  And I think as people actually start to use it for things other than saying, hi, I'm waving.  This is me waving. How do you use this? You know, the utility reveals itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very RSS like in that way that people still don't know what it stands for.  And it doesn't matter what it stands for. You see it in all kinds of useful things. And it really works.  And Liz, as a journalism teacher, I'm dying for someone to start developing news applications with this.  So get finished with the darn game and let's talk.  Because I think that you and your team, because it is collaborative, it is social.  It's it's about creating new things. It's about taking the newspaper to the next step.  We can make beautiful music together here, Liz.  All right. Call me.  All right. So we're going to keep going in a moment with our other traditions of twig.  But first, we have a word from Leo, who has a word from our sponsor.  So let's see if Eric's ready to play that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks, guys. More twig in a bit.  But first, I have to tell you I want to tell you about go to assist, go to assist express.  I've been using we use go to assist the earlier version of go to assist way back when.  I think on the screensavers to help people.  But really, it has been redesigned.  It is a very great product for people who are in customer support or I.T.  If you're you know, there's nothing worse.  Believe me, I know better than anyone and trying to support people over the phone with go to assist express.  There's another way, a better way.  It's online tech support for your customers or clients over the Internet.  You view and control another person's computer online.  Of course, it's from Citrix.  They know how to do this kind of remote access, but this is designed specifically for I.T. pros.  You can fix a technical problem quickly and remotely without being there.  You can access files on the remote computer, transfer files from your computer to theirs to fix the problem.  Run up to eight unattended sessions at the same time or attended.  But the beauty of the eight sessions is you started install, you start to fix a scan, moved to the next machine, moved to the next machine.  You're never waiting for something to finish and your customers know it's unattended.  They do not have to be there.  You do have full chat and so forth so you can talk to them while you're working with their machine, but they don't have to be there.  Get a complete assay of the software on the system and on and on and on.  All sorts of great features built in for you from go to assist.  I want you to try it now.  Go to go to assist.com slash twig and try it absolutely free for 30 days.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  Try it free for 30 days.  You'll see you'll be a support hero.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Now back to Jeff and Gina and the gang.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We miss you.  But you're probably having a great time eating kebabs in Dubai for Ted X.  All right.  We're going to go down to our final traditions now, which is the tip of the week, the number of the week.  And Gina suggests we bring back the wish list.  So Gina, why don't you start with your tip over the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My tip of the week is actually a feature that came out a few weeks ago, but I think we were too preoccupied with with wave during the show to mention it.  The new version of Picasso Picasso three point five has facial recognition built in an eye photo has had this for a while.  I've never been a big eye photo fan, but but but I was really excited to see it come out in Picasso.  Download the upgraded to Picasso three five.  It scans gigabytes and gigabytes of photos that I have since 1998.  And it does a creepily good job of identifying faces and grouping your pictures by face.  For me, it did better on adults than children.  Like I have pictures of my nephews.  And when they're babies, they all kind of look similar.  So you can correct what faces it attach, you know, it identifies and and categorizes as a person.  But it makes suggestions.  You can confirm them.  It's a really, really cool and it's also an excellent way to see how bad and how good your hair has been over the years because you get to see lots of different hairstyles all grouped together in a grid.  So because of facial recognition and this is really a cloud tip, but it kind of is because Picasso hooks into Picasso Web Albums, which is, you know, well, Picasso's online hosted albums.  Now, I confess I prefer Flickr over Picasso Web Albums, but Picasso Web Albums also has facial recognition.  There are some limits on how much you can upload to Picasso Web Albums for free, but you can also do facial recognition there and tag faces with people from your from your contacts.  So it's a really cool feature.  And I encourage you if you're a Picasso user to turn it on because you'll you'll you'll unearth pictures of people over time.  It's really it's really neat to see people change over time and try out different hairstyles.  That's my tip of the week.  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's beautiful.  And we want to see your makeup styles over the period of twig and your bike and your bike movements and find me in that.  Wasn't there also an announcement this week that Google was creating kind of an internal cloud that lets you integrate Picasso and Docs and other things?  I only have that in the back of my brain.  Matt, do you know more about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a post on I think Google Operating System and then a follow up blog post that sort of hints at the ability to upload and share lots of different data and different data types.  And if you look at, for example, sites.google.com, they've really added the ability to add more and more things to that page, you know, Picasso albums and stuff like that.  So I think Google Operating System spotted it first.  And so we went ahead and blogged about it.  But there's just more ability to sort of upload stuff and and store it.  So I think that's the trend on Google sites.  I think that one is Google Sites.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So I'm going to give you advanced warning, Liz.  We're going to go for the wish list in a minute.  So think of something you want.  But first, we'll do the number of the week.  And my number of the week is one billion squared.  We had Google say this week that YouTube far surpasses the serving that that various measurement services had guessed and says that they're serving one billion videos a day.  It's like one billion McDonald's hamburgers every day, which is incredible.  We also have Eric Schmidt in a deposition saying that he knows, yes, he overpaid for YouTube by about a billion dollars.  Same number.  But said it was worth it and necessary so that he could grab it away from the competitors.  And I think that's coming true.  So there's my number of the week.  Now on to wish lists.  Matt, you lead us off here.  What's something you wish for in our cloudy world?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish that we would crawl Ajax.  And in fact, we've been taking some steps toward that.  So at the SMX conference in New York that Danny Sullivan puts on, which is a great search conference,  we proposed a method to crawl Ajax.  And it's not as if we'll crawl your Gmail without permission.  You have to make a few changes to your Ajax URLs instead of just having a hash mark and then state after that.  You'd have to have a hash mark and then an exclamation point.  So it's not as if Google is going to index your Ajax without your permission.  But in the same way that people want to be able to do Flash, they want to be able to do rich media, and they want search engines to keep up,  I think it would be fantastic if search engines would be able to crawl Ajax.  And my wish is that the proposal is well received.  We get good feedback.  And then in a few weeks or a month or whenever, we can sort of nail that down a little bit more and start pushing the web forward a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, how would that work?  Would the Googlebot actually parse the JavaScript and see where the Ajax calls, where the dynamic calls for data were coming from?  Well, that would be the science fiction in the limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Googlebot can parse some JavaScript, but not to the degree that we'd be able to do that quite yet.  So the proposal is basically that you have a they call it a headless browser, which means when someone comes to one of these special URLs and it doesn't matter  whether it's Googlebot or whether it's whether user essentially the web server will render the run the JavaScript, figure out what the final HTML will be,  and then take that HTML snapshot and return that.  And that's what the Googlebot or users can sort of see and index.  But then Googlebot can sort of send you to the Ajax URL directly with any luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, fancy.  I love that.  I think it gets us into that whole new kind of pay past the page web.  Right. The idea that Marissa's been talking about, we've talked about a lot in the show of the hyper personal news stream, Twitter search.  It gets you into a whole new dimension of search that's kind of Rod Serle in this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And if if you want, I can throw a quick tip in.  Please.  Yeah, I could.  I was ready.  I could throw out a number or a tip or a wish.  So I throw a wall out.  Well, OK.  Quick tip. You might not have noticed this, but if you go to Google and you do a search, for example, for a product, if you do a search like Kindle,  there's a little line that appears above the search results called options or show options.  We sort of call it the tool belt.  And if you click that one of the new options is fewer shopping sites.  So one of the common complaints we get is people do not want to get show options.  And then way down in there is fewer shopping results.  So you can choose more shopping results if you want to do some comparison shopping or if you want reviews of your Kindle or iPod or LCD TV or whatever it is,  you're more likely to get in gadget and people talking about it rather than people trying to sell it to you.  So that's a very common request.  And I'm glad that we can sort of provide that functionality.  I think that's a pretty fun tip.  You got a number too?  Yeah, a number. Absolutely.  One million, which is the number of views we're about to hit on our Webmaster video channel.  So we've made about 150 little two minute short videos that answer common people's questions.  If you do a Google search for Webmaster video channel, it's the it's the first result from YouTube.  And when we hit exactly one million, which will happen in the next week or so, we're going to post a fun video.  I think people will enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonderful. By the way, I want to note that the chat room is debating now what a billion squared is.  I'm delighted to see that.  Liz, I've already given my wish, which is Liz, I want you to learn, wave and work out with news.  That's my wish. What's your wish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wish is I wish that Google Docs supported mail merge because it's the one thing that keeps me from moving a lot of my workflow into Google Docs is that I am deeply dependent on being able to merge spreadsheet, word processing and email together.  And without those, that capability without particularly without the mail merge capability, you know, I can't use Google Docs for anything serious.  And so I really hope that that's coming.  Gina, your wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good one. Yeah, yeah.  So so my wish and this is kind of it's kind of cool because I can hassle Matt about it a little bit.  Although I know Matt, I don't think this is what you do specifically.  But my wish has to do with Google Groups.  I run a few Google Groups for a couple of open source projects and other things.  And and there's a spam problem.  And it makes me so sad because Gmail is so good at spam and dealing with spam.  And and there just aren't the there aren't controls for Google Groups, as many controls as I'd like.  So I've had to make my Google Groups lists, you know, approval only.  So I have to approve every every message from a new user.  So if you want to run a Google, you know, an open group, basically I have to I have to green light every single post that goes through.  So I avoid the like, you know, Viagra and check out my webcam messages that go out a lot, a lot more than I thought.  So so better spam filtering and more and easier filtering options.  Like I'd like to just be able to say, you know, any any message that contains the word Viagra or has excessive links, you know, to to moderate to put that aside for moderation automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a very good wish.  I can I'm more than happy to pass that on because I think I know some of the people working in that area.  And I know that they have gotten much better about spam on groups, but it's not completely finished.  So I can definitely go and sort of check with people and ask what's up and sort of, you know, are there any new things coming down the pipe that might help with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent friends in high places. Excellent. Thank you.  Happy ending to twig number 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to thank our wonderful panelists.  Always Gina Tripani of sport aware dot org.  Liz Lolly from the Rochester Institute of Technology.  And I'm sorry, Liz, give me your URL for the project again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Picture the impossible dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, Matt Cutts, who's kind enough to come in from Google and show off his new dude.  And I also want to thank the folks in the chat room who were very kind and not making fun of the fact that I'm Leo light.  So Leo, come back.  We need you.  Thank you very much.  And that's another twin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.
