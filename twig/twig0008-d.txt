Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Jeff.  Hey there.  How you feeling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright.  I'm doing alright.  If I collapse, don't mind me, but I'm doing fine.  Oh, I'm so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was following your tweets to make sure everything was okay and your son Jake  I think tweeted first saying you went through surgery with flying colors on Monday and I  was so happy to hear that.  Yeah, alright.  So glad to have you back.  And, we have a new person on the show today from eWEEK Magazine.  He does the Google Watch column at GoogleWatch.eWEEK.com.  Clint Bolton, welcome to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks for having me on, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's in beautiful Trumbull, Connecticut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Are the leaves turning in Trumbull?  I think they would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  We're getting red, green, gold, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm jealous.  I'm jealous.  Beautiful.  Well, I'm glad you're here because Gina, Jeff, and I have no idea what any of this stuff  means.  Actually, Jeff probably does because he's following it, but the Department of Justice has now weighed  on the proposed Google Books search settlement.  And Gina and I, before the show, were both confessing that this is all way too complicated.  It is.  It's too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please make sense of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So could you, Clint, it would be really useful for us if you'd at least set us up going back  as far back as you want.  What is going on with Google Books search?  What's the issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing with Google Books search is obviously it's an effort for Google to catalog  the world's books online.  They want to take millions of works, especially orphan books, books that are out of print  and whose authors can't be found, to get permission and to get clearance about this.  So it's a big deal because a lot of people are up in arms.  They're concerned with antitrust issues.  There's concern with privacy issues.  And a lot of the competitors that Google has, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, they're concerned  that Google is going to extend their purview over the internet even more with searches  and whatnot if this Google Book deal does go through.  Privacy issues are a big deal because it involves Google cataloging a lot of the users' content.  When a user goes and does a book search, obviously it gets tracked through the IP address.  Google says it's not saving that information.  But the privacy folks, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, want to make sure that  there are safeguards in place so that users' privacy rights are protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems like everybody has an opinion on this.  The lawsuit happened, and it was a class, I believe it was a class action lawsuit, from  the publishers and the book authors.  And that was settled last year.  Google agreed to set up, well, there was $125 million to set up some sort of publishing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Google Book Rights Registry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rights Registry, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And this was October 2008 that this deal was signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now a judge is going to make a decision exactly, almost exactly a year later.  I think it's October 10th.  October 7th.  Okay, exactly a year later.  He'll be ruling on whether this settlement can go forward or whether there'll be changes  to it.  And everybody's filed briefs from Amazon and Microsoft.  Gary Reback's been hired, the attorney who got the DOJ sicked on Microsoft 10 years ago.  He's been hired by Amazon, Microsoft, and some other parties, including, I think, was  the EFF part of this group to kind of, I guess, derail the settlement.  The biggest news this week was that the Department of Justice on Friday filed its own brief,  in which the kind of the bottom line was, keep going, keep talking, but this settlement  isn't sufficient and doesn't rep...  It sounded like the DOJ said, this is really a matter for Congress, not for a civil settlement  that will effectively change copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Leo, too, the coverage of that DOJ thing was amazing because it was kind of anti-Google  and everyone said that the DOJ rejected the settlement.  DOJ, in fact, said, and for their own press release, I'll quote here, that a properly  structured set agreement, in this case, offers the potential for important societal benefits.  The United States does not want the opportunity or momentum to be lost.  So they're saying that they want, quote unquote, improvements in the settlement.  They still want something to happen.  I think we have to pull back here and say, what's the good of society?  And the good of society is to have books digitized, the thoughts in them carried on and able to  reach new people.  Well, especially these orphan works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are books that are out of print.  They're not out of copyright because copyright is now infinite, apparently, according to  Mickey Mouse.  And so...  As old as Mickey Mouse.  As old as Mickey Mouse.  And as long as Mickey Mouse continues to age, so will the copyright law.  And so as a result, a lot of these books are going to be lost.  They're not public domain, all the public domain stuff.  There's no question there.  But nor are they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And all the things that have authors and publishers associated with them, they have the right  to determine what's what.  And in fact, some of the things people don't like aren't from Google, they're from the  putting DRM-like requirements on their own work, which is...  That's the world we're in.  I'm kind of with you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a huge public boon to having this stuff online.  But I also fully understand the issues because Google isn't just scanning it and saying,  here, we're going to make it available to everybody.  There's a lot of restrictions on what they're doing with this material.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  There's issues in terms of what libraries will be charged.  There's issues in terms of the revenue split that Google will now be able to sell these  orphan books online or pay books online.  Yeah, they may become a publisher themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They may say, oh, we got all the orphan works.  And I think it was in the language, we're the only ones that can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the issue that's got to get surely opened up here.  And that's part of the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think this is a good process.  Gina, I'm sorry, you were saying something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, my dumb question is, how is this different than the way that Google indexes  the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  That's a good question to be asking.  I don't think it is very different.  But the fact is that there's, when you're talking about rights holders and when you're  talking about the monopoly issue, Amazon has a big concern about this because they're obviously  scanning their own books online and offering them via the Kindle e-reader.  So they don't want this to happen at all because they feel that they're going to get cut out  of a big slice of the pie, the book scanning pie.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tony, with their new e-book readers saying, we have more books on Amazon because we've  got the Google stuff on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One million books.  One million books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All from Google.  Yeah.  Google opened up to those other readers.  And that's part of what they've been doing in terms of trying to get the PR going here.  Gina, I think, and I think Siva, but nothing we'll have on later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have Siva on for sure to talk about this in great detail.  University of Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he's the author of a book called The Googolization of Everything.  And he and I clash on this, but in a friendly way.  But I think the essence of the answer to your question is this.  In the rest of the web, Google is not the host of the content.  In the case of these books, Google is scanning the content and becomes the host of it and  thus gains some measure of potential control over it that concerns people and for which  there need to be protections.  Everywhere else, Google is, yeah, they're putting it on their servers so that they can  index it, but they are not the host of the content.  I heard it's interesting because I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but to your point, Gina, some have said, in fact, some legal, a number of legal experts  have said that they were puzzled that Google settled.  They would have liked to see Google assert a fair use defense because, in fact, it is  very much they're not when they scan the book, they index it.  I mean, there is this whole issue of what do they do with the scan?  They index, I mean, they store, they index my web page and your web page.  They store a copy of it, Gina, on their servers.  Not the only copy.  It's not the canonical copy, but they do store a copy.  And what the book search originally was is you search for information and you would get  a snippet.  You wouldn't get the whole book, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's just like I can do on Amazon today.  And for the books that are in Amazon's database, I can do that today and it's useful, but I  can't get to it from the web.  And so the ideas are kind of trapped behind Amazon's wall.  And Google, as is Google's want, wants to open up at least the information.  But when you find that snippet, that information, you then can have the opportunity to buy the  book online and read it and Google will sell it to you if the author and publisher have  agreed and if they can find said author and publisher.  So it is a different structure, but you're absolutely right.  There's a fair use issue here we have to be careful of because if Google and Daylife,  where I work, and Bing cannot hold on to a copy of content so they can be smarter about  it, then there goes search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  But Jeff, I mean, well, let me ask Clint this actually.  Do you have a sense of why Google didn't assert a fair use defense?  Why Google went right to the settlement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they thought that paying the $125 was the quickest way to solve something that  could have lasted, a suit that could have lasted for years and years.  And I don't think Google, for competitive reasons, wanted to wait on this.  I think they want to do this as quickly and as cleanly as possible, which is why I think  they made that payment or tried to make that payment October 2008.  And I think that's, you know, they want things to go as smoothly as possible because again,  you know, this is about competition here for Google and the faster that they can do this.  Look, they index the web faster than anybody, right?  And they cultivated over 11 years a search dominance by being the first to everything  after a while.  And that's really what they want to do with Google Book Search.  They want to get in there first and they want to index as many titles as they can online.  It's going to increase search traffic and, you know, it's going to increase advertising  revenue because everybody's going to get it cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and at the time that made the settlement, I think Microsoft was still doing this.  So there was some competition for Microsoft, but Microsoft's pulled out of their book scanning  initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Microsoft pulled out in May 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really it's Google and nobody.  In fact, some people said, well, if Google doesn't do this, who's going to do this?  Is there anybody?  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly the issue.  No one's doing it.  The publishers have had digital copies for years.  They haven't done anything about this.  They could have set up this structure.  I was wondering whether there was a cloud way to do this.  Is there a way that you could have a Gutenberg project like way with these roughened books  where we the people put it in the cloud somehow, but somebody has to do the work, which is  very expensive and store it, which is also expensive.  Google's one step forward.  I think the main issue is that as long as others aren't prevented from doing this, that's  the real issue.  Is anyone else willing to invest in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also the issue of bad metadata.  Jeffrey Nunberg, who's a linguist and has a library blog says, if you've looked at the  metadata, it's got awful.  He said half the books are from 1899, even though none of them are from 1899.  And he says it's not useful for researchers.  So some of the benefit to the public of this is it may not materialize.  Now I think Google probably feels like, well, this is something that we can crowdsource  that the internet can solve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish they'd open it up.  That's exactly the way it reflects.  There's some other great things like footnote.org.  I think it's called that enables people to go into all kinds of databases and annotate  them and link them and add stuff together, add data to them.  There's also the Smithsonian, I think it is, or the Library of Congress photos that are  up on a flicker.  It's exactly what we ought to do is have this as an open project of all the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that's what I hope from, and who knows what the judge is going to do,  but that's what I would hope from all of this is, yeah, Google, there should be some oversight.  It needs to be opened up.  I think I would hope that Google wants to do this and make it more open and assert maybe  They're not going to monetize this by selling the books.  They're going to monetize it as they monetize everything else.  It's more eyeballs, right?  Do they need to sell these books?  Could they not make these somehow more open and available to others?  I think that would solve a lot of concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but that was the offer back was to say that we're not going to open this up so that  you lose value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will help you.  That was their response.  I see.  Right.  Now, what about the privacy concerns?  Because a lot of scholars are very worried that Google will, as you said, monitor who's  reading what.  Libraries are very careful and try very hard, despite the Patriot Act, to protect users'  privacy.  Google has none of those restrictions.  Do you think that's an issue, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Privacy is always a concern and it's always there.  The problem is, I think, that it becomes the default response to everything today is to  raise privacy flags and worry about that and then to lose sight of the benefit of public  instead of having these things in public.  It's terms of use.  It's the time the data is held and it's subpoena-able and can be subpoenaed.  Those are the issues, the same with our web habits.  No difference, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made this point to the NPR.  Just like the web.  That's what I said to the NPR producer is your internet service provider knows everything  about you, knows a lot more than Google knows about you.  I don't hear everybody worried about that.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I was just going to say, Google knows all the web pages that you find.  So if they know all the books that you look at.  It's the same exact issue as web search.  Going back to what you were saying earlier about crowdsourcing this and opening it up,  the ReCAPTCHA acquisition is a very tiny step toward that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about that because ReCAPTCHA, I thought, was owned by Carnegie Mellon.  I thought this was kind of an open project, but Google just bought it.  Tell us about why ReCAPTCHA helps Google Book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the way that ReCAPTCHA works is that there's two words.  It's basically the, you know, prove your human little form, right?  But there are two words, one that the web page knows what it should be and the other  that it's not sure what it should be, but you don't know which one it knows.  So you type in both words.  And if you're correct on the first one, it assumes ReCAPTCHA assumes that you're correct  on the second one.  Now, the second image is a scanned piece of text that the OCR software wasn't able to  determine was correct.  Right.  So in a sense, you're helping them, you know, text, you know, recognize text on books.  So now if Google Books or Google hasn't done this already, I'm sure they will.  The bits of text from those old books that the OCR didn't work for, they're going to  chop them up and send them out via ReCAPTCHA, which is across, you know, so many sites at  this point. And he will be helped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, though, that as far as I can tell, Google didn't use ReCAPTCHA.  I just signed up for a bunch of Gmail accounts so we could have Google Voice accounts for  all the shows.  And it never used ReCAPTCHA.  It used its own capture, which wasn't as good as ReCAPTCHA.  So I hope they start using ReCAPTCHA across Google.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, it would be bizarre if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  All right. Well, that's good news.  Now, the other news story that was a big news story this week, and we will be talking a  lot more about Book Search over the next month as we get closer and closer to this  judicial decision.  And I don't think that the judge is going to decide everything.  That's my sense is that the judge is October 7th.  The judge is going to have a hearing, but he's not going to decide anything at that  time, or is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not clear exactly, to tell you the truth.  He could.  It's a fairness. He could.  But there's a good chance this is going to be drawn out.  I expect Judge Denny Chin in the Southern District of New York to really take a hard  look at this and especially paying attention to what the Department of Justice has said,  looking at the antitrust concerns, the concerns about monopolization of Google Book Search,  the privacy concerns, the class action concerns.  The DOJ is not happy with the way Google Book Search deals with the federal rights procedure,  rule 23.  This is something that is going to get dragged out.  And I expect Denny Chin to ask Google to make a lot of the changes that the Department of  Justice has suggested.  So I expect this to drag on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the DOJ brief was really pretty good.  I mean, it really addressed all the issues.  I agree.  It also said that some of this stuff really shouldn't be decided by anybody but Congress.  This is not the place to decide some of these copyright issues.  So maybe some of those things will be thrown out.  Anyway, as I started to say, we're going to be talking a lot more about this.  And when Siva comes on, I think we might even spend a whole show talking about the Google  Book Search because I agree with you, Jeff, this has huge potential.  We want these books scanned in.  We just have to do it in a fair and correct way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Siva understands where all those issues lie.  I don't think he'd disagree about the benefits here, but he understands well, and can say  it far better than I can.  Right.  Where perceived dangers are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So besides buying ReCAPTCHA, there was a rumor created by one single tweet, I might add,  that Google might buy Brightcove.  Is there any news on that?  Or was that just that one tweet and then it just disappeared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't seen any more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a retweet.  Clint, have you seen it?  Everybody retweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  Everybody retweeted it.  That makes it true.  And then I think somebody went out and sort of disproved it or at least said that there  was nothing going on along those lines.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Mark Glaser of PBS's Media Shift who tweeted it.  And I guess that's some credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  Well, everybody wants to now, with the acquisitions of Google trying to acquire onto technologies  and then ReCAPTCHA, everybody wants to take a look at what Google's going to buy next.  It's very fashionable to figure out what direction they're going in next.  What are they up to?  If you get a company like Brightcove on top of YouTube, you can make a case for Google  owning video on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Somebody commented that they wish we had talked more about Android last week.  I'm going to let Gina, Gina is the resident Android expert.  There were a couple of Android phones announced and very interestingly, a tablet from Arcos,  the Arcos 9 built on the Android platform.  Did you look at any of these, Gina, with interest?  I know.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen them yet.  I'm excited about the October 11th release.  Is it the Hero that's coming the 11th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Hero, yeah.  HTC Hero, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I didn't get a chance to check out the new ones that came out, but I'm very excited  about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a Motorola Click, which is, the UI is completely redesigned.  It's Android under the hood, but it floats by tweets and Facebook postings like the screensavers  floating around with all your social cloud of stuff going around, which is kind of wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see that being irritating or groundbreaking.  But it goes back to, Marissa Meyer said, as I've quoted a few times here, that we're  talking about the hyper personal news stream.  Dave Weiner talks about the river of news.  I think that this idea that once you're ubiquitously constantly connected, then the idea that something  rings for you is a bit odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Who needs a ring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click does seem like a very socially oriented phone, a social networking phone that I think  that it is well timed for Christmas season, for the holiday season, the buying season.  This is something that could really take off with teens and 20-somethings who are using  social networks to communicate.  It could be a big deal.  It could be a big deal for Motorola, who really needs a big win here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hero does some of the same things.  It's not as, I think that the click is for people under, people Jake's age, people under  And the hero is more for people Gina's age.  And I've got a razor for you and me, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that Motorola razor is going somewhere.  A phone that's just a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hero is going to, apparently with a UI, going to surface also surface flicker pictures  and things like that.  This seems to be a trend in Android devices.  That's maybe one complaint people have about Android is that it's UI is kind of stuffy,  but you're not tied to the UI at all, it sounds like.  You can do anything you want with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You aren't tied to it.  Later on, I'll talk about it in my tip.  My love for Android was renewed this week.  I flashed a, I installed a custom ROM, which was very exciting.  I'll talk about that a little later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't donut.  This is firmware or not a different.  Developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a, it's a custom build of Android that actually pulls in some of Donuts features,  which is pretty cool because you get them on the G1.  So save it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I should mention.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was going to say you start to say about different generations on the web.  We should, I would love to talk about the mint acquisition and some of the reaction  about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now we, Gina has always been very clear with me on this show that it's not just Google,  it's cloud computing as well.  And in fact, because of you, Gina, and your blog post saying it's safe to use mint, I  installed mint and actually because of that and the iPhone application fell in love with  it, put every account in there and then quick and to it bought it.  Bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, first let me say that at some point I said, you know, I'm just going to stop  being paranoid and give in and try out mint.  I mean, I, you know, I know it's a safe as far as, you know, it's privacy policy in terms  of use that kind of thing.  And I love it.  Oh, I do too.  You know, it's a great app.  Fantastic.  And I went to it because I didn't want to use quick and anymore.  So you know, you hear about the Intuit acquisition.  It's just like, oh, you know, I mean, I mean, it's what had quick online, which, which wasn't  terrible.  And there was an iPhone app, which, you know, it wasn't so bad, but mint was better.  But I thought the reaction was so was, was interesting.  37 signals, Jason Fried posted a post about how, you know, mint gave in to the old generation.  The old generation is sucking up the new generation of the web.  And I thought that was such an interesting reaction because actually I think it was Derek  Powisak who said, you know, the web, there are no generation.  Right.  Now we're all, the web is just a stream and we're all in it together.  You know, there's no generational conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If somebody offers me $170 million, I don't know if I'm going to be so worried about generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you going to do, Leo?  Come home and say, honey, I turned down $170 million and I'm such a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were the wrong generation.  I just couldn't go with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, man, that was the old school.  Well, let me ask.  There was an argument about, about VCs forcing this, but Fred Wilson on his blog, abc.com,  it was obviously a VC said, you know, it doesn't really happen much that way.  That if, if the founders want to sell, you're pretty foolish to keep to force them not to  because they're going to be pissed.  Right.  And he's been through that a few times, I think with delicious and places like that  where somebody comes home and they say, well, here's a life changing amount of money.  I'm taking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, I think that that was such a huge amount of money.  I can't, I can't see how anybody could turn it down.  Except maybe my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, how is this any different than, you know, a larger entrenched company  buying a startup?  You know, I mean, what is, what is the difference here?  This has been going on.  Exactly what happened.  Nobody, nobody complains when IBM goes and buys a startup, you know, or when Microsoft  goes and buys a startup.  You did hear some outcry when Google went to acquire onto technologies, but those are,  you know, for different reasons.  So I don't know.  I don't understand the, what everybody's getting upset with.  Although I should clarify that I'm not an Intuit or a Mint user.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, Clint.  It's interesting too, that if you think back to other companies that have screwed up startups  they bought, the worst I think was AOL.  Everything it bought died or turned to crap.  Yahoo is half and half.  It really depends on what happens to the company.  Right.

Transcript:  Although I should point out stealthily and sneakily AOL has snuck back in.  And now they have a dozen very profitable properties and all of a sudden AOL is the  king of the blogs.  You know, I mean getting Weblogs Inc and a few other things together, AOL kind of reinvented  itself.  So I don't know if you can say AOL, you know, certainly the Time Warner thing was a bad  idea.  Who's done bad?  You know, Google's done badly with a lot of its acquisitions.  In fact, we were trying to get Yuri Engstrom on and we're to still try to get him on of  Jaikou fame and one of the companies Google bought and didn't really seem to do anything  with.  Yahoo, of course, famous, although again, they have a ton of properties that are incredibly  successful and valuable.  AOL.  Skype and eBay.  Oh, there's a bad one.  In fact, the latest news on Skype is it looks, who knows what's going to happen now?  Lawsuits are flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's absolutely all tied up in legal.  It's a huge amount of illegal legal embryos here and it's not clear how that's going to  shake out.  But it seems as though the direction that it's heading in is that eBay shareholders  could take a big hit from this, depending on how the lawsuit shakes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care if they take a hit as long as Skype doesn't go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, yeah, that would be disastrous.  But I don't I don't see how that could happen.  I don't I really don't expect to mean there's almost 500 million users of Skype.  That would absolutely be disastrous.  Talk about too big to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I mean, I was talking about this on the radio show, you know, Johnson sent  in the troops to keep the steel factories running.  I wonder if Obama would send in, I don't know what he'd send in the IT guys to keep Skype  running.  I mean, talk about too big to fail.  You can't we can't lose Skype.  This whole show, this my whole network's running on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But there's really nothing you can do about it until this copyright infringement suit is  settled.  You know, they own the IP.  They own the core source code technology.  And there's nothing that can be done about that unless that's settled.  So this is going to be tied up.  I expect a cash settlement of some sort, a big one coming going to the Skype guys or  the former Skype guys, I should say, now the jolted guys.  You know, so I expect them to get a big cash settlement and possibly for them to try if  they could make another run at Skype, you know, because this is not a done deal.  Skype eBay selling 65 percent of Skype to Silver Lake and other investors and recent  horrors. This is far from a done deal, especially with these lawsuits.  So there's a lot of ways.  We're not trying to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that one of the scenarios?  Is that put them in a position where I could figure out how this happens?  How does it put the founders in a position to be able to take the company back over because  of the suit?  Is it is it?  You know, a deuce around everybody else?  How would that work?  Well, they own the IP.  I believe so.  They own the IP.  They have they have the the golden snitch and can buy it for a lower price than is out  there now because otherwise they're going to get paid the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, whatever whoever's got whatever else they have, all they have is a name and some  a ball of useless technology.  Right. So it's just like Quidditch.  You know, you can play and be leading in points for three hours and somebody gets a snitch.  It's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was very geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Without that IP, without that IP, Skype doesn't really it doesn't have the value to the investors  that are putting money into it.  You know, the two million dollars or whatever it is there, two billion dollars that they're  investing into it.  So without that intellectual property, you know, it's going to be a huge problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you got? You got nothing.  Right. Yeah. Right.  The paywall got a little higher.  This is one for Jeff Jarvis.  Got a little higher this week when Wall Street Journal said, oh, by the way, those of you  who use our iPhone application, we may from time to time charge you to to read.  This is what Rupert Murdoch said would happen.  The journal is the only publication ever to as that I know of that succeeded with a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Journal and the Financial Times and the reason is, frankly, I thought it was always odd that  the journal's iPhone app was free.  It was a back door I think somebody forgot about along the way.  And now Rupert said, would you close that kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's one more back door.  And I'd be really mad if they close this.  If you find a Wall Street Journal Journal article with Google News for reasons I'll  never understand, you can click through to that journal article and read it in full.  If you try to go it otherwise, it'll say, well, you're not a subscriber.  You can only read a summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh. Because there are people there who understand the value of marketing and links.  I saw we've got to figure that out.  I saw that the BBC, I forget the number, puts out a few 10 million links, clicks a month  to other news sources.  And I have to look that up in a minute.  I'll find that.  Whereas, as I mentioned on the show before, Google News sends out a billion clicks a month.  So you'd have to be pretty much a fool to pass that up to your competitor because your  competitor's stories are right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So you don't think it's a case of oversight as it was with the iPhone.  You think this is an intentional hole, but it's a pretty big hole.  Frankly, I am, but I don't need to be a Wall Street Journal online subscriber because I  can just use Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus, if you come to an individual's story, that's not the value of the Wall Street Journal.  The value of the Wall Street Journal is to be a subscriber.  And maybe you'll become a subscriber.  It's the best way to sell.  Online, your content is your ad.  And so it's the best way to sell your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're hoping maybe after a few times going to Google News to get the story, I'll  just buy it and use it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And don't forget, their traffic is low.  And so this causes more traffic and causes more ad inventory on that traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their traffic is low because of the paywall, you think?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they need, that's part of the reason they bought MarketWatch back in the day is they  needed open free traffic to get more ad inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem with the paywall.  It's kind of this catch-22.  And if you don't get people to pay, then you're really screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  You charge $100 a year for a subscription, which no one else is doing.  But if people, there's many, many other sources, obviously, as everyone here knows, to go and  get news.  Some 20-something thousand news sources indexed by Google.  Why are people going to go to the Wall Street Journal?  What is the impetus?  What reason would they have to go there for $100 a year?  That's a lot of money when everybody's used to getting stuff for free on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just read a great essay from Paul Graham of Y Combinator just before I got on here.  Wonderful essays arguing that we've never bought content and publishers have never sold  it.  That if we did buy it, then better content would cost more.  Instead, it's the form that dictates price.  That's interesting.  They said that selling information is different.  That's why, in fact, Wall Street Journal does do well on paid because people make money  on it.  Your terminal is worth a lot of money because you're buying information in that case.  We don't really buy content.  The only way to sell it in the future, he argues, is either by getting it through the  side door, which is advertising, or by attaching it to a device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's the form.  Then you're buying the form.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's brilliant.  I just think he's amazing.  That's an interesting take.  Is it the take of Chris Anderson and Free?  Is it the same basic thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.  Graham goes through ... I blogged about it quickly and I said, I've got to think about  it a little more, but I think it's up there with Clay Shirky's amazing essay called Thinking  the Unthinkable about newspapers and why pay won't work.  He's looking at it in that very abstract, wonderful way, but then goes into every possible  kind of content and says why charging won't work and why this is where we are and how  we have to look at it.  Then he also says, he apologizes at the end for saying, I'm sorry I'm writing about this  in the context of old forms.  That's because I don't know what the new forms are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul always just blows my mind.  I like to read his stuff because it just opens up all sorts of thoughts.  I want to take a break, talk a little bit about audible.com.  We have a phone number now that people can call us.  We actually have a Google voice line.  If you want to call with feedback or questions or suggestions, 9795 twigvm.  That's the easy to remember ... Sort of easy to remember.  9795 twigvm or just plus one 979-589-4486.  Leave a message.  Remember that when you leave a message, you're giving us permission to use it on the show  and try to keep it under a minute.  I'm not likely to use it if it gets too much longer because Jeff has pizza night.  We can't go on and on and on.  We do have like 80 calls and I'll get to a few of them in just a little bit.  Before I do that, I want to thank our sponsor today, of course, audible.com, publishers  of Jeff's great book and audio, but many other books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got in trouble last time.  Did you?  Too many plugs for the book.  What would Google do?  I promised that I wouldn't plug the book.  What would Google do this time?  Because audible would let us and I was just trying to joke about the fact that they wouldn't  let me plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to do it anymore.  Not this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Google had an audio book on audible.com, I think they would plug it.  That's what Google would do.  It makes perfect sense.  You said that.  I didn't.  Makes perfect sense.  audible.com is a great place to go.  If you like podcasts, this is just one more wonderful source of great literature, audiblepodcast.com  slash twig.  Now, this actually, I don't know if this confirms Paul's theory or not.  I think it does because they're not selling the device, but they're selling the form of  audio books.  Believe me, you can listen to an audio book, have your Kindle read it to you.  It ain't the same as having somebody who really knows how to bring a book to life read to  you and that's what they do.  They are so good about making these books jump to life, whether it's Sense and Sensibility  and Sea Monsters, which is the newest Jane Austen novel, or Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol.  I can't frankly read Dan Brown in paper with a straight face, but they make wonderful audio  books because basically it's like you listen to the movie.  You can just see Tom Hanks running around.  audible.com, I'm sorry, audiblepodcast.com slash twig.  If you go there right now, you can sign up for a gold account that gives you a book a  month and your first one's free.  In fact, even if you cancel, you get to keep that one for the rest of your life.  So pick wisely in business and classics, history, non-fiction and fiction, kids and young adults  even, mysteries and thrillers, romance, science and technology, sci-fi, self-development and  more.  They even have comedy performances, old time radio shows.  It's just a feast of audio listening entertainment.  I don't know what I'm going to recommend today.  There's so many great books out there.  The big download of course, The Lost Symbol.  I've been reading a lot of rave reviews.  In fact, I guess I'll reckon since we were talking about performance, I haven't read  told this is an amazing performance.  It's called The Help by Catherine Stockett.  It is the highest rated book ever on audible.com.  4.89 out of 5 based on 1,831 ratings.  And I think it's because of the performance.  Cassandra Campbell, Jenna Lamia, Octavia Spencer and Bonnie Turpin.  Apparently a brilliant performance of The Help by Catherine Stockett.  Make that our pick of the week.  The point is you get to choose audible.com, audiblepodcast.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support this week in Google.  Audiblepodcast.com slash twig.  You might be tempted to use a different code.  Use that code because then we get credit.  We want Gina and Jeff to get the credit for a job well done.  And whatever you do, don't listen to what would Google do.  It's too good of a book.  You'll have to buy it.  And we wouldn't want that, would we, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't say it worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an example, though, I think of what Paul was talking about because it is in a  way you're not buying the book.  You're buying the performance.  You're buying the form.  You're buying the ability to put it on your portable device.  And that kind of makes sense.  That's the value I'm getting out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism and I was out this last class for obvious  reasons.  And my substitute friend told me that some students were thinking about doing books.  And I said, well, that's not really a business.  Well, no, if they rethink it in terms of an ongoing business and it's just part of the  process.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll consider that.  It is a business in a way.  Yeah.  But that's actually the challenge.  And actually, I think that's kind of fun because in order to understand this, you have to rethink  it.  It's kind of a good exercise to rethink every business in this new form.  What is an appropriate form going forward for any business, whether it's the record  industry, the book industry, and there probably is an appropriate form for everything, I would  imagine.  So, do you want to hear some of our feedback from our many, many callers or should actually,  why don't we do, I'm trying to decide what order to do this.  Why don't we do our tip and pick and everything.  And that way, if Jeff needs to run, he can.  How about that?  Because it is pizza night.  Is every Saturday pizza night, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Metaphorically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's start with Gina Trapani.  We missed you last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our tip of the week, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool.  Yay.  Okay.  My tip of the week is for adventurous Android users.  And I got to tell you, I don't think there is any other kind.  If you're using Android, you're probably pretty adventurous.  You're a leader.  Yeah.  But yeah, an early adopter.  So I moved into a new place this week and it's a new building and the wiring was bad  and I didn't have, I did not have internet access at home, which just killed me.  It totally killed me.  I'm serious.  I'm still recovering.  But so I finally took the leap and I got root access to my Android phone, which let me tether.  And so in order to get basically getting root access to your Android phone lets you install  a custom build of Android.  And there are lots of custom builds of Androids out there.  Some of them include some of the donut features.  Most of them include give you root access to the device, which opens up a little extra  functionality.  And in order to do it, there's an application called Recovery Flasher, which you download  from the web because you know there's no pesky iTunes store approval process to deal with.  Of course, I had to say that.  And you download that to your phone just through the phone's web browser and it lets you boot  and install a custom Android build.  So it's a few steps and it takes a little time and you lose some of your settings, but  I have it all written up at smartware.org, which we'll link in the show notes.  So I use the Cyanogen mod.  I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.  And I just fell in love with Android all over again.  My G went so much faster.  I have a better keyboard and I also can now tether.  It's a one click tether so I can get online anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in every other respect, it looks the same.  You just can do more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks very similar.  Depends on what custom build of Android you install.  I was kind of conservative and went with a stable build of Cyanogen mod and it looks  very similar.  But it gives you that tethering.  I downloaded that tethering app and it gives you a terminal and some other good looking  stuff.  There's a keyboard.  The keyboard is a little better, which I believe is coming in donut.  But there are other builds that will give you applications that are coming out on different  Android devices that not all Android devices get.  So there's a database of Android builds and you can choose which build you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's this guy talking on your video?  Is that you?  I'm simply doing God's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy that helped me.  No, no, no.  This is the guy who did a video describing how to do the flashing process, which really  helped me out.  I read a bunch of tutorials and that guy's video was the thing that got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny now we're starting to do, you know, I always thought it would be so much easier  in text and sometimes now it is.  It's a lot easier just to watch a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  It's true.  That video is really short and easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  SmarterWear.org, a great place to go for lots of tips.  Gina's just cranking them out these days.  I tell you.  But also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot as fast as when I had internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and you know, we should say Gina's on wireless today and I think that's where the  coming and going is.  There's a little bit of a dropout on you.  So I will, we'll get you wired next time.  But your internet's okay.  It's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry about.  Yeah, it's working.  It's working now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  Hallelujah.  And now our number of the week.  And that comes to us from the great Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in a dog ate my homework moment, my number was going to be five, which is the  whole body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I almost said is your number going to be five.  I almost said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, while we're at it, I had robotic surgery for prostate this week.  That's why I'm like, fascinating thing was just a little geek moment.  They put you out an hour before the surgery because people get freaked seeing the robot  assembled above them.  Oh, I would.  I went into the room and it was like seeing a Sigourney Weaver enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know it was robotic.  When you say robotic, it's not an autonomous robot.  There's somebody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's robot assisted.  Yeah, surgery.  The robot is five feet away from you in a monitor controlling the stuff and has five  little arms inside you.  I'll stop there.  And why do they do it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's...  Is it micro surgery or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's orthoscopic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  So they're using a camera and...  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  I did write about it on my blog.  If you have the stomach for it, I've got the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have pictures of the robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a little picture of the robot.  They always try to show the robot on the website being really small.  I said on the website, it's like the kind of robot that turns knobs on Cooper Minis  or something.  And you walk in the room and it's this really amusing, huge Sigourney Weaver thing.  But the robot was my friend.  So anyway, so I was going to not have a number, but at the last minute, the number is 300  million, which is the number of users, of course, that Facebook has these days, which  leads to a John Battelle post saying that...  Oh, I love having a theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We ought to have a content...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was queuing up my tip and it started playing.  I hate it when pages start playing music.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's worse when somebody points it out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  I'm glad you did.  Otherwise, I would have had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Battelle says that Facebook's automated ad system is getting preference from a lot  of advertisers versus Google because you're targeting on a social action rather than on  content.  You have that happening and you also have Google announcing this week that it's extending  a double-click into now a marketplace for display ads at quality sites.  I asked Rashad Tamakawalla, who's the head of strategy at Starcom, a big ad agency on  Twitter right before the show, what this means.  And he says he thinks it means there'll be a lot of new money in the marketplace as a  result.  So it ain't over and there's now all kinds of new battle fronts for ad dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very interesting.  I like it.  It's good for us as new media.  We like to hear that.  The more money that's floating around, the more I can grab out of the sky.  My tool is actually a terrible, horrible thing, but if I don't do it, everybody's going to  yell at me.  And it's this new Google Fast Flip.  And I think it actually is something that we could talk about because it doesn't make  any sense.  It's like, why is Google doing this?  Google Fast Flip, which is from Google Labs.  If you go to Google Labs, you can get fastflip.googlelabs.com is designed to make it more reading your  news more like reading a paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you see, you know, you could do it by topic.  It's not a replacement for Google Reader.  You could check sources.  You can check topics.  You know, it has trending topics.  In fact, it's really what it apparently is, as far as I could tell, is a search, is a  search engine where you'll enter in a search using the word section before it, and then  you'll get a variety of pages that you then click down into.  And it takes two clicks to get to the original source, but you can you could scroll through  it.  It is a very strange idea.  And some say it's a MacGuffin, that it's Google's way of showing the newspapers it's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I liken it to us when you used to scroll through the microfiche in a library.  Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.  Go and scroll, scroll, scroll.  Do people read newspapers that way?  I don't know.  You know, if you're doing if you're just casually reading a newspaper, you're not going to do  that.  You're doing research and you need to look through a lot of content, you know, for a  longer period of time.  You might do that.  You might do scans like that to search for certain articles.  And it might be a very beneficial and efficient way to do that.  I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're looking for pictures or you're you're looking for scanning for concepts, you're  right.  That's a better way to do it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think a lot of the media jumped on this and absolutely slammed Google and  said a lot of the coverage that I had read from my peers and colleagues, they didn't  like this at all.  They said it was a lousy service.  You know, I disagree.  I don't think it's a lousy service.  I mean, it is what it is.  It's another way to search Google.  You know, when the Wonder Wheel was announced and Google Squared were announced, people weren't  bashing those tools.  I think Google's taking a lot of heat over this.  I don't think they proclaimed it as being the next coming of Google News.  But don't get me wrong.  I think they would love it.  They would absolutely love it if people were to search Google News this way and to skip  through stuff because they would see a whole lot more ads.  You know, I did my first run through on this and I saw so many ads.  I did five minutes of testing on this.  So many ads.  And you know, you know, clicking on an article about Patrick Swayze last week from Us Magazine  when he had passed away.  And over on the right was an ad from the National Cancer Institute.  Is that morbid or is that tacky or is that ingenious?  I don't know which.  You know, I'll leave that up for you to decide.  But it was it was certainly effective.  It caught my eye.  You know, when I'm reading about Patrick Swayze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every single page for you go through, you get another ad over on the right there.  I didn't even notice that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I did that search and I found the National Cancer Institute ad, you know, next to the  article about Patrick Swayze.  I circled back to that article a couple of minutes later and there was another ad there  for Whitney Houston's new album.  So those ads are changing and they are recycling.  So that's it's pretty smart.  But whether or not people news it, use it on a regular basis, enough to make it a replacement  for Google News, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I was Shane Richmond at The Telegraph in London and I have this link up on the friend  feed did a great letter from fake Eric Schmidt.  You know, we got you suckers.  Happy now, bitches, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of my thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I think it's it's a last week.  I accused Google of being cynical in offering a check out to these fools who want to charge  for newspapers.  I tend to look at this in the same light.  I think it's either a cynical way to say, OK, you want this?  Fine. Here it is.  Or worse, it's a naive way to say, oh, OK, we listen to you fools who messed up the news industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's what you were asking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look. Yeah.  And why give it to them?  The other fear I have with this is I think that we're going down to a limited number of sources.  The beauty of Google and even Google News and Daylife, where I'm a partner, is that they  have thousands of sources.  And that's the true path to serendipity to find the sources you want.  In this, you are limited to a certain number of sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all very mainstream, very mainstream sources.  Right. And Google is at 39.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's where they're trying to if they're trying to suck up to the newspaper  industry and they're doing it sincerely, I see danger in that because Google knows better  than the industry does.  And if we end up with a very limited number of sources, there's a new aggregator out this  week in Germany called Nachrichten.de that has only 500 sources from major sources.  Google had its featured content a few weeks ago.  Now it has this.  That's limiting.  We should be going the opposite way.  At the same time, by the way, note that Google now marks on Google News if content comes  from a blog.  They didn't really explain why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Clint?  No, just that it's part of Google's longstanding efforts to bulk up the search options, just  like they do offering Google searches for past 24 hours and offering more varieties  and more ways for users to search.  Why they're having the blog designation, I'm not quite sure.  But you know, it's again, these are things that are experimental.  They may come and go.  There's a lot of things in Google that they start, they roll out, and eventually they  fade away.  So we'll have to see what happens with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does feel a little bit like it's deprecating it to say, well, just so you know, that's  from a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they do it for a New York Times blog too, does anybody see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't look like they do.  I haven't come across yet.  Yeah.  Well, I just searched for Mint, for instance, and the second entry is the Mint blog.  Doesn't say blog on it, even though it's mint.com slash blog.  So I don't know.  I don't know who gets to be a blog.  Let me search for, let's see, Android.  Let me search for Android hacking.  That'll show up some blogs.  See if I can.  Yeah.  I'm not seeing the designation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.  Anyway, it's worth taking a look at Flip for what it's worth.  I think you make a good point, Clint, that there are some searches that it might be useful  for.  Did you say it's only 39 sources?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, 39 sources.  Sources like TechCrunch, New York Times, Washington Post.  Hey, TechCrunch, that's a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How dare they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever they put a blog in there for.  The Daily Beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen and others complained about Twitter's selected users  list.  Right.  And this is Google's equivalent.  And I think that's dangerous.  It maintains an old hierarchy rather than enabling a new one to emerge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With you on that.  And I think Clint might be right that they haven't thought it out that much.  This is just something they threw out there.  It's just a lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the thing is they launched it at TechCrunch 50.  And a lot of people were paying attention to that.  So it picked up a lot of buzz right along with Bing Visual Search.  Those are the two biggest announcements out of the show.  So a lot of people picked up on that.  It got a lot of coverage.  And when things get a lot of coverage, people tend to attach more import to the things that  are being launched.  So I think that's what you saw there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really do like the Bing Visual Search.  I think that's kind of cool.  Because it just looks so much like it's out of the matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's Silverlight in action.  That's the Silverlight plugin for you there.  The first while flash killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've got digital cameras and then I can narrow it by the number of megapixels with  a slider.  And then it kind of rearranges itself.  And then I could say, oh, but I want a better optical zoom.  I mean, it's a demo.  But it's a cool demo.  It's a fun demo.  Like it.  All right.  There's a freebie.  That'll be your pick, Clint.  Okay.  Now, do you want to take off, Jeff?  Or we have some time to listen to quite a few.  I won't play them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus they're going to complain about me plugging my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not a one of them.  Not a one of them.  You know, one of the nice things that Gina mentioned a couple of weeks ago is that Gmail  now has a player in it for Google voice messages.  This is what I'm going to use.  And it works really nicely.  It's a great way to kind of when you have a big full mailbox review.  So again, our Google voicemail number is 9795 twigvm.  Let's listen to some of the voicemails that we got from people.  Quite a few of them.  And any comments you have, just let me know after we hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Leo.  My name is Daniel Horton.  I'm in Huntsville, Alabama.  Hey, listen, I'm loving this week in Google.  You guys are doing an awesome job.  I have a question for you guys related to Google services for businesses and universities.  I'm a web and graphic designer at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  And some of our administration has looked into getting Gmail and Google Docs and some  of the other services from Google as a service for our faculty and students.  However, the trick is some of us in tech positions at the university have had a hard time detailing  why this is so beneficial for everyone as opposed to the kind of archaic stuff that  we've been using for over 10 years now.  Some of those who've had objections to Google services have cited that Google would have  access to sensitive information within our university.  Sometimes we deal with research projects with government contracts and a lot.  Some others have also unfortunately cited the fact that Gmail was down for a little  while a couple of weeks ago.  So my question for you guys is what would you point out to those people in the administration  who are having these concerns?  How can we address those concerns about privacy and uptime?  Thanks again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People who are switching to Google Docs and I know a lot of universities are starting  to use Google Mail.  Gina is there a response to that?  Is it possible to be private and secure with Google Mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, the privacy issue is a good question.  I know especially with like state universities, you know, email.  Do you have me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're coming and going.  You're coming and going.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  That's silly Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll bear with it.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say that the privacy question is a tough one, especially with like universities  often email as a matter of public record.  But there's also private, private information, sensitive information.  I think the best thing to do is evaluating whether or not it's the right choice is to  look at the Google apps for universities and corporations material and look at, you know,  look at the privacy policy.  I mean, the best way to convince people, if you want to convince people that Gmail is  a good choice is to tell them, you know, imagine having email without any space restrictions.  You know, imagine never getting that message that says your mailbox is full ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And imagine being able to get to your email from your phone, from your home computer, from  anywhere and not have to worry about, you know, Outlook's web interface or VPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's HTTPS, it's secure HTTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the evaluation process is definitely important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the in the transcription.  Exactly.  In the transcription, they transcribed administrators as Mr. Asians.  The faculty and students was transcribed as Freckley states.  And government contract came out as army contracts.  So that was pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see an audio capture coming soon.  Leo, just one more point.  In last week's list on FriendFeed, there was a link that I put in there about the five  million students with the number of the week last week who are now using Google apps.  There's also a map there at university.  So I suggest that our caller, as we say on radio, can go and find a lot of the administrators  there and find out their rationale.  Also note that Google last week, I think for the government 2.0 conference, released a  view of Google apps for government.  And part of what they're going to offer there is higher security.  People with clearance use it only be in the US and so on and so forth.  So they are moving to more mission critical, even government things.  And that link is also on the FriendFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are things they're going to have to address anyway from everybody if they're going  to make inroads into those areas that they want to be in, like government, like universities.  Here's another caller from South Africa.  Hi, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is Andre from South Africa.  I'm listening in the traffic on the way back from the tech call listening to your quick  podcast preaching from South Africa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a hello from South Africa.  And here's one from Australia.  Hi, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Andrew Neaver here calling from Australia.  I just want to leave the voice message on your Google voice service.  Sorry, Leo, you're talking as I speak.  Just going to pause you.  Just want to say I have been a big fan of your show for a number of years and I am one  that pays not two, but $5 a month for the show.  It's the change for entertainment that you give me every day of the week.  It's not a wall.  It's a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a wall, is it?  I rely on you for my daily trip to the office.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice calls.  Again, it's 9795 twig VM.  Here's one for you, Gina.  Hello, twig crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a quick question about Google voice.  I wanted to know if Google voice is treated as a mobile number or is it treated as a landline  number?  For instance, if I'm calling on my cell phone and my cell phone plan has free mobile to  mobile calls, how is that treated by the carrier?  Just wondering if you had an answer to that.  Have a great day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a landline, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question actually.  When you make a phone call on Google voice, it calls a Google internal number and I think  that it is a landline.  I believe that that is a landline, but I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be very surprised if carriers treated that as part of your mobile to mobile minutes.  That's the last thing they wanted to do.  I'm going to get one more in here.  Let me see.  Got so many good ones and I had one I wanted to put aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should have the call from farthest with best accent contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've got two good ones from South Africa and Australia so far.  Please do.  That's one of the beauties of this is you can do it from anywhere.  I can't find the one I was going to play, but he mentioned that we were asking for Google  voice invites and he said, I don't know if I should say this, but you can buy them on  eBay for two bucks.  There are people there.  I tried it and you know what?  I got seven invites.  Caution.  Nice.  Yeah, but there's a caution.  You can't use the same phone number twice or the same Gmail address twice.  They really try to limit.  It looks like they're trying to limit you to one.  So you have to create a new Gmail address for every one you want to use and you have  to find friends with cell phones that will allow you to attach your Google voice to their  cell phone.  I ran out of numbers.  I have seven invites, but I don't have seven phone lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you did Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's all virtual.  What I figured out finally is you can assign it to one and then revoke it and you'll still  have the account, but you just won't have it attached to any phone line.  So there's a little tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one other Google voice tip.  I think last week Adam described that you can have Google voice SMS messages forwarded  to your email, which is great.  But if you also have a cell phone and you don't want your text messages forwarded to  your cell phone, I think a caller that Leo played before we started taping was asking  about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah.  If you go into Google voice settings under phones where your cell phone is listed, if  you hit the edit button, there is a checkbox that says receive SMS on this phone.  If you uncheck that box, your Google voice SMS messages do not get forwarded to your  phone, which is a really good way to save money on your text messaging.  If you SMS a lot and they'll still show up in your email and they'll still show up in  your email.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great tip.  Thank you for answering that.  Yeah, I was trying to find that one.  I have so many in this inbox.  I have to go through them.  Hey, what a great show.  Thank you so much, Clint Bolton, for joining us.  We really appreciate it.  Clint's column is GoogleWatch at googlewatch.eweek.com.  And we hope to have you back soon, Clint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great.  It was great being on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  Really nice to have you.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is back, baby.  Five holes or not, he's operating, well, at least his brain is operating at 100%.  Morphine does.  You're not on morphine, are you?  Little Vicodin, perhaps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can sell some on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, now, now, you know, I found frozen peas make a wonderful ice bag that will conform  to almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to know how you learned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost any shape.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great to have you back at buzz machine dot com.  Jeff proves that there is life after people magazine.  So we're glad to have him on board.  And of course, the great Gina Tripani, founder of Lifehacker, still a regular columnist there.  And I saw it, the Harvard Business Review.
