Are you JFK LaGuardia? Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm at Miami Airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Miami Airport, Jeff Jarvis. And where are you flying, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back home to Newark, as you can hear from above. I'll put it on mute now.  They're telling me what the time is. So useful.  Oh, it's three o'clock. You know where your flight is.  That's how late your flight is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I thought you were on Howard Stern this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was on Monday. I was down here to speak to Gucci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To Gucci, the handbag manufacturer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I was hoping to leave with some nice loafers, but didn't.  All right. That's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on Stern on Monday. We can talk about that in a few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to.  I also spent a few hours with IBM about Lotus Notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, cool. That was your punishment, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. The price I paid for fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The price he paid. Also with us, always glad to have her,  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  Howdy.  Howdy. And you're now working on, what is it,  Anil Dash's enterprise, Expert Labs, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Expert Labs, yeah. I'm working at Expert Labs and I'm writing for Fast Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congratulations, by the way. One of the most influential women in tech.  She's in the evangelist column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well deserved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I'd put you in the evangelist column, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was surprised by that too, but I'll take it. Hey, it's a great list of some smart ladies.  I'm very honored to be on it.  But I guess I think that this counts as my evangelizing. Twig does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're really a developer. I don't know if there was a developer category.  I don't see you as an evangelist for anything in particular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. A lot of people told me they bought a Nexus One because of me.  Oh, maybe you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've joined Gina's religion.  By any chance, you were already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Saint Gina.  Saint Gina of the Holy Android.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, I'm a recovering Catholic. Please, please stop saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our lady of open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here, we're really glad to have him. He's the host of our Windows Weekly Program,  the editor in chief of the SuperSite for Windows, winsupersite.com,  and news editor for Windows IT Pro, the author of Windows 7 Secrets, Mr. Paul Thurrott.  Hey, Paul.  Hello. How are you doing?  Thanks for joining us. We weren't sure if we were going to get Jeff in Miami,  so we brought Paul in to back us up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just going to play video games until you need me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, we need you.  Because you know what prompted me is I got an email from somebody saying,  well, I guess This Week in Google isn't really a cloud computing show  because you don't ever cover Microsoft's cloud initiatives.  It is This Week in Google.  Well, we almost call it This Week in Cloud Computing or This Week in the Cloud,  but we thought...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twig doesn't sound as good as twig, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  So...  Hey, can I derail this for one second?  Would you please?  There's a big Palm announcement coming up at 5 o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Must be a sale, right?  No, I didn't hear about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this a sale?  I'm not sure if this is public yet.  Tell us. Scoop it.  I'm not sure if I can.  How do you know about it?  I got an email about it from the company that is announcing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not Palm?  I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many syllables?  I'm not sure.  There's no accompanying...  You know, it doesn't say, hey, you can't talk about this, but I'm not sure if I should...  Charades!  It doesn't say embargo.  You can say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just...  Let me look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let me think.  Okay, so this is going to be an announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you buy a stolen phone from them?  Yeah, really?  No, I did not.  What is your guess?  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to pull a Gawker meteor.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see Gawker media's lawyer's line is that they didn't buy the phone, they bought the  story.  Yeah, let's make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They bought the story, the phone just came with it.  We were just...  It's your happy meal.  In fact, they said something even worse.  We took the phone so we could return it to Apple.  We bought the story...  That's so nicked at.  Yeah.  That's parsing it.  So do you think...  Okay, so obviously somebody bought Palm.  I'm thinking HP.  That's a good guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so he doesn't know if he can say it, but that's really interesting.  What would HP want?  It must be the patents.  Unless HP is going to get in the phone business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does HP do the...  HP already makes phones, yeah.  They make Microsoft phones.  They do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Along with Dell now.  Or at least they used to.  They used to, yeah.  It has been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they do.  They still do.  They do.  Yeah, in fact, they still use that IPAC brand.  They still make IP...  Oh, that's the old Compec.  Yeah, they still use the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  So it must be a pure business phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm not...  Anybody searching...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the existing phone.  Yes, Leo.  That phone is a...  That's a pure business phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's running Windows Mobile 6.5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet it is not.  It's pretty old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Glisten.  HP Glisten.  That is just a terrible name.  I'm sorry.  But it looks like a Blackberry phone, I have to say.  The Glisten.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That could be a Palm phone.  I could see them putting WebOS on there.  Could this be the kind of...  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they're going to go with the existing devices and so forth.  Anyway, sorry about that.  I got a little spaz attack there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can say it now, and Gadget has published a story, HP buys Palm.  They don't believe in embargoes.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't say anything about embargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy, holy, holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HP has announced it's acquiring Palm too.  You want to guess a number, Jeff Jarvis?  You're the number guy.  $1.2 billion.  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $1.2 billion, which works out to $5.70 a share.  The deal closes July 31st, which marks the end of HP's third fiscal quarter.  Current Palm CEO John Rubinstein is expected to remain with the company.  Press release just came out.  It did.  More details at 5pm.  And Paul, you scooped it.  That's great.  We practically beat in Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this.  I love this Wednesday schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually have news.  That's happening as we talk.  It's real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The chat room says, we told you about this 20 minutes ago.  Losers.  If you would just read the chat room, Leo, you would know everything.  All right, all right, all right.  I'm trying to do a show here.  Do you mind?  I do look at the chat room.  So by the way, this is not the only acquisition that broke today.  Apple has announced that it's buying Siri, which is a Apple iPhone app that's quite  impressive.  It's a voice app, voice enabled app.  But you could do things like make me a dinner date or get me tickets to the show.  It understands it does a search.  Siri apparently has an API that some sites work with.  And if it works with those sites, then Siri will act as almost a personal assistant.  It's a very interesting acquisition for Apple.  This is the day to spend money.  Did Google buy anything today?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shocking.  So Siri is an iPhone app?  Yeah.  And they bought it?  They bought it.  What's the state of voice input on the iPhone right now?  It's not as far along as Android.  There isn't a microphone on every...  You don't get the transcription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a Dragon dictate on the iPhone.  You don't get the same thing you get with Android 2.1 where you have every time you  see a keyboard you could dictate.  No.  But Google, of course, has its app on the iPhone.  And so all the Google app, that Google search stuff is all there, voice search stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Siri is only 3GS, right?  An iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably that's the case.  Yeah.  Let me look here.  It says, remember Siri's confirmed an interview with PC Magazine.  They filed with the FTC for an early termination request.  That is, I guess, to fast track regulatory approval.  Siri launched in February.  I mean, it's a pretty new product.  It's a natural language iPhone app.  You type or speak into the phone with a natural language request such as, book me a table  at 7.30 tonight for two at Ilfernaio or find out where Avatar is playing in 3D near my  office.  If I had an iPhone here, which I do not, I would show you.  It's actually really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the first app, like iPhone app, that Apple has purchased from a third party that  we know of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this is like a Twitter moment, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is kind of like a Twitter moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Altimeters Michael Gartenberg, an analyst, he says he believes Apple will  tightly integrate Siri and that the deal erased the advantage Google's Android offers with  its tightly coupled search.  That makes sense.  Be interesting.  If you put it everywhere in iPhone 4, then you absolutely have parity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because that is one of the things, right, that Android offers just voice to text everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of the things when people ask me, why do you use Nexus One?  It's the most the first thing I say is because I can dictate SMS.  I could dictate anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Or is this more against local and Foursquare and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has that application as well.  I mean, it's natural language.  It's location based.  It's very smart.  Siri is quite impressive.  People like Robert Scoble have said many times, this is a game changer, Siri.  Interesting acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The local stuff, is it using APIs or is it doing all the local stuff itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's my understanding that it's not doing scraping.  It might be doing some scraping, but that in most cases it works best if it's talking  a site like 777film or whatever that understands a Siri request and will hand it back the right  information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So for instance, Opal table works very well with.  So if you do a dinner reservation, Opal table and Siri have a language that they can talk  back and forth on.  I love it.  It works really well.  And it's also a beautiful UI.  It's a very intriguing UI that kind of takes something that's pretty difficult to understand  and use and makes it fairly simple by giving you a lot of examples and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on the iPad too, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I should probably be saying I could show it on the iPad, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to remind you of your toy.  I have this.  It's just integrated into my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Paul's going to hate me in a minute.  Paul's are, no, I'm sorry.  He's playing Modern Warfare 2.  We're safe.  Paul, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, I was writing up a little blog post about this HP thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead.  Please do that.  It's a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's breaking.  You're still making cat sounds on your iPad?  Did I miss something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You missed nothing.  You know, this is a good question.  Do I have Siri on here?  I don't.  I think I took it off, so I will install it right now.  Because I took off a lot of non-native iPad apps because I just don't like that little  interface.  But I'll put Siri on here and we can play with it.  Meanwhile, other stories in the Google verse.  Gina, you said there are a lot of small stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are a couple of small stories.  They launched Google Earth integration with Google Maps this week.  So there's a browser plugin that you install, Mac or Windows, and you get Google Earth views  in Google Maps.  It's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you do, so how is that different from the satellite view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got that Google Earth feeling to it.  Actually, that's a really good question.  It's similar to the satellite view.  Does it support KML?  That also is a good question.  So you go to earth.google.com slash plugin.  You can install the plugin and let's see.  Oh, they've got a couple of cool little demos here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's take a look.  It's a web browser plugin lets you navigate and explore.  Oh, I see.  There is a big difference there because you have that 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the 3D building experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very cool.  A lot of people have used Google SketchUp to design.  You go to New York City now, almost all the buildings are 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  So when you have the plugin installed, you get a little button on the upper right-hand  side.  There's like map satellite and then there's an Earth option, which is pretty neat.  It's just kind of like the Google Earth experience in maps with that 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Works on Chrome, IE7, Firefox and Flock on Windows.  Does not work on Chrome on OS X, just Safari and Firefox on OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can do that thing.  You can pan kind of, if you hold down the shift key and click and drag, you can pan  kind of like horizontally.  I'm not describing that one.  You can change the angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that with Street View though too, can't you now?  I can't remember.  It's all merging together into one big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me show you real quickly.  I can show you Siri because I've installed it now on the iPad.  So there it is.  Unfortunately, you can see this is why I took it off in the first place.  It does ask immediately if it can use your location data.  I think I'll have to log into my Siri account, so I'll show you some more of that in a second.  Let's see.  Hi, I'm Siri, your new personal assistant.  Please tap to get started.  Just a sec.  So you do have an account, an online account.  Or they verify, I guess they verify your...  I remember this took a little while before.  Maybe they save your information in the cloud.  It's so funny typing on this giant keyboard, this giant iPhone keyboard on an iPad.  It's just, you feel like you're in Toy Town.  Oh, it's already registered.  Yes, this is my address.  Okay, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First we're going to talk about why you uninstalled me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the attributes of natural language is I have feelings.  You hurt my feelings badly when you took me off your iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I guess I have to do this whole thing to reset my password.  We'll worry about this later.  But it's a really cool app.  You can see that it's doing some really interesting UI stuff that is not typically Apple kind  of UI stuff.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you raise an important point.  Is Apple now going to start buying apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know what time it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to know that local time is 430.  Why do they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do they do that?  People wear watches.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just interesting to me that they bought an iPhone app.  Very interesting.  I mean, it kind of gives a goal.  iPhone app developers can have a new goal.  Apple acquired.  Right.  Let's get bought out by Apple.  Exactly.  I'm playing around with this Google Earth in Maps and it's really cool.  It does that thing where Earth zooms out and you see the whole planet and then it kind  of rotates around to the place you want to go.  I went from Brooklyn to San Francisco and you have the full rich Earth experience in  Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and it's in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in the browser.  But you do need that extra plug-in, which is just this extra step, installation step.  The other neat geo thing that came out is an Android Sky map, which is an Android app  that you kind of, and I think there's something like this available for the iPhone as well.  You launch the app and you kind of point it up to the sky and it shows you the constellations  as you move based on your location, which is pretty neat.  And mobile Firefox, Fennec, is available pre-alpha for Android right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that going to be better than the built-in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, it is definitely not.  It's a huge download and it crashes on my Nexus One.  It's very, very pre-alpha.  It's like pre-nightly build even.  But it's kind of neat to see.  I have some nostalgic feelings about Firefox.  I love Firefox even though Chrome is getting to be increasingly the more attractive choice  because it's just so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chrome is getting better.  But of course, we don't have all the plug-ins.  That is one reason Chrome is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, which browser do you guys use full-time right now?  Chrome or Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chrome here.  Paul, are you a Chrome guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I am a Chrome guy.  Yeah.  It's just so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so speedy.  And Firefox is just…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I used Firefox for years, but this is no comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just gotten…  It's turned into a pig.  A little bloaty.  Yeah.  A little bloaty.  And partly, I think that's kind of doing it a little bit of a disservice because it's  all the plug-ins that we use that make it bloaty.  Okay.  So here we go.  So now this is Google Maps in the browser with the plug-in installed.  And so what's going to happen here is what?  I mean, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's definitely more Google Earthy, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  It's super 3D.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it integrate well with Street View?  Boy, I don't know.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't look like the Street View Pegman.  Usually, you see the yellow Pegman.  He doesn't seem to even be an option.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  So you have the…  It just adds tabs.  You have the map.  You've got satellite.  And now I have an Earth tab.  And it did kind of look the same, but notice it did a little angling thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hold down the shift key and click and drag and you can change your angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  That's the Google Earth.  Now, if I were actually somewhere where people had mapped buildings…  The yaw is going off.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Titanic is listed as a location on the left side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's go to the Titanic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't even know.  Oh, this is the underwater stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So funny.  Yeah.  Titanic ditch, Colorado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Titanic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  I mean, you're getting the Titanic on your left side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got the Matterhorn.  Oh, it's random.  I see.  It's random.  Yeah.  Gateway Arch, Hoover Dam, CN Tower, Niagara Falls, Coliseum, Titanic, Atlantic Ocean.  Let's go.  We're going to go visit the Titanic, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so it does that zoom out and then zooms you in.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Going underwater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope you got your aqualung on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, look.  Wow, there's two halves.  That is amazing.  Okay.  That's pretty neat.  That is freaking cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I zoom in on it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I guess I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Can I go in the windows?  Wow.  That's kind of eerie.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, and it's kind of brown and split in half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's neat to just click on a place and zoom out and fly over to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be a great way, Jeff, instead of sitting in the Miami airport?  Just click and go.  I can imagine I'm home.  Just go.  Click and go.  Here's the Tower Bridge in London.  Yeah, that's it.  I think this is a nice addition.  Here's a 3D.  Somebody's done SketchUp, a 3D of the Tower Bridge, so it's like a pop-up.  It's very slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun.  All the time that I've wasted in Google Earth, I could avoid it because I had to launch a  whole other program, but now I can just waste time flying around the globe right in my browser.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another way to kill time.  Thank you, Google.  What would we ever have done without the Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So while we're on Maps, they've gone nutty in Germany again on Street View.  One city in Germany is not only are they requiring that they hash out faces and license plates  on public streets, but also they want to put up public notices before they get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're coming to your town.  We're going to take pictures.  Just beware if you want to stay out of...  Hide.  Hide, Joseph.  Take Grandma inside.  Yeah, she said not be seen.  Well, talking about privacy, Gina, you wrote an excellent article.  In fact, an article I've been sending to people, Time to Audit Your Facebook Privacy Settings.  Here's how.  This is a Fast Company article by Gina Trapani.  Was it difficult for you to figure out what to set and what not to set?  I mean, the big issue is, and you point this out, when you go to Yelp or Pandora or docs.com,  you get this bar at the top that says, hey, Gina, Yelp is using Facebook to personalize  your experience.  And you have to click no thanks to opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's opt out versus opt in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But worse than that, because your friends can still reveal information about you.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had this interesting experience this week.  So I'm friends on Facebook, friends with my nephew who's 14 or so.  And he liked a friend of his status updates, a friend who I don't have access to.  But because my nephew liked it, I could see that status update.  And this whole conversation between all these like 13 to 15 year old boys and girls,  which I was certainly not meant to see.  Clearly, this was not meant for an adult to see.  And it was because his friend had never changed the default setting, which is that my friends,  even if my profile, parts of my profile are set to friends only access, my friends can share  certain things like photos, like status updates.  So and that's the default.  Even if you set your profile to private, there's still this other privacy settings panel  that you have to go in and say, my friends can't share information about me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it says, are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Allowing instant personalization will give you a richer experience as you browse the web.  If you opt out, you will have to manually activate these experiences.  Please keep in mind, if you opt out, your friends may still share public Facebook information about you.  At least they tell you this.  And then you have to go and check it again and say block it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And that's easy now because there's only three of them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what if there's a thousand of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the thing.  As Facebook adds more partners, you either have to opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Each one individually or is there a global opt out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There isn't a global opt out.  Each one individually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I used your global, you did recommend a global opt out solution and I did.  Did you really?  I have deactivated my Facebook account.  And what I did on, you know, by the way, deactivating is kind of, it's not very committed  because all you have to do is log back in with your password and it suddenly comes alive again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Well, that's what's so interesting, right?  They make it difficult for you to just close your account.  It's not just closing your account and everything's gone.  You're deactivating it where they'll just hold on to all your data for you just in case you change your mind.  You might change your mind.  And then there's like full on delete and there's two, then those, and there are two different places to do those things.  So I just, I feel like Facebook goes out of its way to make things confusing and hard to find so that it like forces the defaults on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the guilt trip they lay on you when you deactivate.  Have you deactivated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So right.  When you hit deactivate, it shows you pictures of all your friends' faces saying like Leo's going to miss you.  They're going to miss you.  Adam's going to miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was appalled. It was like, you don't want to quit.  It made me want to quit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like trying to leave AOL in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right? Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, and I have to say this is not an easy decision.  And one of the reasons I didn't delete, but I deactivated and I said, my last status update on both my private and personal face  by private and public Facebook account was I am deactivating my account pending until I understand what the privacy implications of all this are.  I'm I'm deactivating my account.  But and so it's kind of nice that I don't have to delete everything, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really thinking after our last show, Leo, I blogged that if you can't figure this out, you know, how can anybody figure it out?  It's really complex.  And it struck me that what I want to remember the old Seinfeld bizarro episode, what I want is a bizarro version of this where I hold identity stuff.  I publish it and I get I give permission to Facebook to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called opt in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's called opt in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the reverse. It's that I'm the host of my identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yes, that's right.  I store it and I give you permission.  Facebook is saying, yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.  You store it with us.  Of course, we have access to it.  And then you give other sites permission to act access what we know about you.  That's what's going on with Pandora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know what there's a site I can't find right now that I got.  There was a Twitter like Timmy.  You know where Facebook is touching you?  And it was a little thing that would show you what Facebook shows the world.  It's awkward because you have to click on every single possible file and link.  I'll try to find it to put on the on the friend feed later.  But it's interesting.  We need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's zesty.ca slash Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The amazing St. Gina.  That's a great site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I love that.  You shall find.  So here it is.  Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?  Justine will miss you.  Rodrigo will miss you.  Nick will miss you.  Gary will miss you.  Tony will miss you.  They'll no longer be able to keep in touch with you.  It's as if if you leave Facebook, you don't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep this account or we'll kill this dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then after you say I have a privacy concern, it says, please remember, you can always control the information you share and you can see it before you deactivate.  Please take a moment to learn more about how privacy works on Facebook.  It's marmy.  And then this is other thing.  Even after you deactivate, your friends can still invite you to events, tag you in photos or ask you to join groups.  If you opt out, you will not receive.  So in other words, I've deactivated.  But still, I live on on Facebook.  I still have an account in effect until I delete that account.  But I don't want to get emails.  I don't want to know what they're doing with my my image and so forth.  So and then you have to confirm your password.  The best thing to do at this point would be to change it to something I don't know.  Then you have to do this.  Like we don't want a robot to deactivate you.  So you have to do a capture.  What the hell word is that?  You're uranium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uranium. Really?  U R A N I U M.  Yes, it is uranium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geez, thank you.  I needed some help.  Crowdsourced the capture.  And now, by the way, it's going to think for a really long time because I have five thousand friends and it actually took like an hour.  It's ridiculous.  So Zesty.ca

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slash Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's also a great new post on Lifehacker as long as we're talking about this.  But what Facebook publicly publishes about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the site that goes to this site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So OK, so the Lifehacker site is going to this site.  So any information you see below is visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you put in you, it probably won't work because you're now not visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Oh, I hope so.  Well, let's find out.  So do I enter it?  Where do I enter it here?  Yeah. OK.  Yeah.  That's the now as a public person.  Oh, good. Data empty.  I love that.  That's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm putting my name in there.  Are you still active?  You can put me and Leo.  I am still active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is it with a space?  Gina Trapani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, just just just one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Name.  So what do I click one of these?  Oh, yeah.  Look at all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, baby.  Look at that.  So I don't know what to do.  Now, this is a connection.  So these are some activities.  So this just goes.  This is using the API to get this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Exactly.  Oh, calls to stream is exceeded the rate of 100.  Everybody's doing that right now.  Everyone's doing it right now.  Yeah.  Let's also say, Regina, the apps.  We broke it.  We broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's copying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shouldn't Facebook provide just that?  Facebook should say should be if Facebook wants to be the guardian of our identity,  then they should be the guardian of our identity and act that way, not as the sleazy sleazy  little strong smarmy, you know, like direct auto salesmen, which is what they're acting  like now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do have that like view your profile as this person would see it button at some point  in the profile editing process.  So I give them that so you can see what other people would see.  But the thing is, is that I was talking to a friend of mine about this is like all of  us geeks who are concerned about privacy and know what the implications are like, we're  going to go through all those privacy panel settings and check up about but, you know,  15 year old young kids aren't going to are just going to, you know, stick with the defaults  and just keep chatting with their friends, you know, defaults matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two responsibilities there.  One is the default and understanding that.  And the second is I think that there's an opportunity for Facebook to say we're going  to help you with your identity throughout the web.  But now I don't trust them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think about all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been this is a tough one for me because I use Facebook.  My family's on Facebook.  I like you guys.  I feel like they're they're not doing enough.  In fact, I think they are actively working to make it hard to configure things like privacy.  I cannot believe the controls that are in there.  And even I have struggled with them.  And as you guys were going through the site, I was using the same thing looking at mine.  And, you know, I'm pretty transparent about my myself.  But, you know, my wife's on there, my kids on there.  I just forwarded that link to my wife to say, let's make sure everyone's on the on the right page here.  But do you think it'll be a backlash?  Yeah, I hope so.  I mean, you know, because increasingly this is the way that people get in touch with other people.  I mean, I had dinner with college friends of mine.  I haven't seen it over 20 years because of Facebook.  So I recognize the value.  But yeah, I mean, it's scary and it and it's confusing.  I mean, to me, it's confusing.  I went in, I was just looking at my Facebook settings once again.  And I find myself instantly bewildered to the point where I don't even want to look at it.  It's so confusing.  I just think they do a bad job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, here's a cynical question.  Do you think that that's intentional or do you think that the push to give so much control led them down there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a maturity.  You know, I think it's just an immature service from young guys that don't have a lot of industry background.  I'm more cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they know exactly what they're doing.  I liken this to Apple.  Apple does what it does and can have very much the same way.  And they have two justifications.  If you know, we're doing this to make it convenient for you.  It really makes the web more friendly place.  All these connections are valuable.  And that is true.  But it also has this huge benefit to us.  And I think Apple's done a very good job of saying we're going to do what's good for us.  But here's why it's good for you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I went to spend time with these guys from IBM and Lotus, which is my price for getting on the Howard Stern show,  what struck me was that they did all the integration with all these Internet things that we want.  To do that, they had to basically recreate the Internet and all its applications.  But what impressed me was you really do get over your identity, who sees it, in what way, and so on.  And it made me wishful for how that should work on the Internet and doesn't now because we have these folks who are trying to,  you know, scam us, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How was that, by the way, doing Howard Stern? Was that fun?  You'd never been in the studio. You've been on Howard many, many, many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been on the phone a lot. I've never been in the studio.  And I was in the studio and he asked me what I was up to next.  And I said a book about privacy, I hope.  And then we got into it. And suddenly next, I knew I was on the story of prostate cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were telling about you were revealing too much.  But, you know, I think it's really good if somebody...  See, here's an opportunity, Jeff, because if somebody like Howard Stern starts saying,  Facebook's gone too far, that carries so much more weight than if we say it.  People listen to him. Teenagers listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a weird thing in the tech industry too about sour grapes.  I mean, I'm a Microsoft guy, Gene is a Google person.  I mean, so we're complaining about Facebook. You're an Apple guy, right?  I mean, unfortunately, people tend to see us in the scope of that.  So obviously, of course we hate Facebook because we want this other thing to win,  you know, whatever that might be. And that's not the case at all.  I use Facebook and like I said, I recognize the value, but I am a little freaked by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I think part of the issue with Facebook too is that it started out as a service that was by default,  everything was private, right? You had to have a college, you know, a .edu email address.  You had to sign in to see anything. I mean, it was mostly everything was private.  And then it became then more information became public. And that's wrong.  I mean, so nothing's wrong. It's just that's the way that you freak out users.  You can't start with the, you know, with things being private and then make them public unless they change settings.  If you offer a service from which everything is public and then you can opt to make that stuff private, it's a different story.  It's kind of like how you can lower prices and not upset people, but you can't raise them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, well, Facebook's got a difficult challenge. This is the narrative as I see it.  So, you know, this young guy, Mark Zuckerberg, basically wants to get laid.  So he's in college. He's a college sophomore and he can't meet girls because he's a nerd.  So he creates the Facebook, which is essentially a site where he hopes he can get, you know,  Harvard girls to enter information on so he can Mac on them.  And you know what? It's viral. It goes viral. Why does it go viral?  Because everybody wants to put their information on there so they can Mac on each other. They're college kids.  So he suddenly gets this notion. He suddenly realizes, wait a minute, this is hugely valuable.  By the way, I didn't get it until I really kind of thought about it.  He's created a platform where I am incented to give them all, you know, just a bear all.  And I get a payout. If you're a college kid, I get a payout.  Now, even we as adults, we found there's a payout because we meet old friends.  We couldn't connect with them. There's these huge payouts.  So there's an exchange going on. I give them all my information.  Facebook says, now we'll only reveal it to those people you say you want it revealed to.  OK, I feel comfortable then. It's not, you know, super private, but at least, you know, I have some control over it.  And I get this great payout.  But now Facebook says, oh, wow, look at this. We got all this great information.  This is this is a gold mine if we could just give this to advertisers.  So they kind of give it to advertisers. Exactly.  We'll give it to third party marketers. We'll protect it.  But we'll give it because there's because there's gold at the end of that rainbow.  And now all of a sudden, Facebook saying, holy cow, we have a big this is a huge gold mine.  And the more that we can get, the more we can sell.  That's where they come up with Beacon. They get shut down a little bit.  OK, OK, we'll back off.  Now they say, well, what about Open Graph? Now we get everybody not even.  You know, now we got everybody on Facebook.  How do we get them to give us more information about where they go, what they like, what they search for?  Look at Google. They're getting all this great search.  How can we get that stuff?  And they come up with Open Graph, which is just another way to pipe your information into Facebook so they can give it to marketers.  I think it all makes perfect sense. Is that narrative seem seem like what's even more than Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's right. And I also think that we see, you know, Google causes four billion clicks a month to publishers bit.  Lee, two billion Facebook. God knows how many I think we see that the human link becomes more powerful soon than search.  And it really is a win against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Google somehow better than Facebook in this regard?  I don't know why I trust Google more. I mean, but doesn't seem like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what about Google Buzz? You know, Buzz made a screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Buzz made a screw up. It wasn't of the same nature.  It wasn't to me. Everything Facebook does is a cynical attempt to get more of my information so they can sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Buzz, you know, went head over heels to try to fix it in the weekend, realizing, oops, we mix the public and the private.  That was a mistake. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Google's business model somehow inherently more less intrusive, though?  I mean, they're not. I don't give them information willingly.  I mean, they they kind of follow me around in my searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In all this discussion, I was tweeting about it and blogging about it after our last talk.  And Rick Clow, who's a very good guy at Google, is now in charge of Google profiles.  And he's been talking a little bit. He's trying to get his head around it.  I think more about being what we want it to be, which is an open thing where we can publish it anywhere.  I think that Google's mission is to organize the world's information.  Facebook should have been to help us organize ourselves.  It's trying to organize us. I think the difference is information versus lives.  Facebook is in our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google was dealing primarily with public information.  When you put up a public web page, you know, you wanted to thank Google when they index it and send people your way, you know,  by putting it in their search results. I'm like, hey, thanks. That's that helps me and also makes me money.  With Facebook, when Facebook makes my information public in way backdoor ways that I wasn't aware of because the defaults changed,  I feel really violated. It's a completely different thing.  But Google started out dealing with the public web and they mostly do deal with the public web except for Gmail and,  you know, your contacts and your reader and docs.  And so far, except with the exception of Buzz, the notable exception of Buzz, they haven't screwed that up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very it's really great. We got to take a break. It's a really interesting story.  Paul Thurad is here from Windows Weekly podcast.  He's also the guy behind the SuperSight for WindowsWindsSuperSight.com, the author of Windows 7 Secrets and an expert.  We haven't really talked much about Microsoft's cloud initiatives. I'd love to do that with you, Paul, in just a little bit.  Jeff Jarvis is at the airport, Miami Airport. I'm so glad we were able to get him on from the airport.  Are people giving you strange looks?  He's frozen in time. He's frozen.  Now we're giving him strange looks. Unless that's the universal signal for hi.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There he goes. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine.com. That's his blog, Gina Trapani, SmarterWear.org, founder of Lifehacker.  It's always great to have all three of you on board.  Briefly, let me talk a little bit about GoToTraining, and then we'll get back to our conversation about Google and the cloud.  GoToTraining is the latest product from Citrix. They are so fantastic.  They've got, of course, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, great remote access products.  Now they want to take on training and make training better.  If you've just done corporate training of any kind online, you probably know how bad the state is, how bad the state of the art is.  It's all changing now with GoToTraining, just launched from Citrix.  GoToTraining.com. You can try it free for 30 days.  Of course, you get all the great benefits of Citrix's base platform, screen sharing.  Your presenters can be in different locales anywhere in the world.  Great voice over IP, chat.  But there's some additional features that are just for training.  For instance, you can create a content library associated with your training, upload any document type or link to any website.  And that library can be used before, during and after your training sessions.  You can create and customize training tests to give attendees before, during or after each training session.  You can send out email invites to the session using the integrated email system.  Where are you? We're starting.  Integrated chat, polling features, feedback, testing, complete testing for the training.  And here's the best part now. So you can have up to 200 people at your event, at your live session.  And that's nice because you get some nice interactivity going and so forth.  And then record it as it's going and anybody can take that training anytime.  Man, I have to take this training for the radio show on how not to swear on it on the air.  And which, by the way, thank you, Howard Stern, because I wouldn't have to take this if it weren't for that massive FCC fine of Howard Stern.  And it's impossible.  It's designed for people in the building and I'm not in the building.  And it just I mean, I've been talking to the IT people.  Just use GoToTraining. I wish I could get the if you've had a bad training experience, if you're a trainer, if you're an IT professional, try it or get your training folks to try it.  Go to training dot com.  Thirty days free. It's all yours. Go to training dot com.  We're so glad to have them on this week in Google. Thank you, Citrix, for your support.  I mean, that's talk about cloud. Now, I think, Jeff, I don't know if he's gone off to take his plane in the cloud.  Oh, there he is. He came back.  There's Jeff Jarvis.  Are you there, Jeff? Oh, you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My sprint died, so I switched to Wi-Fi. If I get to be too unbearable in this way as well as others, just cut me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're always always bearable.  The always bearable. Anybody's ever said it.  The always bearable Jeff Jarvis.  So I don't know how valuable these stats are and you're very good, Paul Therode, at debunking stats like this.  I'll throw them out there. I don't know if this is your number, Jeff.  I don't have none, so do it.  Okay, good. Android passes the iPhone for web traffic in the US.  Now, this is based on AdMob, which publishes web ads in both Android and iPhone apps.  Now, there are a lot more web ads from AdMob, I think, in, well, I don't know.  They must be normalizing this for the number of applications and so forth.  Android traffic in the US has increased to 46% of OS share compared to 39% for iPhone.  Worldwide iPhone is still number one with 46% and Android only 25%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the installed base of each? Do we have numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Google doesn't reveal that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That Andy Rubin interview with the Times, I think he said that Android's 9% of smartphones in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. That was a very forthcoming interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a very forthcoming interview. Yeah, I'm just double checking. Pretty sure it was 9%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AdMob, by the way, even though Google bought it, is not yet part of Google. They don't have regulatory approval.  So, and of course, we know the installed base of iPhones is, because Apple's just said it in there, I think, was it 75 million?  Anyway, it's an interesting stat. Android is, I think nobody would doubt that Android is coming on strong.  Verizon announced this week that they are not going to carry the Nexus One phone,  even though this has been on Google's, you know, price list.  Coming in the spring, they said, no, you know what, we're going to stick with our Droid line, and in particular, the HTC Incredible, which is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Indeed, incredible. Don't you want it?  The New York Times says Android currently runs on 9% of smartphones in the United States, according to Comscore.  That's about right.  That AdMob number, I was confused about it. At first, I looked at it and said, this seems strange, right, at 9% smartphone usage.  But it's ad impressions in relation to the entire market share of the operating system. Is that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that just means that more Android users see ads than iPhone users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. It's ad impressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's ad impressions within the current market share.  So that's interesting in that it may make Android an attractive platform for advertisers to work on, but we still have to remember that we're talking about 9% of the market in the United States.  So that's a much smaller market than the iPhone.  Because I looked at the number and said, I don't understand. Are all these Android users tethering?  What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we using the web more because on Apple you're always on apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe more Android apps use AdMob because there are far more free apps on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  38,000 apps now in the App Store as of a few weeks ago. That was your number I think last week. 38,000.  That's pretty compelling. I mean, that's a big... that's huge growth. 8,000 in a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that is big growth. I got my Google I.O. Droid.  You did?  Yes, I did.  How do you like it?  I like it. It's okay. I like the Nexus one better.  Me too.  I think I'm actually going to try developing something for Android. I'm going to try and put together a little app.  Oh, good.  Using the Droid. So I'm excited about that. So no Tutu, but maybe when Google I.O. happens, I'm supposed to bring the phone to I.O.  Maybe they'll offer an update to the Tutu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we were speculating on that. Maybe that's when they would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am actually now it's 50,000 apps. Somebody just said. Is that right? Could that possibly be? Wow.  The latest. I guess that's what Andy Rubin said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. In that article he did say 50,000, didn't he?  50,000 apps. That's huge growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't want an incredible. I want an incredible. I'm very tempted to throw this Nexus one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, no, I do.  Eight megapixels.  Yeah, yeah. It's an incredible answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It replaces the track ball with optical. It is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is incredible. It's well named, although I don't know. The name is like, come on.  Obvious adjective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once you've gone to incredible, what is in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. There's nothing else to look forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You hit the end of the superlative line.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next word up is a curse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fucking unbelievable.  Leo, you got a little New York coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. This phone is an absolute unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the Inderdice clay over there.  That way you can get Diceman to do the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be? I'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be the greatest brand ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's unbelievable. This phone.  Everybody should want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I decided that if you all were going to ask me about the Gizmodo thing, that I was going to take out my Brooklyn accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So congratulations.  You got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You just stole an iPhone and are being investigated by the Santa Clara React team.  What are you going to do next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? What?  What? What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if Jason Chen says that, but he should.  He should. He should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we have an opinion on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we've talked incessantly about it since Twitter on Sunday.  And then on MacBreak Weekly, we had Denise Howley, attorney, come on.  You guys, you're Jeff, maybe, as a representative of the ink-stained, wretch class.  Are there shield laws in New York State?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. I think New York State does. No federal, of course.  And there was an Atlantic blog argument that this ruins journalism because it opens up the shield.  But hello, journalism has woken up everybody. You have to deal with this.  Basically, what would happen in an open world is that Tony Soprano would start a blog and say,  Hey, I'm a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so it's the HTC bada-bing.  What is this podcast about again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, Paul. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all up in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in the cloud. Our heads are in the clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Microsoft up to in the cloud?  I mean, look, they got the cloud guy.  You're talking about Lotus earlier, Jeff.  I mean, Ray Ozzie, who created Lotus Notes, has been working at Microsoft now for how many years?  Three or four years?  Yep.  And everybody thought, well, as soon as Ray Ozzie arrives, Microsoft's going cloud. Did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it did. But of course, because it's Microsoft, it's happened in such a stealth fashion.  It's like no one noticed.  To this day, Microsoft's biggest cloud services, such as they are, are the cloud services it's had for a long time.  The Windows Live stuff that used to be MSN, the Hotmail stuff.  I mean, that's still very popular and will, I'm sure, continue to be popular.  But obviously, they're trying to move their server products to the cloud through Windows Azure and the other Azure services.  They have hosted versions of Exchange and Communication Server and SharePoint and so forth that they're selling to businesses.  But it's a tough transition.  Microsoft obviously has made billions and billions on very traditional software and the world is changing.  So they're kind of scurrying to catch up in many ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was talking about live typing in Google Docs and in Wave with a Microsoft guy this week.  And he said, oh, well, you know, Microsoft has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've done that for years.  And I said, yeah, there's a lot like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he said, yeah, in the rich client, which I assume that he was talking about Microsoft Word being the rich client or on live.  If you're in the rich client, if you're hooked up over SharePoint correctly or on live, you can kind of watch people update a document at the same time.  I had no idea.  I mean, I feel like part of the issue with Microsoft's cloud stuff is like whenever a cloud announcement happens, I'm always just like, what does this mean?  Like, I'm not really sure.  I can't parse it like for an individual user.  And I feel like maybe it's because their launches are primarily for enterprise.  But I rarely get excited about it because I'm always like, oh, but I have to have an exchange server with SharePoint.  And I just don't work with a lot of corporations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not the only one who doesn't get excited about exchange.  Yeah.  Everybody hates exchange.  Don't worry about that.  It's hard to get excited about.  So rhetorically, I one time and I've asked this other times publicly, but I've asked Microsoft, you know, if Exchange Server is so great, why doesn't Hotmail run on it?  You know, a lot of stuff going on there.  But, you know, it's been long enough.  I mean, they bought Hotmail back in what 1994 or something like that.  If they were going to move it to Exchange, they would have done it a long time ago.  So clearly that's not happening.  It was on Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They moved enough Linux.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right.  To me, not to go back to this Lotus thing, but it's similar.  I ignore the enterprise world because I live out here in the onesies and twosies world of ours.  And there actually is stuff going on in the enterprise world, which I've always made fun of.  But they do have the opportunity to integrate in ways that we don't have because people are trying to grab on to standards like Facebook and Twitter and not make them standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they also have security controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So it almost seems that my eyes were open to this extent that there is potentially some development that can happen in the enterprise world that can get them past the web.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the criticisms of Ray Ozzie is that when he arrived at Microsoft, you know, he talked about stuff like LiveMesh or the Groove products that moved into Office.  And in many ways, it seems like he's been re-implementing the same kind of software solution over time at different places.  And of course, a lot of the Microsoft stuff has sat still for a few years now.  So there's some confusion going on there.  But I think this year is going to be a big one for the Windows Live stuff.  And it's worth noting too that Microsoft's consumer online services are actually used by several hundred million people.  And they are, in fact, more popular than the equivalent Google services or the Yahoo services or whatever in most cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talk about Docs all the time, but Docs is a fraction. Gmail is a fraction of Hotmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. Yeah, and actually I do have some numbers there.  These are from Microsoft. I'll take this with their grain of salt, if you will.  But according to Microsoft, and this is less than 30 days old, there are about 400 million people that use Hotmail every day.  175 million for Gmail and 200 million for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we make this big deal about 400 million Facebook users.  That's a month. There's 400 million Hotmail users a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Microsoft says that there are actually over 500 million active users of all of their Windows Live services every month.  And those are people that use email, instant messaging, the social networking stuff, and the portals.  Who the fuck? About a half a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who are these people? Are they primarily US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, so actually I don't actually have that data in front of me, but that's obviously worldwide.  But the Windows Live stuff tends to be very popular in the United States.  Curiously, there are countries in Europe where it's incredibly popular, and then a couple of countries in Asia.  And I don't know those off the top of my head, but I want to say it's something like France and Germany, countries like that, where the percentages are actually higher.  Really?  In whatever countries for whatever reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you were going to correct me, and I want to correct myself. It's free BSD, not Linux, that Hotmail was originally.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting the way you said that, who are these people?  No, but that's actually really interesting because nobody knows who these people are.  Well, because they're not advocates for the technology.  It's not us. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's a good reminder that I'm sealed in my nerd bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I see more people on Yawgmail than I ever see on Hotmail or on Microsoft Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. I mean, whatever it's worth.  Is it all spam accounts?  What's the hell?  400 million spammers?  I happen to use Gmail and Google Calendar and all that stuff myself right now.  I anticipate that changing over time, but part of the reason is that Microsoft hasn't gotten the integration pieces in that they need.  They have tremendous desktop software and server software and all that kind of stuff, and they have actually very decent online services as well.  But there are weird missing chunks of integration that are very important.  So, for example, their online calendar service doesn't integrate with any mobile phone right now.  That's not even their own.  Wow.  And not even their own. And that's right. Wow. I mean, that's ludicrous.  And it's worse than it sounds because this dates back a year now.  So we're waiting for this new generation of Windows Live services to hit when this will all be rectified.  And that's fantastic. But why wasn't this one thing fixed over the past year?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It signals a lack of commitment a little bit to me.  I'm like, well, they've got this whole business where they sell software that comes in boxes on shelves at Staples.  They're not going to worry about getting their live calendar down to their mobile phone.  Well, they should. How much longer are they going to be able to do that?  Is that the wrong way to look at it, Paul?  I mean, it concerns me.  This is Google's business, their whole business.  So I know that they're totally committed to this.  This is their only platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So Google, as a relatively young company, came of age on the Internet.  All of their services are essentially Internet-based.  They do have some traditional software products like Chrome and so forth.  But mostly they perceive the world from the Internet.  That's a huge advantage when you're talking about online services.  Microsoft sees the world from a traditional software sense, like you said, literally floppy disks and boxes.  Making that transition is hard because they made so much money doing it the old way.  There are still people at that company, I'm sure, who are thinking, what are we doing?  And you can look at things like Microsoft Office, where they move so slowly to the web, away from this old business model.  Office is still a very traditional software product.  But on the other hand, with this version, you can do things like buy Office online, literally digitally install it, stream it down to your computer.  It's still that traditional software, but they're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who here uses Office online or off versus Google Docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I literally just had to send a fax today for reasons I don't even want to get into.  But I wound up using Word and I was like, oh, I need a fax template.  And actually within Word, you're able to choose a template and auto download it.  So you're browsing the online gallery and then I chose the template that I wanted and auto download it.  And I was super impressed. I was like, oh, this is a really nice integration.  I had a nice fax template and used it.  I generally I use a text editor or Docs, but there are some editors who want to use Word.  If I want something to look really nice and format it well, I use Word.  That's the only time I've used Word.  I did it in Word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for books, publishers want Word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not concerned so much with formatting as I am with the functionality around spelling,  grammar checking and all that stuff.  But you raised another interesting point there because Word is a traditional software product.  One's been around for a long, long time, has picked up these kind of online capabilities over time.  Whereas a product like Google Docs is going to come at it from the internet point of view.  And it will pick up more traditional software type design features over time as well.  So they're going to meet in the middle at some point, right?  But right now they just approach the same thing from completely different points of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked on Windows Weekly, Paul, about how Google Docs is very feature-like compared to something like Microsoft Word.  But for some people, people like Gina, maybe Jeff and me as well, that's a feature.  That's a benefit. We don't want all those features.  Yep, yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft has now, and it's just starting to roll out their Office web applications, right?  Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, which are their cloud-based versions of those Microsoft Office applications.  So I've just started using the Word web app as my word processor for my daily work.  Because this is stuff that ends up on the web anyway.  And it turns out moving something that you're typing in a web browser to some other form in a web browser  is actually very natural and it works very well.  This thing is dramatically more full-featured than Google Docs from an editing perspective, I would say.  That's part of the problem though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Going through Microsoft features to find something is like going through Facebook's privacy to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that would be true, I think, of the Word application.  But actually the web app version sits, I would say, somewhere halfway between Google Docs and traditional Word from a functionality standpoint.  So just looking at, for example, Word 2010, the desktop app has like six, seven tabs of toolbars and so forth,  whereas the web version is three.  And it's not just three tabs worth of toolbars, it's three really dramatically scaled down sets of functions.  It's all the basic stuff.  In fact, I haven't done this yet and maybe I should, but if I were to compare this to Google Docs, I bet they're actually pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it require Silverlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if you have Silverlight, it's actually a better performing version, I guess, if you have Silverlight in the browser.  So is it JavaScript?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how they implement it. I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it works across Chrome, Firefox, IE.  It must be JavaScript. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a way for a Mac user or a Linux user to have what has traditionally been a Windows-only experience  because this thing looks and works a lot like Office 2010 on Windows.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oregon has just announced it's going to bring Google Apps to all of its classrooms statewide.  You do keep seeing wins for Google Docs over Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So I mean, I would say with some exceptions, for example, Office Web Apps is free.  So that's free for anybody.  But when you look at Microsoft's enterprise cloud services, like they have awful names, but essentially hosted exchange, hosted SharePoint, and so forth,  there is no free version like there is on Google.  So schools like the free stuff.  Yeah. And this is tough because schools actually do get Microsoft stuff for free, although they don't get the exchange stuff.  They get the Hotmail Windows Live stuff.  So there are colleges all over the United States that can use Google or Windows Live as the back end.  Right. And it has your EDU address or whatever.  So those two companies both do the same thing there.  But Google does offer Google Apps for free.  There's a free version of it.  And that's actually a huge deal because I think small businesses, businesses of any kind, actually,  they're always constrained from a financial standpoint.  And I think a lot of them can get away with using the free version.  And Microsoft just doesn't have that.  And that's something I've been writing them on because the base price for hosted exchange is basically $5 per month per employee.  But you have to have at least five people doing it.  And it gets kind of expensive over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Docs.com the same as the general Office Web Docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So actually, Docs.com is Office Web Applications.  It's the same exact platform.  The only difference is that for collaboration purposes or for sharing purposes, you're going through your Facebook contacts list instead of your Windows Live.  I think that's going to help them a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to introduce a lot of people.  I bet you a lot of people didn't even know that you could use Office online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that was the I didn't know this.  I mean, the day they announced this, you suddenly have this light go off in your head and you realize this is a platform that Microsoft is going to be basically handing out to people.  And they'll be able to customize it in their own ways.  Now, there aren't a lot of Facebooks in the world.  But, you know, companies like Facebooks that have lots of people using that service will be able to use their own branded versions of Office Web Applications.  It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see before we get to our tip and tool and number, none of which we have.  Is there any other subjects or stories you fellows would like to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just let me just briefly.  I wanted just to talk about that HTC thing.  Yeah.  The deal there actually is that Microsoft is going after the same intellectual property and patent licensing concerns that it has with Linux.  You know, Android is based on Linux.  So Microsoft has actually contacted a bunch of Android handset makers to talk to them about cross licensing of patents.  Now, HTC doesn't have their own mobile patents like Motorola would or one of the bigger companies that's been around for a while.  So they can't do a cross licensing agreement.  So the HTC agreement, HTC is actually going to pay Microsoft to indemnify itself against any patent claims.  But I think you're going to see more agreements like that in the future, just as we did with Linux companies between Linux and Microsoft.  So I think this is just an extension of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they had no choice because they didn't have any patents.  HTC had to settle with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, these companies will all reach.  There was no settlement.  No one sued anyone.  I mean, licensing agreement, I should say.  They contacted, yeah, they reached an agreement.  So the agreement was that Microsoft would not pour salt on them and destroy them forever.  Does that help them in the Apple lawsuit?  Well, I think HTC, I mean.  Yeah.  As Apple's suing them, of course.  No, not at all.  And in fact, I've seen some speculation around that.  I don't see how it could.  I mean, well, actually, that's not necessarily true.  Depends if these are competing patents.  Yeah, it depends on what the, right.  So if Microsoft has patents around multi-touch or things like that, actually, yes, I suppose.  See, I didn't realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Normally in a patent lawsuit situation, it's kind of mutually assured destruction.  You've got patents.  We've got patents.  You sue us.  We'll sue you back.  I didn't realize HTC had no patents.  HTC is kind of a small company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're very vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're completely vulnerable.  And that explains now why Apple did not go after Google.  It went after HTC because HTC has no patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has an endless supply of cash.  They could fight this forever.  Right.  And probably has a lot of patents as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they could counter sue as well.  So go after HTC.  Maybe they'll make a deal with Apple.  It's nibbling around Google.  And I guess Microsoft's nibbling around Google too, because Microsoft's not suing Google.  They're going after the handset manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So anybody else who uses Android, are they in the same position that HTC is in now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And in fact, that's one of the things in the press release.  They don't name names, but they say,  You're next.  We are in contact with a bunch of other Android.  If you're making an Android phone, there'll be a knock at your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it accepted that Microsoft legitimately has these...  I mean, in other words, is Linux...  If I do a Linux distro, do I license this stuff from Microsoft?  Is that generally accepted?  Hundreds of companies have already done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this has been one of those many quiet Microsoft things.  They've gone to the big companies.  They've gone to the small companies.  And the basic deal is you're indemnifying not just the company itself that is creating some Linux-based solution,  but also their customers.  So it's a...  Presumably someone has actually looked and said,  Oh, yes, you do have a valid patent for whatever.  But obviously as a part of these agreements, none of those companies are talking about anything like that.  So that's just speculation, I guess.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you know what areas the patents are in?  The Linux patents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Microsoft patents, I guess.  No, I mean, right.  No, no, I don't.  Google is a very open company.  And this was something that Andy Rubin discussed in the New York Times interview.  There are actually benefits to that, but there are also downsides to it.  They release the source code for all the stuff that they're doing.  Microsoft can look at it and say, here, here, here, you know,  and then they have their basis for going after those companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ina Fried writing at CNET says,  It's not clear to what degree, if any, the Microsoft agreement will help HTC in its battle against Apple.  However, she quotes Gartner analyst Ken Dulaney.  He says, that's the key battle for HTC.  He says, if this doesn't help in some way in HTC against Apple, I don't think HTC gains much.  Well, Microsoft wasn't there to help HTC.  Microsoft was there to get its license fees, obviously.  Hey, Leo?  Yes, sir.  I think I'm taking off.  All right.  Jeff Jarvis, he is the blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  Thank you for making all that yeoman-like effort to get with us.  We'll see you, Ben.  You're back in New York.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, Jeff.  Safe flight, Jeff.  And there he goes.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Yeah, fascinating story.  And of course, the big story, once again, to recap, and Paul Brokett on the show right  at the beginning, HP is buying Palm for $1.2 billion, making the folks at Elevation Partners  breathe a huge sigh of relief because they were into Palm for several hundred million  dollars.  That's Bono's venture firm run by Roger McNamee.  And they put a pretty big investment in Palm late in the game, hoping that WebOS would  take off.  Palm's stock price got more and more depressed.  Now the HP deal is, I think, valuing it at $5.70, which is, I think, a pretty hefty premium  over its last price, $1.2 billion for Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff's number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's make that the number of the week.  Gina, do you have a tip that you'd like to pass along?  I do.  We kind of did one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  I did a couple, but I do have one that we actually didn't cover.  YouTube.com slash store.  You can rent movies, 48-hour rental, 99 cents to $3.99.  You pay with Google checkout.  I think Read Write Web wrote about this.  It wasn't really a big launch.  The selection of movies, it seems to be sort of indie films and documentaries, but there's  some good stuff here.  The September issue, actually, which Leo, you and I talked and chatted about.  That's a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched it because of you.  That's $3.99.  Precious, which is a fantastic movie.  Brothers, don't see that.  That wasn't so good.  But there are some really good movies here.  Like I said, I haven't tried this, but if you click on one of the movies, $3.99, you  pay with, so you rent for 24 hours.  It's Stream, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You complete the payment.  It's a Google checkout payment.  So, this is kind of interesting.  Another way to, I guess we don't need another way to rent movies, but kind of interesting  that YouTube is doing this.  It'll be interesting to see where this goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder why they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of just getting the game, I guess, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's interesting when you do rent that movie, then on the right, you  get a bunch, as you do on anywhere on YouTube, a bunch of other videos.  Related to?  Yeah, some of the movies, but some of them just YouTube videos, including it looks like  some pirate versions of the movie.  Here's Girl with a Pearl Earring, part five through nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.  So, you could rent it or you could watch the fake version on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And another kind of really minor video related thing now is that you can narrow your search  results for TV shows by season.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was going to be one of the tools I talked about.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you kind of drill down on the sidebar there, but yeah, kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I do that all the time.  Is that in the show options column?  I got to keep that thing open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, hit show options and then click on videos under all results.  And then under all videos, you can see episodes.  Yeah, I mean, you really have to drill down to see this and then you can filter by season.  There's the episode guide.  Yeah, so I just searched for The Wire.  So I have season one through season five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and then there's a drop down of like, you can choose which episode.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, when you're trying to find that episode of The Office that you missed, you  can literally drill down by the number, the season on the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some of these are YouTube links.  I see an Amazon link.  Huh.  Huh.  Great.  This will help me pirate television.  That's fantastic.  Exactly.  There you go.  Look at that.  That's great.  Everywhere you can find it.  Well, thank you.  That is a great tip.  We already had a number and my tool was actually going to be Google Earth in the browser.  We showed that earlier.  No, it's fine.  I don't mind.  We've got a nice tour of it.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to thank you so much, Paul Therotte, for joining us, giving us the Microsoft perspective  and the scoop on HP.  Paul Therotte is the host of Windows Weekly, one of our great podcasts, a really great  podcast.  Highly recommended if you haven't heard it.  At twit.tv slash ww.  He's also the man in charge of the super site for Windows, winsupersite.com.  And it's a good place to go if you want to know what's up with the latest Windows.  There's Paul with his mug.  Paul's mug with a mug.  Super site for Windows winsupersite.com.  And of course, his book is Windows 7 secrets and the new one coming out Windows phone secrets.  He's writing it right now.  Look at that.  You really did get that blog post up.  HP acquires Palm.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I talk about productivity.  Multitasking.  Serious multitasking on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Multitasking.  That's fantastic.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org and the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave,  completewaveride.com.  There was some wave news I forgot.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can remove people from a wave.  Yes.  Kind of embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally.  Just a small feature, but much needed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But one of those features that was just like so conspicuously missing.  So you can remove.  You can remove somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
