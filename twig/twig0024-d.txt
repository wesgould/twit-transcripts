And joining me right now around the country from San Diego, California, Gina Trapani.  Hey, Gina.  It's good to see you again.  Welcome back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From New York, New York, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Oh, Nexus One.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's showing off his Nexus One.  You know, I'm actually, and you probably, if you're listening, you're going, what's  wrong with Leo?  I'm actually not in the studio today.  We're at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, which is replete with Nexus Ones.  I've never seen so many Nexus Ones.  Everybody's got one and everybody who has one is quick to show it off.  And you know what's really sad?  I ordered it Tuesday and I know it's sitting back home waiting for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Jeff, you bought it, you didn't buy it, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  I did.  All right, let's see.  I've been waiting for the show all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Show off.  Show off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm dying to know what Jeff thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I went to an event.  We'll find out in a moment.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get the feeling that Jeff hates it and I love it.  So I'm really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's wrong.  What I tweeted, you know, it's the bloggers curse you, you quote yourself or repeat yourself.  I'll do both.  I tweeted that I felt as if I cheated on my wife.  That is to say Steve Jobs is by going to a strip bar that it is to say Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is a very tortured analogy.  I'm sorry.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  He's cheating.  I've been talking about how the problem was that it was rather like an S&M bar because  it was Google saying you will do this as of a.  Oh, interesting.  Basically, it just doesn't replace the iPhone for me.  I understand what you said, Gina, on your post at SmarterWear that it becomes a marker  of the true geeky, which shows that I'm not.  I rather like that Apple goes to the effort to figure out how we think so that we don't  have to think.  Microsoft, on the other hand, requires us to think like Bill Gates and Microsoft.  Google, which wants to intuit our intent, needs, I think, to get a little bit more like  Apple.  They just didn't think through some stuff and I just felt like I was going back through  a maze, getting it working.  At the end of the day, my Apple is just more comforting.  I still have my strobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much of that, Jeff, do you think is just familiarity?  How much of it is really that this is not a polished product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's absolutely right, Leo.  What Gina said, and I don't mean to steal any of your thunder, Gina, but you always  say so many smart things, you have plenty left over, is that those who treasure openness  will treasure the Android.  I understand that and I get that.  I think you're absolutely right about the familiarity.  I basically think that if the iPhone hadn't existed and this were first, I would be gaga  in love with this.  The iPhone is a hard act to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, as a Droid user, of course, I'm going to be very comfortable immediately  with the Nexus One and the ones I've played with are much faster than the Droid.  I mean, noticeably swifter and that's kind of showed off by that live desktop thing they're  doing.  There's more front pages, right?  There's four front pages.  That's a good thing.  I hate it, the three.  It's too limited.  I can't wait to play with it.  I love the industrial design.  You agree?  Come on, you've got to say it's got a good industrial design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good hand candy, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hand candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm interested to know.  I think that Android requires just a huge paradigm shift for iPhone users.  I think you go into the phone with this familiarity with this particular experience, the Apple  experience, which is beautiful.  I think that when you pick up Android, it just feels weird.  I'm interested to know what happened when you started using it.  What are the things that it's missing the most or the things that just made you go,  what the hell is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was deja vu with Windows.  You want to go turn on the Wi-Fi.  You've got to go through six steps to do that.  You've got to understand their logic.  There's a home button on the machine, which operates differently if you're in an app  burnout and then if you're in an app, there's a second home button.  It's silly stuff like that.  I admit it's silly, but it makes me respect the artistry of Apple all the more, the detail  oriented work.  Again, if I started with this thing, would I love it?  Yeah, I'm sure I would.  I honestly am debating whether to return it or not, just because $529 would be my wife  gasp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  You want to return it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm debating.  We're debating.  Just because, when I look at my budget, do I get ... I really want to buy the Sony new  bloggy camera they have with 360 on it.  I want to buy the Apple thing, I think.  I'm a professor.  I want to be a little penurious, but I think I probably have to hold on to it because I  do this show and I care about things Google and I want to see what happens with it.  I'm sure Gina sees a potential in it that I don't know how to see yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd just like to point out that only a professor would use the word penurious, but that's another  matter entirely.  Why did you not buy the subsidized version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because by the time you add up all the money, it's ridiculous and I'll go back and  forth.  If this thing would work on AT&T's frequency and I could just switch back and forth my  SIM, I'd be in some form of heaven.  If I could tether it, I'd really be in heaven.  If it tethered, that would take away any cost justification issues and I would have bought  the subsidized one.  This way I'm freer.  I can go to Europe.  I can use it.  I can turn it off and not use it, but then I'm already feeling guilty if I turn it off.  How silly is that?  How silly is it to carry two phones?  I'm asking this of a man who carries about 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, I've got my Android, my Droid, and I've got my iPhone and I can't wait to play  with the Nexus One.  Google's not here really at CES.  They don't have a booth.  They're here in a lot of ways.  In fact, it's interesting.  They're everywhere.  They're everywhere really and it's interesting that that announcement was the day before  CES.  It's kind of like one of the things people are talking about in the Apple slate.  The two biggest stories at CES didn't happen in Las Vegas, but I have to say, as I was  at this Android event, there were Android developers there.  There was also an Android there.  I think it was Google.  I don't know who paid, but somebody paid for data, the Android, from Star Trek, The Next  Generation, Brent Spiner to be at this event and LeVar Burton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who tweeted, by the way, that he got something very nice from Google and all he would say  was that it pays to have played an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he got an Android phone.  In fact, Brent and LeVar were just on the show a couple of hours ago and of course they  both whipped out their Nexus 1s.  I asked them, what do you think?  Hollywood stars, they get this crap all the time.  They said, oh, it's cool, but I don't think they used it at all.  I don't think they were using it as a phone.  It's a beautiful phone though, isn't it?  It's just a gorgeous phone.  Now, okay, we've heard Jeff the curmudgeon.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm in love with it and I should preface this by saying that I think it depends a lot  on your upgrade path.  I was coming from a G1, an unlocked G1 using AT&T's Edge network and running Android 1.6.  I already know Android and I've got slow network and slow hardware.  I get the Nexus 1 this week and I'm just over the moon because I get a triple upgrade.  I get network, software, and hardware.  I'm in love.  I noticed all the upgrades to Android because I've been using 1.6 and I went from 1.6 to  I didn't have the Droid.  I noticed a lot of new stuff in Android.  I'm loving that the navigation, even though live papers, even though they're just a sort  of CPU sucking eye candy, I still love that they make the device feel alive in your hand.  The phone itself is flat and thin and I can slide it in my pocket without the keyboard.  I feel like I have my iPhone again.  It doesn't make my thighs look fat.  Does this phone make my thighs look fat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really carry a purse and it goes in the pocket.  The G1 was really chunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think it is a spectacularly beautiful phone.  I don't think you could deny that.  It's a spectacularly beautiful phone.  I think it is a geek phone.  Oh no, Gina.  Uh oh.  Are we losing our connectivity here?  I think it's a geek phone.  I think that's kind of the point of it.  I think, Jeff, really that's what you're saying is that it's not a user phone.  It's not an iPhone.  I'm going to pause until I figure out what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a geek phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, it almost is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, I think it's just contrast, Leo.  I think Gina's right though.  Gina, why don't you say what you said in your smart aware post about this as a marker of  humans and geek bigotry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, David Pogue wrote a piece this week about how he had done a Nexus One review  and all these kind of Android fanboys, similar to kind of the Linux fanboys, came out and  called them out on all this stuff and were crazy and called them names.  I was saying how I felt the need to confess that when I see somebody holding an Android  handset, I kind of make some assumptions about them, similar assumptions that I make about  when people who I see using Linux.  I think this is a power geek.  This is someone who knows what they're doing.  This is someone who values open source so much that they're willing to jump through  a few hoops to get it.  And this is someone with Android anyway, I think is kind of on the cutting edge.  And really, it's the openness part.  You know, this is a phone for people who really value openness and for geeks still.  I still think that it is a phone and mobile operating system for geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a business problem for Google then, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it might be.  I don't think that the phone is quite, it doesn't have the mainstream appeal that the  iPhone does.  But I think that what Android does have going for it is this kind of counterculture appeal.  You know, like the underdog, the, you know, the, you know, thinking different.  You know, people who use Android phones are really are kind of have that, that, that,  that kind of, they should, they should use that in their marketing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But do you think it's Google's goal to sell as many phones as Apple does?  I mean, is it, is, is, does the Nexus One have to be a iPhone killer?  I don't think that's, that's requisite for Google's to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Android, Android wants to, they want Android to be successful, but I don't think  the Nexus One has to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's true.  That's true.  But the Nexus One is there, I feel like Google's way of trying to say, hey, we can make a phone  that's just as, is beautiful and good looking though, or close, you know, close to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I talked at this event, I talked to the guy who designed this phone.  His name is Eric.  He actually designed the G1 as well, or worked with HTC on the G1.  And I, one of the things I asked him is why, why even sell it unsubsidized?  You know, that's $589 is a lot of money.  He said, well, it's not that much money, which kind of surprised me.  Because it is a lot of money, not just for penurious professors, but for everybody.  And I think one of the things that he said is, well, first of all, people understand  that a phone doesn't cost nothing or a hundred bucks.  It costs thousands of dollars when you add up, you know, all of the, you know, the two-year  commitment.  So, you know, they do offer the two-year commitment.  And I got the sense that this was, you know, I said, so what are you doing next?  And he said, well, the next phone.  This is just the beginning of Google's, you know, long march into the phone world.  And I think they're going to make phones, this is kind of what he said, for everybody.  So there's the, you know, there's the click.  There's all sorts of Android phones.  This is the one for the geek.  And that's why it's being sold unbundled, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think my hesitation here is also that I wish Google had gone farther to blow up  the model.  I think that's what we were talking about the last few weeks, the hope that it was going  to really change the phone industry.  And it didn't.  Basically, you can buy an iPhone untethered to the contract.  You can buy this thing without a contract.  You can spend a lot of money for both.  That's that.  And if Google had done anything to have an ad-supported model, or if it had been truly  portable across AT&T, T-Mobile, that would have gone at least one step to breaking things  up.  And they didn't.  They just didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  They tried to make a big hullabaloo about, you know, opening up the Google phone store  and doing some things so different.  But they really didn't.  I wish they had gone farther.  I wish there had been more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, the next thing is they are biting off a lot here.  They've got to go into entire fields of business they've never been in.  They've never been a hardware company.  They've never been a retail company.  They've never really been in the phone business beyond that until recently.  These are big shifts for a purely geek, algorithmically based company to go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But a renewed commitment to Google Checkout, which was kind of interesting.  I mean, Google Checkout felt like one of those products that, you know, was kind of this  side thing that no one ever really used.  But this was like they're serious about Checkout, which I'm very happy about personally because  I sell my book using Checkout.  So I'm hoping that lots of people have Checkout accounts now.  But so interesting to see that renewed commitment to that product and that they're putting that  front and center in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw some stories on the friend feed that there were a few people who had problems with  the Checkout.  One guy was forced to use his old address for his old Gmail account or his old Checkout  account.  He'd moved in the meantime.  FedEx has to try to deliver it to the old address three times before it will go to the  new address.  That stuff happens.  I'm not going to hold it too much against Google, but it is funny to see that they have  problems like that.  Right.  I also tried to buy the phone the first instant I could on my iPhone and the Checkout wouldn't  work on my iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it must be in flash and it wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that you tried to buy the Nexus One on your iPhone.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also used Google Goggles to try to look at the Apple logo and it didn't recognize

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  it.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  So what do you think that they could have done better?  I feel like if they'd launched with a few more carriers, like you said, if they had  supported the AT&T 3G, truly supported AT&T 3G, which meant that iPhone owners could have  bought the Nexus One and popped in their SIM card on the same level of service.  That would have been a killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't really know why they didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although the price for the unlocked version does feel high to me.  You could say the iPhone has the iPod touch.  It's not a phone, but essentially it's an iPhone without a contract or without a speaker  on it.  It's kind of like getting an Android device without having to buy into a contract.  But there's got to be a better way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that again, if I could use it on AT&T, if I could use it to tether, that would justify  it because I now have an AT&T laptop card.  And so if I could use my iPhone, rather my ether phone, but if I could use my Nexus as  a MiFi, that would be killer.  That would be absolutely killer.  It would justify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of that, I think there's software called PDAnet that does provide tethering  for Android.  I think that you have to install software actually on your Mac and then install the  app on Android itself.  Now, I haven't tried this recently.  I looked into it a while back, a few versions back.  I used to use that on my trio.  Okay, yeah.  It looks like it's still around.  It looks like it's still around and it looks like it's 30 bucks to buy for your Mac.  Interesting.  I have not tried this though, but it sounds like it has been ported to Android.  You can tether with Android for sure if you root the phone, but that's really...  There you go again, Jeannie.  You see, I'm immortal.  You're a deep goddess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where we are in life here.  to expect a person, a human to do.  the phone.  You can't do that on Android still.  I'm going to do it on my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do it on my iPhone.  I'm going to do it on my iPhone.  I'm going to do it on my iPhone.  And so I looked at the app and it's like, oh, the phone has to be rooted first and then  I can use this app.  So it's crazy.  You know, that just doesn't count.  What do you want it to be next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, even though you love it and you should, what do you wish it were next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that the main thing that Android needs to be is just a better media  player.  I mean, the iPhone has all the iPod capabilities built in.  The fact that it's not obvious to a new Android user, how do you get music onto this thing?  How do you manage your playlists?  I mean, you know, just getting some, you know, my work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it ironic that Google, which has more of a web presence Lord knows than Apple has,  doesn't have the means to really get you the apps and the music and the other stuff.  It doesn't have a home that you want to come to, which which feels like a missing piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, but does it feel like a missing piece just because you're used to syncing  your iPhone to iTunes or so easy?  Yeah. Well, but the thing is, this is the cool thing about Android.  You know, you boot up the phone, you type in your credentials, you log into Google without  ever attaching the phone to your computer.  And now your contacts, calendar and email are on the phone.  Period. I really like that.  Like, I think that's cool. So so that the iPhone thing where you have to dock it to your  computer and you buy apps, you sync apps back and forth and podcasts.  I mean, you're attached to iTunes, which I think everyone's sort of gotten used to because,  you know, we're all used to iTunes. I am, too.  But but I think that the over the air, that putting a lot of that over the air in Android  is actually a good thing.  But the music thing is the issue.  So you have to know to download Double Twist, which is this open source software, and  and you can't play songs that you bought from the iTunes store that are DRM.  I mean, there's a lot of things that you have to know or realize that that no no regular  person should reasonably have to have to know.  So I like that. That a lot of the setting up the Android phone doesn't involve docking it  to your computer at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right there. Yes.  But but I guess what I'm going to is what one reaction I had when I got it was that this is  absolutely true of both iPhone and Android.  And maybe it's a happy problem to have.  But to use Clay Shirky's words, in the app world, there's terrible filter failure.  It is just now there's so much choice that it's really impossible to know what you want.  It reminds me of the early days of blogs.  And people would always ask me, which blog should I start reading?  And I'll say, I don't know. What do you like?  Right. Right.  And so the same problem. I understand that with with apps, I don't want a one size fits all thing.  But and there are a few apps.  Clay, in fact, responded to my tweet saying I think it was Appify is an effort to soon to do that.  But it's it's a problem and it just strikes me it's 10 percent harder to try to navigate that abundance on the phone than on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah, that's definitely true.  So did you feel like so you're talking about the Android market when you go into the Android market, you were like not sure where how to get the good stuff, where to go, what to search for that kind of thing.  Yeah, right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you find you get the few first most popular in certain areas like news and say, OK, I got it.  And I didn't find Tweety.  So I put in seismic and OK, I got a Twitter client now, which, by the way, the weekly mirror, you make the type so small, I felt like I was 90 years old.  But look at that.  But, you know, I think that that's an issue to make people happier.  You know, one way to look at this, too, is if you compare this to a Windows phone.  It's heaven, right?  You've arrived at the land of logic.  Right. And to some extent, I think, you know,  the Nokia OS, too, as well, rather that that you know, this is a huge leap for anybody.  If you're not an iPhone person, Android is certainly hands down the second best OS.  Does that fight words to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm I know.  No, I'm with you. I'm with you on that.  I am, you know, I like Android because I can do things on it that I just can't do on the iPhone.  And there are probably things that don't that don't matter to normal people.  But, like, you know, for instance, this is just this is always my example.  The one thing that I do on my phone the most is I text my spouse, right?  I text my wife. So I want to just be able to tap one thing and have a compose.  But, you know, area, you know, a text area come up so I can just type and go.  Right. And and the iPhone, you have to you can do I think you can do shortcuts to a contact.  Right. But then you have to tap to say I want to text and you choose a phone number or whatever.  So like on Android, I can say I can have a direct shortcut to that.  On Android, I can create folders on my on my home screens.  I can't do that on the iPhone.  I can I can arrange my my icons into folders.  You can get widgets on the on home screen like the Google search box.  But I think I think the iPhone has a search box.  But, you know, Android also has that news widget, which is pretty cool.  And that power control. It just these things are kind of buried a little deep.  This thing that I just feel flat.  Right. Right.  This is the issue. Right.  So the initial experience with the iPhone is actually quite good and compelling.  And you get it right away.  The initial experience with Android is not it's confusing.  And you don't know where this stuff is.  You don't know that you tap and hold the home screen to get a pop up dial.  I mean, so many things that you just don't know unless you really play with it.  I appreciate software that you kind of have to discover and has these little things  that you find here and there. But like a car.  Because I'm crazy. Right. Right.  Because I just I like that kind of thing.  That's what I do. I think for I think the trick is to come up with  the product that does both.  It has the initial compelling experience, but also has layers of discoverability in it.  You know, and I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it's also an issue of control, isn't it?  In all Apple products, you are out of control.  You put yourself in the hands of the Lord of jobs and off you go.  Whereas in every other area of technology.  And I've got a little bit of this left full of my genes.  Yeah, you have this chance to do so.  But then the next trick is to make it easy enough for anybody to do it.  So you just don't waste time on it. Right.  I hate having to search through illogic to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I totally agree with you and get that for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to stay. I'm back to stand up for the Google Nexus one.  You're a bad man, Jeff Jarvis.  You're a bad man. Stop ganging up on us.  No, I have to say, I so elegant, so beautiful.  I like the Android operating system.  And one thing we're seeing at CES is a lot of devices with the Android operating system.  So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.  And we'll also talk about the problem with the name Nexus one.  Apparently, Philip K. Dick's family is very unhappy.  That's in just a minute as we continue with Jeff Jarvis from  Buzz Machine dot com, Gina Tripoli from Smarterware dot org  and me from Las Vegas on the 75th birthday of Elvis Presley.  Perfectly appropriate.  And we're going to do that in just a second.  But first, I want to mention my friends at Sync.  Ford made some big announcements here.  In fact, we talked to the CEO of Ford, Alan Mulally, and the guy behind  connectivity services at Sync.  And what really is happening with Ford Sync is they're putting your  all the connectivity you're used to at home into their Ford cars  and their Lincolns and their Mercuries.  And it's very, very exciting.  In this 2011 model year, later this calendar year,  almost all the vehicles Ford sells will have Sync or something.  Now they're calling it my Ford and my Ford Touch.  They'll be able to get this.  I know you're going to be excited about this.  Listen to Pandora. Their music.  Absolutely. Create your own radio station.  Stitcher. You're going to be able to tweet.  You'll be able to surf the Internet when you're not driving, by the way,  because safety is paramount.  But the whole idea of Sync is you're going to keep your hands on the wheel,  your eyes on the road and yet be able to interact with your whole life.  I love it. And I know you're going to love it.  And the best way to find out more about it is to go to the website  SyncMyRide.com. SyncMyRide.com.  Or go to a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer and say,  I don't care about the car. I just want to test drive the Sync.  I guess you have the car comes with it. Think of it that way.  I just saw a statistic that 32 percent of the people who are buying new  Ford vehicles are buying them because of Sync.  That's how important these features are.  Take a look. SyncMyRide.com.  I thought that was an interesting statistic.  Jeff, because it shows that  how important connectivity, I think, is to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the announcement this week, not to extend the commercial,  but the announcement this week about Twitter and Sync Your Ride  is just really, I think, wonderful.  Bringing the feed you have back into your mobile experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, the New York Times raised the absolutely legitimate issue of  talking about distracted drivers.  Now we've got people tweeting while they're driving.  And that's going to be an issue, I think.  But I think it's an issue that we're going to deal with one way  whether or not you have Ford Sync.  I mean, that's what people are doing.  They're just put it's better than having your BlackBerry.  The BlackBerry, you know how people drive with their BlackBerry.  I don't know what you call it.  The BlackBerry stretch where you've got your your your hands on the wheel  and you're using your thumbs and you prop the BlackBerry  against the steering wheel of type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm ashamed. Let's pick up a name for this right now.  How about calling that suicide surfing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, suicide surfing. I love it.  Jeff, ever the wordsmith.  And I confess to having done it.  So I think that this is an issue, regardless of whether you've got a vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think that Twitter is going to become at some level audio  and probably through Google?  And that's why Google, again, wants to be so damn smart about  understanding our spoken word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's really I agree with you 100 percent.  What's really interesting is the speech recognition in sync.  I talked to the guys at Nuance who do Dragon naturally speaking.  That's who's doing the speech recognition in sync.  And the reason that they didn't have dictation of Twitter  and they may still not have that for some time to come is  it is no really easy way to edit it if you're driving.  So it screws up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, another boring post after another boring post. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're really so there are there are perhaps some real limitations to this.  But it just shows you how connected we are now and how certainly as input.  Yeah, it does read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing experience the other night.  I was I was picking up my car. Sorry, it's not a Ford.  It's a many year old Toyota coming back on an interstate in New Jersey.  And bingo, as soon as I got on the off the ramp, absolutely stopped.  So I was OK if I tweeted and I turn on this horrible local radio.  Nothing. I turn on everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that awful? Local radio is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's awful. So then I then I go, of course, to Twitter and I search for 287.  The interstate. Bingo.  Just saw a huge explosion.  This is happened. That's happening. We're forming each other.  It was an instant social network on the interstate.  I also discovered some other automated feeds for giving me stock. Yep.  So I can well imagine that I could have a system where a I could have input  into that saying 287 is porked. Right.  And I can also get output of saying, just give me any updates on 287.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're just not willing to get disconnected.  And the value is so apparent of full time always on connections  that companies like, you know, Ford and all the companies now.  Kia is also here with Microsoft Auto built in.  I mean, everybody's going to do this because we just don't want to be disconnected.  And I think the phone getting us back to the Nexus one really is the centerpiece  of our digital life.  So let me ask you this, Jeff.  Keyboard, the onscreen keyboard in the Nexus one, you can live with that.  You're you're an iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't. And somebody held up somebody who has the droid held it up  against the Nexus one, and it really looked like it was, you know,  military issue versus civilian issues. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Terminator phone.  Versus, I don't know, Brigitte Bardot.  I love I love the Vegas too long.  Oh, I could have been much worse, believe me.  I love the I love the predictive text on Android.  I think it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the predictive text is great.  What do you think about the voice transcription?  I mean, I really like the idea.  It's it's it you have to really enunciate and be in a quiet place.  And I can see myself using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know. But I think you're right.  I don't think it's quite there yet, but it's getting there.  And I think it's well.  So I asked nuance, I said, doesn't Google have a huge advantage  in voice recognition because of Google 411?  And nuance said, why do you think we have an iPhone application  called Dragon Dictate?  They have an application on the iPhone you dictate to.  It doesn't do the recognition on the phone.  It sends it to their servers where they collect the samples.  They're doing the same thing.  They realize what an advantage Google has with Google 411,  and they're going to do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it makes me wonder just as you talk about that.  Where shouldn't that be a great open source crowdsourced project?  Shouldn't there be the audio?  You know, I think I said I'm going on the board of the  reading for the blind and dyslexic  and had suggested to them that they should do a an audio  Wikipedia version, right?  What if you turn it around and do the Wikipedia model for audio?  What if we made audio recognition  and open sourced project to the people and make that  able for lots of developers to then use?  That'd be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if you can groups, you can crowdsource  that kind of development. Maybe you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many samples of the word Laporte do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For you to write. No, that's a good point.  So you have everybody.  So you're saying have everybody go to a page and record the word  that's on the page, just like recapture is capturing.  Exactly. Yeah.  Oh, that's an interesting idea.  Yeah, you could do that.  Maybe you've started something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say you need this many samples against this many,  you know, speaking types,  excluding people who talk to them fast like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Gina, it was also fast talkers.  Lovely little tones.  I have to say that the Nexus one name may be in jeopardy.  The this is bizarre.  If you ever read the book or, you know, you actually would have seen it  in the movie as well. Blade Runner or the Philip K.  book, Philip K. Dick novel.  Do Androids dream of electric sheep?  You may remember that the robots, the Androids in there were Nexus  models and the Nexus six model.  And I guess Philip K. Dick's family said,  hey, we thought of that first.  Philip thought of that first in there.  Are they suing over the name Nexus?  They're threatening to.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of pathetic because it really is a tribute to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Android. Get it. Android Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And the story that's on the on the friend feed  feed makes a point that it's not as if they own that name in all domains.  No, it's kind of ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they saw that Lucas spent, you know, they licensed droid from Lucas.  So maybe they'll license Nexus from us.  A little grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's all kind of stupidity going on in terms of control,  not to go too far afield off this, but just a quick mention  that News International News Corp  now has forbidden a an aggregator in the UK from linking to them.  And this aggregator has started a campaign under the URL  Right to Link.org to Numeral Link.  News now has saying that the link is a right of ours.  Can't tell me not to link to you.  That's crazy.  Can't tell me not to mention the word Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we've seen this before with deep linking.  But is this but they're actually saying you can't even you can't link in any way to us.  It's not just deep linking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you see, this is two parts where you can't scrape,  which is what robots text is all about.  But then again, you know, if you go to the next step on this,  it occurs to me, what if the government says at some point,  you can't scrape our data if it's in public?  It's in public.  Right. And I should be able to read it and send to it in any form I choose,  with any device I choose.  That's what I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a question for our law show, because but I do believe this is not the first time  with these kinds of lawsuits have been deep linking lawsuits.  There have been linking lawsuits and people have attempted to block this.  I'm pretty sure they've been attempted to block scraping as well.  I don't know what the results of those are, but I have a feeling they can't have been successful  or the Internet wouldn't be working anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Precisely. Well, not just the Internet,  but neither would democracy.  Very common journalism that quotes everybody.  Journalism. Yeah.  It's information. Right.  And the fact that a journalistic organization is doing this is appalling.  There was also a UK organization called the NLA, the Newspaper Licenses Association,  who was trying to charge companies for linking to newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You published it. That's ridiculous.  That's absurd. You published it.  Of course, we can link to it.  If you don't publish it, we won't link to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Philip K.  Dick's family and Rupert Burdok and the Associated Press and the NLA  all go off in a room together and close yourself off from the whole world.  And you'll be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put them all in the same bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for letting me say that. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to say to you, Jeff, you should give your Nexus one a week.  You should you should put the iPhone away and use your Nexus for a while  and give it a shot, because I think you're going to get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to. I've got 14 days. Yeah.  By the way, if I do return it, it's a forty five dollar restocking fee.  I think what? Oh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw your tweet about that. That that kind of sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. That's ridiculous.  That's not very Googley, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's, by the way, not what normally the phone companies do.  If you go to T-Mobile and you and you sign up and buy a phone  and in two weeks you say, you know, it doesn't work very well.  They take it back. You have no there's no fee. There's no charge.  That's that's, I guess, one of the downsides of buying directly  from Google, the retailer.  Not such a good retailer, apparently.  In fact, there's articles already saying  that, you know, support is non-existent.  You know, customer Martin Thorberg says, I'm paying full price  for an unlocked phone, but I can't get Google to ship to my new address.  It'll only ship to my old Google account address.  And FedEx and Google with neither we give them both wouldn't change it.  They say you can't cancel the order in automated responses.  There's no one home, just androids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they need to iron out the wrinkles in the whole  the new retailer gig, for sure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also bugs with the two point one software,  photos that can't be deleted, inadequate 3G service.  Of course, T-Mobile, people are going to find, does not have the kind of coverage  they might be used to with Verizon, even AT&T.  Here's an example from the Google forums.  I love my Nexus phone.  Unfortunately, it can only perform as well as the network it runs on.  I'm here in Manhattan.  My iPhone AT&T was bad in terms of drop calls and slow data,  but the Nexus is even worse.  It makes my iPhone look like the golden choice again.  Let's just get it over with.  Where do I send the Nexus to return it?  And how long does it take to get my money back?  Oh, you know, cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is bound to happen.  And as somebody who's known for fetching a lot. Yeah.  You know, I get that, but it does say that there's an expectation  that's going to go on to Google.  We were talking two weeks ago about whether or not the media  moves against Google are true of the populace.  And Eugene has said, well, I don't think so among developers, real people.  And I agree.  But if enough consumers see Google as a  Dell hell brand, that's going to have an impact on the value of the whole damn company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you go to a T-Mobile store and look at or play with the Nexus one?  No, you can only buy it via Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then go to the T-Mobile store online, Leo.  You know, just just think people for a few seconds.  My German friends, they can see that you go.  People are going to be buying this thing like crazy.  I then want to go to the T-Mobile store.  It should have said on the home page, hey, new Nexus one owner.  Are you cool? Here's what we have to offer you. Right.  Nothing. Nothing.  I can't. The plans are confusing as hell.  They're flashed up like crazy.  But I can. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That also should have been better executed for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PC Magazine in a tear down, looking at the parts.  Actually, they're republishing the iSupply tear down.  iSupply does this every time a new hot gadget comes out.  They tear it down. They add up the cost of all the parts  and they come up with a cost of manufacture.  In this case, in fact, they announced it here at the Consumer Electronics Show.  They say when you tear it all down, the phone you buy for one hundred seventy  with a two year contract or five hundred twenty nine dollars without is about  one hundred seventy five dollars to manufacture.  That's actually pretty expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's expensive. That's a lot. That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a lot for a phone.  Snapdragon processor, which is a very fast processor.  It's got an OLED screen, very expensive screen.  I mean, they've they've really, you know, in some ways they.  And this doesn't surprise me.  This is they built a Cadillac here.  You know, unibody, you know, design kind of like the Apple notebooks.  It's a single, you know, that there's a single metallic shell  that everything is is embedded in dual microphone  that cancels background noise using an additional voice processor chip.  Now, that's expensive from audience semiconductor.  Then the droid does have a noise cancellation feature,  but this is the first one with the audience semiconductor.  And there are 17 components within the Nexus one.  The most expensive is the Snapdragon at thirty dollars.  That's 20 percent of the cost.  It's a one gigahertz Snapdragon, by the way.  And it's not it's been seen in other phones as well,  but it's a it's a very fast processor.  It's one of the reasons you could do 720p video on it.  The OLED display, twenty three dollars and fifty cents.  And it's according to iSupply that the only the second phone  to have a built in OLED display.  And it's the biggest OLED display on the market.  Four gigabytes of memory, another twenty dollars.  This is a pricey phone. You're buying a fancy phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope this means that this phone will make it through  at least a couple of more versions of Android.  I hope I'm hoping to make it to like Android 4.0 with this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you can. I think you will. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was saying to a friend of mine who was sad about not being able  to get the Nexus one because of budget, that I have a precious few weeks  of being able to gloat about having the best thing on the market  because surely something new will be out very, very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think they made it very clear that the  that this is not and again, this is what I got from my  talking to the developer, that this is not Google's only  Android phone and that they really and it's not the only Android phone  you'll see from any manufacturer. They really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That made me nervous. I agree with you.  That made me nervous that, oh, my God, you know, it's the Apple problem.  Right. Right. Here comes one device and then it gets better.  In a short time, you get mad at Apple.  I don't want Google.  I mean, I don't want Google to hold back on some brilliant idea.  But if they already have in the laboratory something better than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in a way, it's the opposite of the Apple problem,  because at least Apple's the only company that makes its hardware.  It's much more like a PC in the sense there.  You know, Google's more like Microsoft here.  But making a reference platform, as well as giving this operating system  to a lot of other people so that they can make the hardware.  But I think in the long run, that's a better model.  I mean, look at the variety and choice that you have in the PC world  compared to what you have in the Mac world.  And I think in the long run, that's a more open and a better model.  Although, you know, Apple does get some benefit by controlling everything so tightly.  Obviously, Google doesn't want to do that.  It's really clear that they're just making a reference here.  This is this is what we think you should do or could do.  I bet they put everything in here that they've got.  I'm sure that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah.  How many people have you heard who said,  Jake, your son Jake is one of these that he'd rather wait for the Verizon version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. And that's not long  far from now, apparently sometime this this quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this spring, I think it's a smart move.  I mean, you know, for T-Mobile isn't the best isn't the best network out there.  In fact, I can't I can't get a location signal from my from my home.  So I actually considered like, oh, maybe this T-Mobile choice wasn't the best one.  But so now that the Verizon version, though, is going to be the CDMA version.  Right. It's not going to be. Yes.  So there's going to be a GSM version and a CDMA version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember that, you know, this Qualcomm chipset and Qualcomm is a big CDMA company.  So I don't think that's a problem at all.  In fact, that might be that that might be kind of the natural thing for it to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a different device.  I mean, so consumers have to understand.  Do you think most consumers understand the difference between GSM and CDMA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, no, I think they do.  I think they do. I mean, I don't think they know maybe all the details,  but I think that they know that there's something  fundamentally different from a phone designed for the Verizon network  and the T-Mobile network.  And at what the very least, they know is you get a phone to go with your cell phone company.  Although, again, this was an interesting conversation with the Google folks.  They said they didn't like that, that, you know, they said in the past,  which is the present, that's just the Google lives in the future.  In the past, before you could buy a phone, the first question you'd ask is,  well, who's your carrier?  You can only buy you can only buy this phone, this phone or this phone if it's Verizon.  And I think people know that.  I think their goal is to change that and to make it possible.  They were very clear with me.  We do not want the Nexus one to be a T-Mobile phone.  We want the Nexus one to be an every every carrier phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the CDMA GSM issue, like if they're truly trying to couple  the phones from the carriers, then suddenly it's on the consumer to understand,  like, I need a CDMA phone if I want Verizon, but I want a GSM phone  if I want T-Mobile. And they're two different answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you ordered, you went there and said, what network you want to run on?  Right. You just couldn't select Verizon.  But it was I think that's pretty I don't think that's so complicated.  What network do you want to run on?  Well, let's see, I'd like to have a contract with Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I mean, but if we're trying to get to a point where there isn't a contract, right?  Where I say I want I want a phone and whatever SIM I have laying around,  I want to be able to pop it in.  I mean, that's I mean, maybe I'm well, that's a crazy thing to think.  That's GSM.  But I mean, could you imagine working like Europe where you can just get a pay  as you go, Sam, walk into a corner store and get a card with throw some money on it,  put it in your phone and it works like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could happen with T-Mobile on this phone now, which is why about the unlocked.  Right. The same in Europe.  But the irony of this is, Gina, why I read one story,  I didn't put it in the feed, so I can't remember where that said that.  When the end when the next one comes to Europe,  it's going to be the American model. You're stuck with the vendor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a surprise. That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to cause a storm over there.  But, you know, here's what I fear.  Well, don't fear it. It's today.  Right now today, I want to have a Mifi.  I want to have my phone.  I want to have probably a car that has a cell connection.  I want to have  the tablet or whatever the heck it is from Apple.  I'm not going to have four or five.  I'm not Leola Port.  I'm not going to have four or five separate phone bills coming in.  My wife will divorce me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't show them to my wife. That's the key.  And as long as we're talking, can I pay some bills right now?  Let's let's talk about GoToMeeting.  The great folks at Citrix told me, you know, you don't have to go to CES.  You could just do the show via GoToMeeting.  That's the idea, right, is do more, travel less with GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting is that great online meeting software from the folks at Citrix.  One hundred twenty eight bit encrypted, so it's secure.  Twenty four seven support.  So you always have the help you need.  And by the way, about as easy to install as you can get.  In fact, I want you to try it right now.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig, GoToMeeting.com slash TWIG.  And you could try 30 days free of GoToMeeting.  Unlimited meetings, built in voice over internet, built in teleconferencing, all free.  The cost for the whole bundle, just forty nine dollars a month.  That's a heck of a lot cheaper than one trip to Vegas.  And I tell you, it's a lot more effective, a lot more engaging.  I want you to give it a try.  They've supported us, but they brought us down here, by the way.  We thank them for their support and we encourage you to give it a try.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  The best way to have your online meetings.  So now, see, now I can get another phone.  Let's see, what should I pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny, there are, you know, this you, Leo, carrying a purse.  Phone rings, you hit five different pockets.  That's true. Then your purse, then your briefcase,  try to figure out which one is ringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, thank goodness for Google Voice.  I only give out that Google Voice number, so they all ring at the same time.  It's like being in a Swiss clock shop at noon.  It's very disconcerting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like a Swiss cow, everyone can hear you coming.  Ding dong dong, ding dong dong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, speaking of Google Voice, it was really easy for me  to just buy a new plan.  My old plan was kind of was ending anyway.  But because I had Google Voice, I had all my, you know, you know, I logged in  and I had all my voicemail and all my text messages on my phone.  My phone number didn't change.  I, you know, I didn't have to tell any of my friends like, hey, I got a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, somebody who moved from a Droid phone told me it also picks up your  wallpaper and stuff.  So Google's paying attention.  Now, that's actually a little scary.  They're paying attention to how you configure your phone.  And when you add a new Android phone, it says, oh, well, we'll just configure  it exactly the same.  So it's interesting.  If that's true, I haven't confirmed it.  That's a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an option to back up your phone settings.  That is true. And I wondered what that was.  I didn't know what that meant.  But so now that makes sense.  So it saves your it saves your probably saves your wallpaper and your bookmarks.  So I imagine that the bookmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, dare I say it, Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  Without without the overhead of iTunes.  I mean, iTunes does that.  But it's you know, that's kind of a negative.  It's on that PC. I like the idea of Google keeping all my data.  But I wonder if it's going to scare people as it did me at first.  Well, what else are they keeping track of? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. Did you?  There's also very tight Facebook integration on the on the.  Oh, really? The Nexus one.  Yeah. So the Facebook application comes preinstalled as does Google Voice.  But so the Facebook application becomes preinstalled.  And I don't use Facebook very much, but I logged in just to check it out.  And it can sync all your contacts with it.  You can grab your their Facebook photos and their statuses.  So if I tap a contact to call that person, I can see their latest Facebook status  and their in their photo from Facebook.  In the contacts application, which is pretty cool.  And you can also put a Facebook phone book on your on your home screen.  So you can you can tap a folder and see all your Facebook contacts and call one of them  based on so Facebook essentially becomes your cloud based phone book, which is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm flashing on the idea that next Facebook is going to have the Facebook phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. Powered by Google. Yeah. Yeah.  There was another story at the party that I was very shocked.  Chris Messina just took a job at Google.  Chris is yeah. Yeah. Chris is the open source.  Oh, advocate. He was working for a while for Firefox supporting that.  And in fact, had worked with Facebook to open Facebook a little bit.  And so, you know, he's really been kind of an independent guy helping other people.  Did it say what what his job is going to be at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a I was with Dave Weiner for breakfast this week,  and he said the machine is going to be an evangelist for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's Chris's job, really. He is an evangelist. Yeah.  You know, but if if if what Facebook is doing and with Google and what Google's  doing with Facebook, it would make sense to have somebody like Chris Messina  involved because of his work in OpenID and OAuth.  It would make a lot of sense for them to hire somebody like this is respected  in the community who's worked with both companies,  maybe to bridge that gap.  His his his job is technically called open web advocate,  which is what he's been all along as an advocate of the open web.  But but from from Google's point of view, maybe the open web means interoperability,  maybe it means OAuth. It's interesting.  He was at Vidup, which is the open ID company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when I was talking to Dave for breakfast this week,  two things came together in my mind.  The discussion we've been having about the desire to back up all your stuff  in a place that's safe for you, whether that's in a vendor you trust  or whether that's on your own machine and to do that across platforms.  And and the idea of the data liberation front.  Dave was also talking about the idea of keeping things for a long time.  His his late father as a web presence.  And it just hit me that the two really become together.  She wanted to know that your stuff, that the representation of you online  and the things you use while you're here to use them are all safe somewhere.  And that's a key definition of what an open web means, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Messina in his blog said that he kind of put out feelers saying  he wanted to work for a big company.  He thought it would be fun to work for Google, but was told, well,  Google pretty much only hires engineers, which is for the most part true.  They don't really hire evangelists per se.  So he said he kind of gave up on it.  He went in for an interview and two weeks later,  they made me a great offer, letting me do what I was already doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jesus, two weeks.  I thought it took a list, you know, three months of going through the gauntlet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to get a job. Normally you have many, many callbacks, many interviews.  It's it's a it is a the running the gauntlet is exactly what  what the experience is, at least according to the people I've talked to,  have tried to get jobs at Google. It's hard.  So congratulations to Chris Messina.  I think that's interesting.  We'll try to get him on the show if they'll let him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that'd be wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be wonderful. Very nice guy.  And I think a good move for Google.  So let me tell you in just a second about some of the Android devices  I saw, including one that could be a game changer in the ebook field.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  You're listening to This Week in Google with Jeff Jarvis,  Gina Trapani and me. I'm Leo Laporte live from CES  and brought to you by our trip to CES, brought to you by, as I mentioned,  Ford and Citrix and one more sponsor, Audible.com, the great audio book source.  I listen to audio books all the time from Audible.  When I flew down here, I was listening.  When I drive to the airport, I'm listening.  When I'm at the gym, I'm listening.  The best thing is you can get, you know, listening done.  You can get reading done in those times which normally be completely lost to you.  And when you add them all up, I probably spend two or three hours a day  reading through Audible.com. And that's pretty cool.  I want you to check it out. Go to Audible.com slash Twig,  A U D I B L E dot com slash Twig.  You could sign up for the gold account.  That's going to give you a book a month and your first one's absolutely free.  You get to keep it even if you cancel and you can cancel it anytime.  Audible.com slash Twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google  and for our trip to Las Vegas for CES.  So one of the things I saw when I was down here is a new ebook reader  called The Entourage Edge.  You can go to Entourage Edge dot com and take a look.  They have a really great demo.  This is I don't know if you ever saw the video Microsoft put out of their  concept ebook reader called The Courier.  It was more like a book. It had two pages, two facing pages.  The left page was E Ink.  And this is this is exactly the same thing, by the way.  It's exactly what it looks like.  It's a it's almost a 10 inch E Ink screen.  Nine point seven inches, twelve hundred by eight twenty five.  They've done some interesting things. They've added touch to it.  They have a Wacom digitizer on the E Ink.  So you can write notes on it and so forth.  It reads EPUB files and PDFs.  EPUB means it gives it access to the entire Google Book Library.  They've also say they also say they've made some content deals.  But on the right hand side, there's an Android netbook,  a 1024 by 600 pixel, 10 inch screen running Android in full color.  You can drag images from the E Ink side to the Android side.  And in fact, if that image was in color in the original,  even though it's in black and white on the ebook,  it will turn into a color image on the Android side.  There's a video camera built in and you can record still images  or MPEG for videos using it.  It's got headphones.  You could do I imagine you could do Skype.  You could do anything you could on an Android.  It's going to have a one gigahertz Snapdragon very much like your Nexus one.  So in a way, it's like a big 10 inch screen Nexus one.  I think this is a really cool device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it cost as much as the Lincoln you were driving this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was my first question.  Guess how much?  Four hundred ninety dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's less than the Nexus one.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Less than the Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's less than the Nexus one.  Well, it's got no phone in it.  It's not a phone.  But this is this kind of stunned me.  And I think part of the reason they could charge so little is I guess they probably  don't have to pay for Android, right?  This is a remarkable device.  I played with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it use cell connectivity or just Wi-Fi connectivity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it has. Let me see.  Yes, no, I'm sorry.  It has built in Wi-Fi and future support, whatever that means for 3G using  EVDR and HSDPA mobile modem.  So right now it's Wi-Fi only.  It has Bluetooth so you can use an external keyboard.  You can download books via Wi-Fi.  You could send email from the Android side, browse the web on the Android side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So with a Wi-Fi you can use it as a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And they're aiming at the college market.  They think students...  Because it's really too big to sit in bed and read it.  It's too heavy. It's three pounds.  And you know, so you're not going to hold it up while you're lying in bed, but it  replaces textbooks.  That's the whole point of it.  I think this was a stunning product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the brand again, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can look at it.  Entourageedge.com.  Entourageedge.com.  They're selling it now.  They're taking orders now.  It comes in blue, black, red, white or ice blue, midnight blue or ice blue for  $490 and ships next month.  This was, you know, now there's, you know, it's a little clunky.  The bezel is a little bit big and so forth.  They're calling it a dual book.  They do have New York Times bestsellers in their store.  I mean, they've got, somehow they've got deals.  I don't know where these guys came from.  The interesting thing is they're just one of about a dozen ebook readers here and a  lot of Android products.  Really interesting.  A lot of netbooks and that kind of thing.  So, you know, I am getting excited about the notion of Android going beyond the  phone, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to bite the hand that feeds us, but there's also an Android system for cars  that was being shown out there.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes sense.  You know, I would imagine there's no reason why Ford wouldn't, you know, at some  point use Android as its OS.  The OS isn't necessarily the killer sauce.  It's how they integrate it with the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So we didn't, we did our predictions last year, last episode for 2010.  Or did we?  Did we, did we, did we get to predictions?  I think we looked back.  We didn't look forward so much.  But the Google OS blog, Google system dot blogspot dot com did their  predictions for 2010 and some interesting predictions.  They said bookmark sync will extend to sync documents and Google docs.  That seems like it would make sense.  Google will launch a service that indexes and ranks web applications.  I don't know why they think they'll do that, but why not?  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's right.  I think that's, that's the filter failure problem there.  And if you want to organize things that are disorganized, there's a key opportunity  right there and it needs to be organized in a different way.  It's not information.  It's applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess you're right.  I mean, and after all, a lot of applications are just information.  There's, I mean, the distinction between applications and information is kind of  nebulous anyway.  Right.  Um, search engine will start grouping related results.  That would be very nice.  I think that would be great.  Google image search will let you upload an image and then show related images from  the web.  That's just Google goggles.  That makes sense.  Searchable street view images.  I love that idea.  Um, Android will have more users in windows mobile.  I think that's pretty obvious.  Yeah, that's right on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, they're going to launch now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought this was kind of interesting.  A Google drive, a drive in the sky.  Uh, but it will be an ex they say an extended version of Google docs, instead  of sending attachments as many people do.  They, you could use Gmail as a file.  There's a Gmail file system.  I think it would make sense to have a Google drive.  Why not?  Um, Google will buy true knowledge and launch a fact search engine.  Maybe they'll buy Wolfram alpha.  That'd be kind of interesting.  Google will buy Spotify and make it available for free.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, just some more.  I saw a lot of people cheer that idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a free part.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love that, but not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to, uh, I think it's time for our, we got to wrap this up because I  know we're keeping you a little late.  We had some technical issues.  We're going to have to do a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a  technical issues here on this end from Vegas.  And so we're a delayed and we want to get Twitter under way in a second.  So I'll tell you what, let's get our, uh, tip, our number and our tool of the  week, starting with Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Cool.  So in honor of the Nexus one launch this week, my tip is for Android users.  Uh, you know, Android Leo has said a couple of times, Android has only a  limited number of home screens, uh, three or five, depending on your version, but  you can create folders on your, on your Android home screen and, and  organize your icons in them.  So, um, if you tap and hold your home screen, you get the option to add  objects to that home screen.  One of them is a folder.  You can add a new folder and put icons into it.  So I'll give you an example of how I use this.  Um, I, when I go to the gym, I use certain things on my phone.  I have a workout playlist and I have this app that tracks how far I run.  And I use a stopwatch app and I have a bookmark to a program I'm using.  Well, I created a folder called gym and I moved all those icons into  that folder.  So whenever I go to the gym, I tap the folder, open it up, and I've got all  my kind of gym specific icons in there.  So it's not the same as having unlimited home screens, but it does give you this  nice option of organizing your, uh, your shortcuts into kind of, you know,  subgroups that you can name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So does the, uh, Nexus one have three or five homepages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Nexus one has five.  Yay.  Yup.  Yeah.  I knew you'd be happy about that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the thing that most bugs me the most.  And I'm so, I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really needed, I really needed more space, but the folders will help too.  Cause then I can, you know, that's one thing that I use pages for in the iPhone  is organizing, uh, icons or applications into, into, you know, chunks that I would.  So this would, this is a good way to do that.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Good tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I'm still confused.  This is, this is, this is me giving myself an IQ test and failing here, but  the difference between the home screens and the little grid at the bottom down  here, what's the, what's the logical difference between those two things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you tap the grid, the application menu launches.  So think about, think of that as like your Windows start button.  It's everything.  I know I hate to make that analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so then what do you call it when you put it on the home screen?  Is that a shortcut?  Is that a what?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you, if you drag and drop an application from that menu onto your home  screen, that just means it's on your home screen and you can, you know, you can  access it just like your desktop, just like putting icons on your Mac desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that's a really good analogy.  And that's why I hated having five.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll become a remedial lesson later.  I was, I was having problems getting on the thing and people were telling me in  Twitter, ask Gina,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you the walkthrough for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, just, I don't understand why you're having difficulty with that.  Jeff, you've got one, you've got a drawer that has everything in it.  And then you could select the things you use a lot and move those of the, the top  pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand why you need both.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause cause.  Oh, why you need both.  Well, it's the difference.  Oh, that's true.  So the iPhone really doesn't have, it's a difference between the doc on the iPhone  and your home screen.  There you go.  Kind of kind of like you put, you put the things on your doc, right?  That you use all the time, right?  And those are always there.  It's been a while.  I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  one thing that does bug me is that you've got the grid and you've got the menu and  they both come from the same place.  Now, didn't they change that now on, on 2.1?  Does it, does the, that always bug me.  So you press the menu button and you get your settings menu, but the same, it  slides up from the same place that the, the applications menu slides up from.  Is it, is it the same on the Nexus one?  They're both from the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, well, yeah, the menu is kind of settings.  Yeah, it is the same thing.  So there's like the, like their list of applications.  I find more confusing because yeah, yeah, it's, I can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That, that bugs me a little bit, but that, you know, that's just life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that I find a little confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally not just you, Jeff.  I should say I love Android, but I can totally see how it is sort of confusing  to, you know, confusing to new users.  In fact, Matt Howey wrote a great long review about all things that made him  like really confused about Android when he first started using it.  Um, and so, and he, you know, he's a total nerd.  So I'm right there with you.  The initial experience is not, is still not as good.  It's still not as simple and easy to, easy to grok.  I'll stick with it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hang in there.  I think it might become more, more, more acceptable.  It's not, there are some edges that are not polished, but if you're comparing it  to the iPhone, that's a pretty high standard.  Sure.  A heck of a lot better than Windows mobile or even Blackberry or webOS.  I mean, I think it's a really nice phone.  I'm seeing also that it syncs with Picasso web albums too.  So you can get your photos in from Picasso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  If you go in a gallery, it's, it syncs to your Picasso web albums, which is pretty,  which is pretty cool, pretty neat and new syncing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really, that's wonderful.  That's wonderful.  I think I'm going to, I don't know if I'll replace the iPhone, but I think it's going  to be, I'm very excited about getting one.  That's cool.  Now it's time for Jeff's number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well, we'll try start with seven out of 10.  That's how many, uh, Google users make more than one query a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is, I'm so glad I stayed away from that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, I told you, I put it in the subject line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's awfully, because it is such a great article.  It's some of the Google blog.  Uh, it is wonderful.  It's like a Harper's indirect and Harper's index of stats from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So a real quick proportion of users in the U S making more than twin 10  queries a day, one out of seven, a fraction of queries, duplicates, et cetera.  Never seen before more than one third of queries are unique.  Isn't that amazing?  Um,  that's hard to believe.  Greatest increase Indonesia, um, average amount of time taken by  users to finish a query nine seconds.  Average amount of time it takes Google to answer less than one quarter of a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's some crazy numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's impressive.  Impressive.  And my tool of the week is the Google translate element.  I've always thought that Google's translation was really good.  And a lot of websites now kind of build that in and Google has made this  available for a websites.  They just did this right before the end of the year.  You go to google.com slash web elements slash translate.  You can easily add a little Google translate button on any website blog and  make it possible for your website to be read by people all over the world in any  of the Google languages.  And there are quite a few languages.  Uh, I don't think pirate is on here, but, uh, Yiddish is Welsh,  Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Thai, Turkish, Swedish, Swahili, Spanish, and on and  on.  And what a nice way to make it very easy for web sites to make their site  accessible to everybody.  So google.com if you're a web guy, I'm going to do this on my blog.  I think it's such a great idea.  Google.com slash web elements slash translate easily add Google  translate to your site.  It's an, I think Google translate does a fairly good job for machine translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really made me very lazy.  The same as I can't spell anymore.  All my efforts to finally late in life, learn my bad German have gone away  because now when I need a word, I just go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I do that with French.  I know it's not so good.  In fact, sometimes you get some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other neat little trick is I gave a talk to a bunch of Dutch people a while  ago and I looked up and, and when I started on Skype, I said dunk and they  applauded that because I went to the effort, right?  So I had some Norwegians want me to come speak to them.  So I was honored that they did that.  And I went to Google.  I asked, how do you say many, thanks.  And I put in money talk in that.  And that amazed them too.  So it's a nice little trick to use Google translate to impress, you  know, future mothers-in-law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just don't say you should be nine or Linner and you'll be all right.  My other tool I decided not to do is a Google map mashup called pot locator.  That lets you find the medical marijuana dispensary near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you're there in Vegas, you have a variation on it.  I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  If you're in need, pot locator.com is a good use of, of Google maps.  All right, everybody.  We thank you so much for being here.  I apologize for my, my throat and my hoarseness.  We'll be back in studio next week with this week in Google and some fun  guests, maybe get Christmas scene on.  There's a lot of people I have in mind.  There's some really wonderful people from Google too, that we'd like to get on.  But you can find this show at twit.tv slash twig.  It's on iTunes.  It's on the zoom stores, even on iGoogle.  You can add it to your iGoogle page.  If you just go to twit.tv slash twig, watch it on YouTube, youtube.com slash  twit, and you can watch live normally at two 15 Pacific five 15 Eastern  every Saturday at live.twit.tv.  Jeff Jarvis is a blogging at buzz machine.com.  So great to have you, Jeff.  Thanks for being here.  Thanks for putting up with a lousy connection from Vegas.  Gina Trapani blogs at smarterware.org.  And you can also see her work in life hacker and the Harvard business review.  And you might catch her bicycling around San Diego.  If you look fast with her Nexus one.  Thank you everybody for being here.  We'll see you next time on twig.
