The Tau School of Journalism and the beautiful Manhattan campus.  Of the City University of New York.  And look at this studio.  Wait a minute.  He's senior on Wences, ladies and gentlemen.  There he is.  This is so pro, Jeff. I can't take it.  Wow.  Amazing, huh?  And so tell us a little bit.  This was something that you and your dean.  Sarah Bartlett.  Sarah Bartlett have been pitching for some time.  I think you got some grant money to do it.  Yes, we did.  And we are going to become the East Coast outlet for twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And do a show here coming up in the spring.  On the New York tech scene.  On the twit network.  Thanks to Luke.  And the people who are watching.  Thanks to Leo and company.  And we're very excited.  And so this is from our studio that we have here.  Behind me is the newsroom.  It's empty today because classes start on Friday.  But we'll fix up lighting and things and do other stuff.  We wanted to test today whether or not we could have a decent conversation.  A decent picture.  And Leo is ecstatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you surprise me.  I didn't know you were ready.  And we're using the Comrex live stream.  Live shot.  Which is interesting.  Because this is the public internet.  Much like Skype.  But we're pouring more bandwidth into it.  About 6 megabits.  So as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've done a lot of adjustments to get the latency down.  So it's less than 200 milliseconds, right?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 140 milliseconds from me to you.  200 milliseconds from you to me.  So the round trip is less than half a second.  Which is more than adequate for a two-way conversation.  No more pink Jeff.  Well, we'll still get you when you go to your house.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you look like you should be on Meet the Press.  Or, I don't know, Anderson.  Where's Anderson Cooper when we need him?  This is good.  This is really great.  So thank you, Jeff.  We appreciate it.  You did a nice thing for us.  You're back from Davos.  But while you were in Davos, you reached out to Jonathan Abrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we've had such chatter about AMP on the show.  And you and Jonathan had some talk about it on Twitter.  And we don't want to talk to Jonathan about more than just AMP.  But this is a chance to get together with Jonathan.  And I'm a big fan of Nuzzle.  I visited him there.  And so we can talk to Jonathan.  Jonathan's a major entrepreneur.  Joining us now, the founder and CEO of Nuzzle, Jonathan Abrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is, you may know the name.  It may ring a bell.  We did a triangulation episode with Jonathan.  He was the founder of Friendster, the very first massive social network.  And I'll never forget, it was in tech TV days.  We were doing a tech live on the set.  And I remember somebody saying, have you seen this thing called Friendster?  I think it was Kat Schwartz, who was my co-host on Call for Help.  What Friendster?  What's that?  She said, oh, you add your friends and you talk with them.  And I don't think we were aware of Facebook at the time.  I think if it was around, it was because this is 2000.  What year was that, Jonathan?  2000, 1999?  2003, that late.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that early.  Only Facebook.  Facebook did not exist then.  It did not exist.  But I remember being on tech TV a few times.  Some of the tech TV folks were pretty early.  Oh, I was.  In fact, I remember getting on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we talked about it.  We brought it down.  We couldn't get on.  It was really exciting.  Actually, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I was on with Sarah Lane.  And she put it up on the screen and we were having problems with it loading.  Immediately.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twit power.  Well, tech TV power, which has been translated to twit power.  That's right.  Really cool stuff.  And I think, I mean, it's clear, you're kind of the John the Baptist of social media.  You paved the way for what was to come.  I don't think you got beheaded.  However, it was for many of us our first experience and it was a revelation of what social media could be.  So we owe you a lot.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, thanks for having me on the show.  It's good to see you again and good to see Jeff again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you rest on your laurels?  I'm sure, I mean, MySpace Tom is just hanging out his mansion.  Sure.  I'm not kidding.  Nice guy.  I met him, hung out with him and Trey Radcliffe is great.  But, you know, he's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm an engineer.  I like to build things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you continued on.  Actually, I think we have.  Glad you did.  Thanks to YouTube.  We can relive those heady days early on.  This is Sarah Lane at your Friendster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hottest thing online right now where you meet people through people that you already know.  That's right.  We printed out our Friendster list.  We can track down some of these friends.  We're going to see if our online Friendsters can be our real friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Morgan Webb, Sarah Lane, Kat Schwartz, Jessica Corbin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're dressed like that apartment you showed earlier, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Decorated.  2003, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that Max Lipchin?  Yeah, probably.  That's James Hong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How many Friendsters do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My name is Molly and I have 170 Friendsters.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  170 Friendsters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you dated any of these friends?  Yeah, I just dated one last week.  Really great.  He's a physicist from Stanford.  This is Tim.  We've been talking online for a while now and he said he's going to be here.  Let's see if he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is before Tinder, before Facebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you Tim?  No, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know Tim?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that Matt Marshall, the founder of VentureBeat?  You probably recognize all these people.  Not all.  A long time ago.  I want to see Jonathan Abrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was the founder of VentureBeat.  I'm about 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On your Friendster, do you put single or in a relationship?  I'm singles, definitely.  You're out there to meet some guys?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How many Friends does the founder of Friendster have?  There you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Almost 200, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He only has two in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Wow.  That's a time capsule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you to whoever found that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friendster's gone though, right?  There's no Friendster left.  Well, the funny thing is, as is often the case with the press, they tell the same story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  over and over again.  Friendster was reported to have died many, many, many times when it had not.  It was acquired in 2009.  Then the Asian company that owned it sort of refocused on social gaming.  And the weird thing is, very recently they seemed to have shut down the site.  So let's see.  It's like, I don't know, five, six years after they bought it.  And I don't think that got a lot of coverage in the press.  But the irony is that there had been many times in many previous years when they had  reported that Friendster had died or shut down when it had not.  It went through June of last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it was the Abe Vagoda of services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's mean.  Poor Abe.  Well, everybody thought it was dead.  By the way, may Abe Vagoda rest in peace.  I'm saying this as the name of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love Abe Vagoda.  He was an Internet meme for longer than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was at People Magazine when he was declared dead.  Well, I started Friendster in 2002.  And if it shut down in 2015, it's still at 13 years.  That's good.  It's a long time on the Internet.  It's 150 years Internet time or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When was that, Jeff, that you were at Entertainment Weekly?  So it was a long time ago that people thought Abe Vagoda had...  It was at People before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so a story went through about Abe Vagoda.  And a top editor put in the late Abe Vagoda.  And the fact checkers, this is why we had fact checkers,  take that out and said, no, Abe Vagoda.  And then it went back to the editor again.  And he said the late Abe Vagoda.  And it went into print that way.  And this is my favorite part of the story, of course,  is that the next week, Abe Vagoda took out a full-page ad  in variety of himself sitting up in a coffin reading people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's convincing.  Abe Vagoda, of course, fish from Barney Miller,  but also before that, Tessio from The Godfather.  And the meme ended up with a website, AbeVagoda.com,  where you could go.  And in fact, I went when I saw on Twitter  that Mr. Vagoda had passed away.  I went there and it still said he was alive.  Somebody tweeted, I think Kodrosky tweeted,  you had one job.  And then the site went down.  And it's come back with a sad, that's terrible.  That's terrible.  Fish sleeps with the fishes.  Anyway, so anyway, thank you for Friendster.  I think you did a wonderful job.  Somebody told me that as of 2010,  Facebook purchased some of your patents, which is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So after Friendster was sold to a company in Asia,  that company in turn sold all the patents to Facebook  for more than they paid to acquire Friendster.  It was sort of the final chapter of the bizarre mismanagement of Friendster.  So yeah, now Facebook owns all the patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apologies, it was Patrick Delahanty in our own office  who passed along this tweet.  You had one job.  Can you pull it up?  Jason, are you distracted?  Are you busy back there?  You doing something?  I'm sorry.  You had one job, AbeVagoda.com.  Rest in peace, Abe.  Thank you, Patrick.  I want to give, he works on our staff,  so I want to give him credit for that.  But enough of the past.  Let's talk about Nuzle.  Did you have stuff in between, Jonathan, that you worked on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In between Friendster and Nuzle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so after Friendster, I had a startup called Socializer  that was competitive to Evite.  And much, much better than Evite,  but that turns out to be a really horrible market.  So we merged with another player in that space,  and I was sort of glad to get out of helping people  manage their party invites,  because that turned out to be a huge headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Evite learned, as everybody learned, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People would call us up and say,  you've ruined my party, nobody's gotten my invitations.  Then we'd look in our database and see that people had received it,  and they were just lying.  They didn't want to go.  Because it turns out that people tell the host,  oh, no, I didn't get the invitation if they just don't want to go.  So that was kind of a frustrating market.  And then after that, I started Founder's Den and then Nuzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Founder's Den, of course.  A great place. That's in San Francisco, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, so I'm coming at you from the beautiful conference room at Founder's Den.  Went in here to get some quiet.  And I'm looking right out the window at Soma in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Founder's Den is a shared workspace,  but it was a little controversial because it's also a private club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it was controversial,  but it's also meant to be a bit of a private community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Controversial only among those who couldn't get in.  Maybe that's better said that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's not like a country club where we're excluding people.  It's really more meant to have been a curated experience,  because there's a lot of co-working spaces in San Francisco.  And for the most part, you walk in with the check and they'll rent you a desk.  And we wanted to create something that was a little bit more of a curated community,  not to exclude people, but really to foster more of a sense of community.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also adds value, I think.  General Assembly kind of did the same thing where you had to compete to get in,  and when you knew you were in, that meant something about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Founder's Den is a pretty unique place.  I mean, you can walk in here and you're going to see just sitting around  or having their meetings, you're going to see people like Gavin Newsom,  Gil Pinchina, Jay Adelson, Charles Hudson.  So other people in the industry, I think, feel like they fit in.  This is a cool place for them to take a meeting a lot better than going to a Starbucks.  And people can come in here to meet somebody,  and then they end up often bumping into somebody else that they haven't seen in a while,  some other VC or entrepreneur who they're really pleased to catch up with.  So it's kind of a special community.  But ultimately, it is a shared office space,  and we've had companies like Winnelo and Docker and Datasift, Socialcam, Kaggle,  all sorts of companies, and of course this is where Nuzle itself is headquartered.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis was here a couple of weeks ago,  and he said, really, San Francisco is going to be, it's the new Florence.  It's the new center of the world.  I'm sure you, Jeff, would not agree.  That's why we're going to do a New York startup scene.  Oh, jeez.  Jason's ego meets San Francisco's ego.  No, but he put his money where his mouth is.  He moved from LA to be in San Francisco, because he, and I think he's not far wrong.  I mean, and there is a magic that happens because you can have these conversations,  because everybody is kind of trying to solve the same problems, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeff.  New York Tech scene is where real business is, real people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say that in Austin and Seattle, too.  30 inches of snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have to walk through 30 inches of snow.  So it matters here, and our bare feet, because we're tough in New York.  We're not like you wimps out there who take your little fluffy buses down to your jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I shoveled enough snow in my day.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you from the New York area, Jonathan?  Canada.  Canada?  Mm-hmm.  That was real snow.  Yep.  So let's talk about Nuzzle, because I have to say, there were others.  Brad Cross at Google created another social news, right at the same time, news idea.  I'm sorry, Brad, I forgot the name already.  But it was IU joined it and a few of the others.  But Nuzzle, I think it's very clear, you did everything right with Nuzzle,  and Nuzzle stands alone now, and everybody I know in my business uses Nuzzle.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's really, really good.  And loves Nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And loves it.  I think that what we're doing is unique.  So the interesting thing is people have been building personalized news aggregation tools for a long time.  There were a lot of things that predated this in Silicon Valley.  And in fact, just like some other things I've worked on,  news personalization and aggregation are one of the things that I think Silicon Valley people like to build over and over again.  But they're almost always too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prismatic. That's what Brad's startup was.  And they pivoted away.  There's some secret sauce.  The way Nuzzle works is you sign up using your Twitter or Facebook account.  You will then link also your other social media accounts.  Is it just still Twitter and Facebook?  Have you got others in there now too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in November, we launched what we called Nuzzle 2.0,  and it was a huge new release for us that now,  in addition to the experience that you and Jeff use,  where you log in with Twitter and you just by virtual of connecting your graph from Twitter,  get automatically personalized relevant news using that.  As of November, the 2.0 brings a new experience for people who don't use Twitter.  And you can now go to Nuzzle on iPhone, Android or Web.  I love that.  You can discover feeds that other people have created and you can search and you can fave feeds.  So for example, somebody could go and just say, OK, I like Jeff Jarvis's feed,  and I want to get that via email or I want to get that via push or I want to look at that on the Web or I want to have that as a tab in my iPhone or Android app.  Because Jeff Jarvis, he knows how to use Twitter and he's followed a lot of interesting people.  And I'm interested in the world of journalism and online news.  And Jeff Jarvis's feed is going to be giving me very relevant stuff.  I'm just going to use that.  So as of November, there's a whole new experience around faving feeds, discovering feeds,  searching that is available to people who don't necessarily log in with a social media account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it, Jeff. Did you notice this? Google thinks your feed is in German.  Would you like to translate it?  You got to stop posting these foreign language articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, look at the German first, Spanish next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But both of them writing about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This one is the other Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  I like that. German, German, German.  I'm going to stop following this guy. He doesn't post in English anymore.  This is because you were at Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess because what Jonathan must have presumed I was in German and then pick German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is this is actually not Jeff's feed.  This is a search result. Oh, so you're looking.  So at the top is a search result showing Jeff's feed.  Yeah. Hello. That are stories that have the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why it says stories. I guess I get it. OK.  So this could be also used as a way to search for topics.  Absolutely. Oh, interesting. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can get feeds of topics.  So I've talked to some news organizations saying that that you could use Nuzle to say that if you want to have a feed of all of the, you know,  Cleveland Browns stuff, you can use Nuzle because basically people have picked the people who pick the good stuff.  Right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think ultimately Nuzle is moving in the direction of being more than just a news aggregation app that people are using for their own value,  which people use it that way and love it.  But we're I think evolving beyond that to also being a platform where people can create feeds.  And we think that that's a very sort of interesting thing.  We've created a few hundred feeds to showcase the two point to functionality.  We launched November, but ultimately we think in the long run, the feeds will be created by media companies and experts and organizations and nonprofits and  all sorts of people or companies that have an interest in certain topic and they could use Nuzle to create feeds on those topics or around a specific community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I apologize because I've been completely misusing us all this time.  I just I just thought it was a great stream.  Well, partly it's testament to the fact that you do that basic core functionality so well.  I've never looked beyond the three tabs news from your friends, news from friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to people are going to use Nuzle in different ways.  The two point experience. We only launched that two months ago.  So that that's new. So you're not that far behind.  But, you know, you logged in with your Twitter account and therefore you can use Nuzle just the way you've been using it.  And that's delivering great value to you.  But we also wanted to move in the direction of supporting people who aren't necessarily Twitter power users.  And and, you know, those kind of people, perhaps somebody who was Twitter, Twitter would like to do to write.  Sure. And so somebody maybe doesn't use Twitter, but is a fan of Leo's and is interested in Leo's world.  Maybe they will fave Leo's feed in the app or maybe they'll subscribe to Leo's Nuzle newsletter.  But that is a way that we can extend the power of social creation to a broader audience so that everybody can can benefit from that.  So that but, you know, that stuff is relatively relatively new.  Like I said, the two point launch was in November just a week before Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what's cool about this is it leverages work that I've done on other social sites.  I don't really have to really do anything because the last thing anybody wants is another site where you have to make lists and and then create content.  It's like Flipboard is always saying, would you like to make a magazine? No, I don't.  I don't want to make a magazine. I just want to read those stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. One of our fundamental philosophies for Nuzle was that people shouldn't have to do work.  We didn't want to say, OK, come to Nuzle and then enter a list of topics you're interested in.  And we didn't want people to have to train it by looking at irrelevant content before we start delivering relevant content.  We just didn't believe that people want to do those kind of things.  So we started off by tapping into your existing social graphs to provide instantly relevant content with no work.  Now what we're trying to do is figure out ways that other people can also get that power of social creation.  So while most people don't have to do any work and create a list, if a small number of people do create a list, Nuzle can turn that into something that then a million other people can just consume without them having to do any work.  So, for example, Mark Andreessen created an economics Twitter list that is automatically turned by Nuzle into a news feed of really interesting economics news.  And anybody in the world can subscribe to that.  And, you know, they don't have to do any work.  They can just say I want to do economics.  They subscribe to that.  They are doing no work.  They're just going to get good content.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And how do I find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've got a I've got a media Twitter media wants list.  So the same thing exists there.  So it already exists in Nuzle.  It should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as of November, when we added search.  So now if you go to Nuzle via Android, iPhone or Web and you search for media wants, hopefully that will pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's worked for me because I see all these lists that my feeds I've created, which I never created, but it pulled those from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And like I said, you know, in the long run, we'd like organizations to to create great feeds.  So it could be a journalism school.  It could be ESPN.  It could be Hillary Clinton campaign.  It could be Disney.  It could be anybody.  You know, people can use this to create feeds on topics or on communities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels like you've learned a lot from your previous startups about how to build features in how to almost in a way go slow and build thoughtfully.  That's what it feels like to me.  Would you agree?  Is that kind of what you've been thinking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, hopefully you learn something as an entrepreneur from from project to project.  I sure hope so, because, you know, you tend to make new mistakes.  So if you're making the old mistakes to that's really going to be difficult.  The very first company I started, you may recall, was called Hotlinks.  And it was sort of like delicious.  But several years before delicious.  And I did learn something.  This was back during the dot com boom.  I did learn that people do not want to do work and that regular people don't organize their stuff.  Regular people just have every photo they've ever been sent on their desktop and all their emails in one hotmail folder.  And they don't really organize things.  So because we had this vision that people are going to take their bookmarks and favorites from Netscape and Internet Explorer and turn them into these wonderful Yahoo style directories that they would share with people.  And we just found that most people didn't really have their stuff organized.  And so the idea of people sharing links with each other was a fantastic idea.  But doing it as bookmarking was a little bit too nerdy.  So I think since then I tried to realize that I had to make things simpler.  And then with Friendster, it was pretty simple.  And to this day, you know, saying is this person your friend?  Yes, no. On Facebook is not perfect because it's a little clumsy and it lacks a little nuance.  But every person who copied Friendster and tried to make it more complicated and tried to have you rate your friends and categories and all the things that didn't work.  So this simple approach was the one that worked.  So and I've extended that now into Nuzle.  Like I said, I think most previous personalization aggregation projects that have come out of Silicon Valley have been really complicated.  And we've tried to create something that is that is really simple.  And that's just I think completely informs everything we've done with Nuzle.  And it's a very, very different product.  And it's a very different, I think, vision.  We're trying to save people time and give you just the stuff you need to know about.  We're not trying to say, you know, spend tons of time customizing it and then spend five hours a day in Nuzle.  We're trying to say, like, use this to just get the stuff you really need to know, just solve your overload.  So simplicity has been a big part of it.  But, of course, creating a simple product is actually not simple.  It's actually really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking with Jonathan Abrams.  It's this week in Google, not normally an interview show, but it's hard not to talk to Jonathan like an interview because you want to know more, especially with a product that I use day in, day out and apparently know nothing about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in a way that's you've been using it fine.  I actually checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's great is and I think Twitter could learn from this is that the out of the box experience is fabulous.  And you don't you know, and then I guess if you're motivated, you could press the discover button and, you know, start to dig a little bit deeper.  If anything, you made it too good out of the box.  There's no incentive to go any farther.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the fact that you're not using the discover features yet, which only launched a couple of months ago, is not really a problem.  So, I mean, Leo, you're using Nuzle around four to five days a week, week after week after week after week.  That's pretty good.  I don't think we'd say that we're disappointed in that level of usage.  I don't use it on my days off.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every other day.  I'm only that's one of my newsbeat checks.  I'm sorry.  Jeff, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you an unfair question.  What would you do if you own Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Think about it.  I'm going to give you a minute to think about it because that is a great question.  And I like it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is time for a commercial.  We're going to pay.  That's a tease.  Jonathan Abrams is here.  Jeff Jarvis in his brand new studio.  We're still working out some of the bugs, but I think it looks awfully good.  It's pretty darn impressive.  The lighting is perfect.  You obviously have professional gaffers there at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we have professionals in television like crazy.  They run CUNY TV and they run the studio and they're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're got Neumann Mike and you're really doing, you're actually living quite at large there.  It looks fabulous.  Thank you to all of the people there at CUNY for setting that up.  Thanks to Sarah, the dean of the...  Is it TOW or TOE or how do you pronounce that school?  TOW night.  TOW night.  The TOW night school of journalism.  TOW night.  TOW night school of journalism, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's the TOW night center at the CUNY graduate school of journalism.  I knew I'd get it wrong.  No, let's get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The TOW night center at the CUNY school of journalism in New York City in Times Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the center of the universe.  Unlike you wimps out there where you live in Lotus Land, we get real things done here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm surprised you're even in.  I thought that the whole town was shut down.  No, we're tough.  Does a path work when the snow is heavy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they shut down part of it, but it's fine now.  Okay.  I was delayed getting back from Zurich by a day.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were worried about that last week.  You thought you might be stuck at Zurich.  Oh, you had to have fondue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sunday, nothing's open.  Nothing is open.  Nothing is open.  But I had some good meals.  It looks like you did.  I saw some pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Jeff Jarvis has all started because we were talking about AMP as we have many times on this show.  Jonathan heard the show.  We said, Leo, you got some things wrong.  We went back and forth a little bit.  And then Jeff said, well, we got to get Jonathan on the show to talk about it.  Jonathan's interest is because Nuzzle and as we mentioned when we were talking about AMP is one of the first places you could see Google's accelerated.  What does the M stand for?  M pages.  Accelerated mobile pages in the real world.  And in fact, AMP is about to launch for real in February.  But somehow Jonathan has an inside track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says it's an open right, Jonathan.  It's just an open standard.  So you just started using it, right?  You found content that fits and you implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, once Facebook announced instant articles, we thought having news stories load really quickly on mobile phones instead of being awful and slow sounds great.  Yeah.  But it shouldn't just be fast in Facebook.  It should be fast in Nuzzle, LinkedIn, Twitter, Gmail, Pocket.  It should be, you know, that sounds great, but that should work and everything.  So the idea that publishers should publish into proprietary Nuzzle CMS, not really realistic since we're not a giant company yet like Apple or Facebook.  But even if we were, Nuzzle supports the long tail.  We have users all over the world.  So even though we haven't translated our app outside of English, we have people who use it in all these countries.  They're seeing content from other countries.  I mean, we were we're not, you know, Nuzzle would not work if it only worked with like the top 10 newspapers and like that.  So there so Nuzzle supports a long tail of content, whatever the people that you follow are sharing.  That's what is being shown to you.  So it really has to be an open web approach.  So we came up with an idea of something analysis to Facebook incident articles, but based on HTML and HTTP, where there'd be a meta tag and would point to an alternate version that you just load the HTTP and any compliant client could just discover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you were kind of you were ready for this.  We were.  We were championing the bid for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yes, we we had an idea that because of, you know, the way Nuzzle really is in some ways open itself, it had to be something very similar to AMP.  Then we heard from some people about AMP and we we said, well, that's pretty much exactly what we had been imagining ourselves.  Nuzzle, of course, not nearly has the resources of Google.  So the fact that Google was already working with all these publishers on something that was pretty much what we had thought we needed was a great happy coincidence.  So then we got involved in the Nuzzle.  I mean, the AMP project prior to the I guess the unveiling of it.  And we said, you know, we're sort of a pretty nimble, you know, technical startup team.  We can just have our Android and iPhone app supporting this the minute that the project is unveiled.  And we did that because some of the newspapers that were early partners on the publishing side were already publishing AMP pages.  We we started coding it up and it worked.  So as of the day, I forget when that was.  It was a few months ago.  Was it September?  I can't remember exactly when it was.  But as of October, I think.  Yeah. Yeah. So the AMP project was unveiled by Google and there were five or six tech partners.  And it was like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, WordPress, huge multi-billion dollar companies and Nuzzle.  And we were the only ones, you know, the only team that will start up included that early.  But we were also the I think the only ones that actually as of that moment were displaying AMP content live in our app.  So we're we've already had it actually working since the day the project was unveiled and we've been super excited to be part of it.  And we're still in further talks with Google about how to use more of Google's technologies that are related to AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we like what Jonathan? Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the next stage is using Google's cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Right. Which they've offered.  And basically they become your CDN for free if you use AMP content. Right.  Sort of. Yeah. Sort of.  I mean, I told the story on the show here when I came back from the Google news guys in Helsinki where where is an article has just been announced.  And I was among those who said loudly Google, you should do an open source version of this.  And I wrote about it. Jonathan contacted me immediately and said, we're working on something like that.  Let's get people together.  And I didn't think Google was going to do it at first.  And by God, they turned around and they did it and they did it.  And I think nine months, which which even though Google's tons of resources for a big, huge company that was fast.  And then Jonathan was that as he said that day, it's how I can demonstrate AMP to people around the world is to show them a nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So we were thrilled to be to be part of it.  And, you know, it's only I think going to get even better as some of the additional technologies come online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where did you work at all with Google on what AMP ended up being?  Did you did they consult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think most of the consultation so far was with publishers because the publishers were the ones that, yes, you know, really had to make a lot of changes on their end to how they're doing things and then figure out ways to make sure that all of their needs, their needs for tracking and analytics and revenue and all those kind of things were being were being supported.  So I think that's logically been the big focus of it in terms of the client side.  That's lagging behind.  Like, you know, Google themselves is, I think, going to start integrating this in I think it's February.  And I think Pinterest and Twitter, LinkedIn, you know, still are.  It's coming up.  So we were we were, you know, pretty quick on that side.  But for the most part, there wasn't really a lot of changes that we needed, to be honest.  Right. Google has now given us the details of the caching API and asked for our feedback about that.  And that's something we're looking at right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The publishers are worried about some of them worried about paywalls and how to handle that.  The day after the last show last Thursday, there was a meeting of the founding publishers and Google,  the Digital News Initiative, where this really kind of launched a year ago at Davos.  And so this is a progress report of where we are.  And it's really moved well.  And everybody's pretty excited about where this is.  So I'll bring up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, let me demonstrate it.  So just so we can see the value of it.  So this is Nuzle on Android, which, by the way, is a thing you did on iOS first.  You did it on Android.  It's it's just great.  I usually do it on the Web because I'm sitting down at breakfast going through news stories before our day begins.  But it's if I ever have to read news on my mobile, it's a really great way to do it.  Now, I won't see it on the Web, right?  I won't see app on the Web.  I'll only see it on my mobile.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For and certainly Nuzle, we're only showing it in our Android and iPhone apps.  It only makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't only make sense, but it makes most sense in a mobile environment.  Yeah.  But but typically on a desktop, you're connected to a fast Internet connection.  You're not going to see the difference.  In fact, here you won't.  Google is going to show AMP content only on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, it's not necessarily within an app.  I think if you go to Google search within a browser on mobile, I think they're going to show it.  That's right.  So what Nuzle does with AMP content in mobile browsers, that's an open issue.  So which publish our mobile users are probably using our Android or iPhone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which publisher should I open?  How many of these are amped?  The Times is amped, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah, they should be.  It should flash a lightning bolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see if it flashes a lightning bolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't try the Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try Washington Post, the Guardian or the Post.  Let's see if I can find one of those in my my feed here.  Let's do another Times article.  Yeah, you saw that area.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so sign in paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's an interesting thing.  AMP actually worked hard to make sure paywalls were honored even through a cash, I guess.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're currently not using the Google cash yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  OK. So you're supporting the paywall then some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, AMP making the mobile content load quick and paywalls are really orthogonal issues.  I see. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The paywall is just going to work.  I'll log into my Times account in a second.  I just I don't know why it's not logged in here.  I'm trying to find something that is amped.  Because they log you out some time regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They seem to, don't they?  Peeves me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I seem to log.  Well, you know, I can log in pretty quick.  Let me let me try it again.  You know what?  They didn't require a log in for the public editors post.  So I'm thinking they want the public to see that.  And that was also not amped.  I think blogs.  There's no log in for blogs.  That's what it is.  OK. And they didn't amp blogs, apparently.  Yeah.  So you get a lightning bolt that loads faster.  I'm not one of those people who knows is a big difference because I'm usually on a fast connection.  And the sites I'm going to are not the junked up sites that have lots of crappy ads.  But those are probably not amped anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, people have definitely noticed a difference.  I mean, people we've had people tweet like, oh, my God, it's so much faster.  And the funny thing is we're not yet doing the caching or prefetch, which would be probably enabled by using the caching.  So even with just avoiding loading hundreds of megabytes of multiple redundant JavaScript libraries, just that part alone, people absolutely have noticed the speed difference and tweeted about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of weird because the button doesn't work for log in.  I don't know why, but maybe that's a side effect of trying to run this through an app system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's my issue.  It looks like New York Times has changed their paywall a little bit just just very recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So it's not been tested.  So here's kind of my issue.  The thing that concerns me is when I hear that image tags are different, Google has specified a new way of doing image tags.  JavaScript is only allowed if Google allows it and certain snippets are allowed and not and many, many, many more not.  Well, everything else is not.  It is.  I understand the desire to do this and the value of it for users.  But I worry that Google has invented a new kind of HTML without in the involvement of standards bodies just by talking to publishers that is in effect.  And this is what I said in the tweet, forking the Web.  So I wanted to give you a chance, a, to tell me what I got wrong, because that was your initial tweet.  And B, is that not the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's the case because it's not really a fork of the web.  And the reality is AMP is the web.  It is a alternate HTML file, still HTML, still loaded the HTTP.  And and essentially it's just trying to standardize things more.  So instead of all these different publishers having their own set of redundant bloated JavaScript libraries, Google's saying here is a single runtime that we're going to try to make solve all these needs and then address the bloat problem that's been causing so much problems for people on their mobile devices.  And it is an open project.  I mean, there's a GitHub repo.  And whether you're on the client side or the publisher side, you can go and contribute and talk to them about that.  Whether someday it becomes part of a standard thing, I don't know.  I doubt Google would be opposed to that.  But even now, you know, it really is more open than any of the alternatives.  And the alternatives are some of these closed platforms from some of these other big companies.  And, you know, the reality is if Nuzle wanted to say, OK, publishers already publishing their content for Apple News or Facebook and articles.  Great. Let's just show that in Nuzle.  We can't do that.  So that that that to me is really not open.  And, you know, whereas AMP is something that we were able to be part of.  And if publishers publish their stuff in AMP, if somebody in Croatia publishes something in AMP and then and then some startup in New York builds some new app that supports AMP, you know, to companies that have never even heard of, it's just going to work.  So that, you know, that kind of any fork as soon as somebody supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But look what's prohibited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me try this on you.  I think the difference is that a fork would mean that you that you'd be cut out.  You couldn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.  That's not what a fork means.  A fork means that you take some.  So it would fork HTML that you have a standard.  And then you decided Google's decided that instead of image will use AMP.  It's not a subset.  It's a replacement.  It's not really.  So HTML, HTML 4.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that was kind of like a fork of HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was W3C proposed.  That was through a standards body.  But HTML has evolved.  I don't I don't have a problem with it evolving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the reality is Microsoft and Netscape and all those companies had did fork HTML and added proprietary things that eventually back into standards.  In this case, Google's not even doing that.  In this case, AMP is really simply just an HTML page.  It is an it is a you know, here's a JavaScript library that you can run in a standard browser in a standard HTML page instead of a proprietary JavaScript library from this publisher or one of the other.  Publisher or one from all these different analytics and ad companies.  It's a it's a it's a standard one.  But it's still it's still it's still JavaScript running on an HTML page.  It's not really a new kind of HTML.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can't use IMG.  You have to use AMP dash IMG.  You can't use object param applet embed form prohibited prohibited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use whatever you want to use.  But it won't be an AMP page.  It's not going to be as fast.  No, it won't be an AMP page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do whatever you want, but it's not an AMP page.  But being an AMP page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's where it becomes a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And remember, this is the idea is that the AMP page is a alternative version of something that exists in regular alternative version that is from Google and is promoted in the Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not to me the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AMP per se.  They don't favor AMP per se.  They do favor speed and AMP is fast, but they don't favor AMP per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if somebody came out with their own AMP-like faster way of doing things, that would also get the benefit to Google's search rankings.  But it really isn't technically it's not a fork.  Technically, it really just is an HTML page with a but you know, it's like using jQuery instead of rewriting your own jQuery like library.  This time it's a you know, it's something that's that's been provided but is open because there is a GitHub repo and people can can go in there and see it all and contribute.  But I think it's also important to think about this in the context of the different realistic options.  So, you know, option one is these proprietary platforms, which really are going back to like the CompuServe and AOL days.  These are these truly closed platforms.  Option two is that everybody just starts using ad blockers or using the reader mode in Safari or Firefox and stripping all the branding and business model stuff out of the pages because they're just so frustrated by all the bloat and the problems.  And I don't think those are those are really great options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  What's your Leo, Leo, what's your worst fear of what I'm does this is a this is a land grab by Google, plain and simple, because Google approved advertising is allowed Google approved JavaScript is allowed.  Google favors AMP results for whatever reasons in its browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is a land grab.  What about Apple News or Facebook and Stenarticle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't disagree that those are land grab, but those live in the Apple environment and Facebook environment.  I'm not see.  I think it's a mistake to say, well, there's a worst thing out there.  Yes, there's a worst thing out there.  There are lots of worse things, including CompuServe.  But that doesn't mean this is different because it's from Google and it's quote open as many Google quote open source projects like Android are supposedly somewhat open.  This is Google and Google driven.  And I understand Google was terrified about ad blockers because they're basically an ad project.  You know, that's their business.  And and so their response is, well, instead of fixing ad tech, we're just going to we're just going to have our own little thing and block all the bad ad tech.  Although I notice outbrain and tabool are right right in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they are trying to fix ad tech by standardizing things.  I think that's exactly what they're trying to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and, you know, I think the best way to fix ad tech is to block it.  Now, I think for you, Jonathan, I think this is a great boon to Nuzle because that means Nuzle is a is, you know, to the degree that the articles I read Nuzle or AMP much better experience, much better experience.  Here's the thing.  You feel like you don't need Nuzle.  It's a better experience for the publishers.  It's a better experience for the end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a better experience for any other apps that implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's certainly, I think, a better experience for everybody than people simply using an ad blocker or reader mode to strip out everything.  That's not good for anybody, really.  What doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.  Doesn't really solve that.  People are still use ad blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate to tell you, because most of this stuff they visit is going to be if you're getting a page that has ads, but it's not super slow and it's not ridiculous ads and it's not annoying with pop ups and interstitial.  I mean, it's a reasonable amount of ads.  Then you're probably not going to need to use an ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but this is always going to be a subset of the web that I'm surfing, right?  Or is it going to be the future?  Is this the future of the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you're going to see the entire web.  That's the difference.  You will see the entire web.  It's just some pages will be faster than other pages, which is true today.  And those horrible pages that are full of ads, I will still see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I will still use an ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if Facebook, I guess not Facebook, but if Nuzle, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Gmail, Pocket, all end up supporting AMP, then I think publishers who end up not publishing an AMP version of their page would be pretty silly.  So if this works, it may be that the bulk of what's out there does end up being published as AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Leo's point about land grab though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm not really sure if Nuzle and Pinterest and WordPress and LinkedIn and Twitter and all of us all get to participate in it equally.  I'm kind of not sure who's grabbing the land.  I mean, if it's when the when the content is being published into proprietary Apple or Facebook system, it's pretty clear who's who's benefiting and who's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about if I just want to use HTML, the HTML as proposed by the W3C?  You can use it.  Yeah, but am I not going to be at a disadvantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think you're already at a disadvantage.  If you have a really slow crappy experience, which a lot of people do, unfortunately, then people are getting frustrated.  What if I have a nice fast page?  And that's why they're resorting to ad blockers.  And the ad blockers are obviously really bad for publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  OK, I mean, I mean, that's we disagree on this, but I think we both I've made my point.  The good news is this is doomed.  But other than that, I think it's it's going to be great because I don't I don't see a lot.  I mean, the big publishers obviously have jumped right on the bandwagon.  Do you think everybody's going to just say, hey, I got to make two pages now, one amp, one non-amp.  This is this is great.  I can't wait to do that.  Is that what is that the future we envision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I was just running low on my battery and asking, so would you bring me a charger?  Bring him a charger while you get a charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, we'll take a break.  No, that's all right.  We'll talk about it later.  I'll take a break.  Get a charger.  We are.  Yes.  So block this, if you will.  I don't know why it gets me upset, but I'm getting more and more upset.  I wasn't as upset initially.  Now I'm thinking it's a terrible idea because I really see Google.  Doogle does stuff and they say, well, from an engineering point of view, this makes perfect sense.  This is, of course, what could be wrong with speeding up the net.  But that's why their standards bodies.  I think it's a good thing.  Now, admittedly, a lot of these standards bodies are run basically by a bunch of big companies.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Our show today brought to you by Snacks.  That's what I need.  I'm just, you know, I need a low, I'm low blood sugar, but I'm not going to eat one of them sugar filled candy bars.  No, maybe I'll have something delicious.  Oh, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on the last show I ungraciously complained about the bait and switch of getting my Fez in a Nature Box box.  So what should arrive from Twitter?  Uh huh.  We don't want you to be unhappy.  We don't do bait and switch.  I was very, oh no, I was very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Naturebox.com slash tweet.  Get 50% off your first box right now.  I love this.  Thanks to Nuzzle.  I love these, some of the articles that are showing up like the New York Times article.  And actually I was curious what you thought about it.  Trying to interview Google's co-founder, it's emasculating, writes Conor Doherty.  You've interviewed Larry more than a few times, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've never interviewed him.  You haven't really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you never got emasculated by the process, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you'll actually know this is trying to.  He doesn't.  And it's journalists complaining about how they can't do their job is not a sympathetic genre to me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like this is from the insider though, so we shouldn't blame it because this is that thing you pay extra for to get kind of insight into how the sausage is made.  So this was not like in the paper.  I hope.  Oh, I see.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find the distinction kind of funny.  I mean, the fact that the New York Times still has this distinction between the blog and the insider and the regular paper, it's 2016.  I mean, those distinctions, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying they're forking the New York Times?  I think they're trying stuff is what they are.  You know, it's tough to have a paywall, isn't it?  And so they're trying to figure out what will people pay for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, they're splitting it up on the basis of their content and their needs rather than our needs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think, you know, here's the world.  I talked to a lot of publishers who are interested in Nuzle and potentially working with us.  And, you know, it's kind of funny when somebody's title is the VP of digital at a newspaper.  I just kind of think that's funny in 2016 and New York Times.  You know, there's a lot of smart people there.  They're doing a lot of cool stuff.  But the concept of still what's going to be in paper versus not, I just think is just kind of funny to still think about that so much in 2016.  He has a there is what there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't even the headline bothers me.  I mean, if you were a woman trying to interview Google's co-founder, would you also be emasculated?  What is that? I don't even know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a joke about his his wasn't it?  Wasn't it Larry's? Was it Larry or Sergey who talked about the phone being a master?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's where that's coming from.  That sounds more like a very inside.  If that's OK. So now see, I'm even inside and I didn't.  You're right. That's obviously what that is.  This is the one I the paragraph I like.  Whenever someone asks me what I do at the Times and I tell them I cover Google, the result is often a confused stare.  That's it.  That's a beat.  This is a show. This is a show.  We do a show on Google.  What? That's it.  All right. No more. No, no more on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to ask, why is there not a This Week in Twitter show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There could be.  In fact, thank you for reminding me because Jeff posed an interesting question and we've given you some time and a battery to think about it.  What would you do?  What would Twitter do?  What would you do with Twitter right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it you know, we do a lot of stuff with Twitter already with Nuzle.  And, you know, I think you kind of built on Twitter initially, right?  Yeah. And I think we're we're as we're going forward, we've been adding a lot more stuff and maybe we added in partnership.  We were one of Slack's first integration partners and we're going to be launching more of those in 2016.  But even though I invented a lot of the features of Facebook, Twitter is kind of where I go first and sort of where I live online these days personally.  You know, I love Twitter and, you know, I am one of those people who, you know, engages in a lot of sort of, you know, conversations with our with Nuzle's users on Twitter, with investors, with with users, with journalists.  And I love Twitter.  Jeff, I think asked what would I what would I do if I owned Twitter?  But did you really mean what would I do if I was like in charge?  Is that what you were asking?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because poor Twitter is confused.  It lost some more.  It lost another handful of executives this week, one of going to become chief of product at Instagram.  Lost Katie Stanton, who was in charge of media and other things.  There's been a constant round robin.  People are constantly wondering what it is.  The stock value is down.  I use Twitter to the world doesn't.  There was a discussion before about Twitter being too hard.  So you've built a beautiful, elegant, simple product as you talked about a simple and Twitter in a sense should be the simplest thing in the world.  But it's not.  What would you do to with the company?  That's kind of what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  300 million people are using Twitter, which is actually a huge amount.  So when people say, oh, nobody's using Twitter, that's obviously not true at all.  300 million people is huge.  What's going on is they're being compared to Facebook, which has even more.  So the question is not, you know, oh, you know, it's not a lot of people are using Twitter.  A lot of people are using Twitter.  But now people are like, OK, how could it be instead of 300 million?  How could it be a billion?  And I do have ideas for that.  I mean, one of the things that we're working on at Nuzle, like I said, is figuring out ways that people who are not Twitter power users can benefit of our social curation approach.  Because right now, if somebody loves Nuzle and tells all their friends about it, because not everybody uses Twitter, a lot of those friends, you know, for her or old product, the one that you and Leo still use, they might not have been able to get the benefit from it.  And one of the things that we've been really excited about is using Nuzle to build newsletters because everybody has email and people being able to subscribe to the Lila Port or Jeff Jarvis newsletter and get really interesting content with the newsletters.  Without having to log in, set up, config, download, install anything, just an email address, we think that's really powerful.  And I actually think that, you know, that could be really cool for Twitter as well.  I mean, there's all these celebrities on Twitter.  And why isn't, you know, there Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Katy Perry or Justin Bieber or Oprah newsletter?  If you don't use Twitter and you go to Oprah or Donald Trump's Twitter page, I think it's a bit confusing right now exactly what's going on and how you can engage with that in a way that's a little easier than actually logging in and creating a Twitter account.  So if you could subscribe and say, okay, give me the Donald Trump newsletter, I think that'd be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that. Or the Andreessen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, imagine this. Imagine if...  In effect, you just described Nuzzle.  Sure. But imagine if the top million most famous people on Twitter each had a newsletter with a thousand subscribers. You'd be sending a billion emails a day.  Yeah. That's an interesting thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that's a crazy thing to imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I mean, how many people would sign up for the Donald Trump or the Hillary Clinton one alone?  So I have a lot of ideas for Twitter, of course. I love Twitter.  And right now, Nuzzle has been doing all sorts of cool things with Twitter as well as with other services.  I mean, if I had full access to all of Twitter's data unrestricted, I mean, we could probably do even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love to see that. I'd love to see Twitter have a better relationship with developers and make the firehose available.  How do you... Do you use the Twitter API? How do you interact with Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do use the Twitter API. We've gotten great support from Twitter. They've even at times done some fixes to the API to help Nuzzle, which we really appreciate.  That being said, of course, there's still even more things that I'd like that are not necessarily the only priority that they have.  So Twitter has been great and really supportive of Nuzzle, but I still don't have complete unlimited access to all the data and technology that they have.  So we could probably do even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Given Twitter's rocky relationship with third-party developers, didn't it concern you a little bit building a business on top of Twitter's feeds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The funny thing is I think that the sort of miscommunications that happened a few years ago were more bark than bite.  And in reality, the number of companies that Twitter cut off was probably not as much as the impression, the confusion that stemmed from some of the blog posts that were written a few years back.  And the funny thing is we've had harder problems working with some other companies than we've had with Twitter.  And in our case, Twitter has been supportive and has helped us in a number of different ways.  So we've had a really good relationship with Twitter, and we fortunately haven't had to be really concerned.  And obviously now Jack has come out and said, hey, we're sorry for some of the miscommunication in the past.  We really want to reengage with developers. And I think that's great.  In fact, they just announced a whole tour, a sort of Hello World! developer relations Twitter tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. That's very encouraging.  But see, I feel like Twitter could look at you and say, gee, I like what Jonathan's come up here with, Nuzle. We should do that.  You're not worried about that. I guess it's really pretty far-fetched for them to do what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Twitter has done some things. I mean, they had Discover and they recently had Moments. Facebook has launched a bunch of stuff.  You know, there's lots of people doing things in the world of news apps, discovery, curation.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. But worrying about that too much is usually sort of beside the point.  We're trying to figure out how can we make sure that Nuzle is doing things that a lot of people could use.  And that's what we're focused on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just, for one, I'm really surprised to hear that Twitter has advertisements in its feed. I was shocked. Shocked.  Because you're one of the important guys who doesn't know.  Apparently, I don't get them. I do remember that day when there were advertisements in my Twitter feed.  And then I saw an article the other day saying, important people don't get ads.  And I went and I thought, you know what? I haven't had an ad in quite a while. I do see promoted trends. That's an ad, right?  Apparently, moving on up is a promoted trend right now.  But I don't... I use only TweetDeck for Twitter. So you don't see ads either, right? I never see ads.  But what would these ads that I'm not seeing look like? Would they be in the stream?  Would there be like, as Instagram does, you know, we pause your stream for a moment to show you some content?  Or I don't know where those ads are. I don't see them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you'd see promoted tweets right in your stream.  Okay.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We're very bad people to ask about this, apparently.  What do you peons see? Do you see...  I guess I should really stop right there. There's no percentage in this conversation.  I'm a little worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I follow a lot of people. So I kind of...  I can't tell.  I can't really keep up with my raw stream. So I look at my... I do a lot of searches.  I look at my ad mentions. I use Nuzle. So I'm on Twitter many times a day.  But I'm sort of using it in different ways than just looking at my raw stream.  But then again, I'm obviously not a normal user necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I posted my first poll.  I use only my MediaWalks list.  Yeah. I mean, I think we've all learned ways to use Twitter to our advantage.  And that's probably part of the problem with Twitter.  Less to Twitter's advantage.  I do note that Tommy Chong follows me on Twitter.  And in fact, of the famous Cheech and Chong duo, he even tweeted,  We should all aspire to be as cool as Leo one day.  Whoa.  But does he use Nuzle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Probably. Who wouldn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then I, for the first time ever, used a Twitter poll.  The Twitter poll thing.  Even Donald Trump used a Twitter poll.  Yeah. I actually really liked it.  Now that they have more than two choices, I asked what kind of a Tesla I should get.  And the two-third majority out of 6,000 votes said get the Model X.  So I did. I let the Twitterverse choose my new car with some constraints.  Some constraints around it.  Google has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a sponsorship opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I blew it. Could have made some money there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just, you know, you could have been a Ford or whoever would pay you to drive that car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, as a matter of fact, Ford was a sponsor for several years,  and I drove a Mustang during that time.  But you know what I did? It was kind of... It was completely speculative.  When I was approached about advertising for Ford, I said,  Well, I don't know. Let me buy a Ford car, and I'll get back to you.  So I didn't get a free Mustang or anything.  I actually paid full retail for a Mustang, and they said,  Yes, I love this SYNC stuff. Let's do it.  So I then continued to drive a Mustang for several years.  I've moved on because so has Ford.  No, that's not why.  I realized I'm too old to be driving a sports car. This is the real reason.  Little worried about this. Hangouts 7 is coming, is being slowly rolled out.  I don't think I have it yet.  It's slowly being rolled out to Android users, and I guess iOS users as well.  Here's what I worry about.  They're discouraging you from using it for text messaging.  When you launch 7, they've added this notification quick reply, which is nice,  but you already had that in messages on Android devices.  And on the first launch of the new Hangouts 7, you'll see a pop-up that says,  Switch to Messenger for SMSing.  There had been rumors for some time that Hangouts would eliminate text messaging.  And now I'm really worried.  Am I going to have to start using Google's Messages app on my Nexus?  I did switch. I took their word for it.  And there's a nice cat, which I love because I pay for Google Contributors,  so I get lots of cats in my feeds.  I'm impressed by the number of sites now using Google Contributor, by the way.  I'm also seeing a lot of kitty cats.  What do you think, Jeff?  Are we worried about the loss of text message capability in Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because I've been using Messenger.  You have too. You switched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I got Fi, they said switch. Google's really pushing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Leo, I think Jonathan has an out.  Is it time to go, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, good. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to run.  We had a great time. Thank you so much for being here.  I'm really happy you're here, Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to get into specifically why they use a different kind of image tag in AMP,  because we went down to Mountain View and met with...  Oh, tell us.  ...his best, David Bezbriz.  Yes.  And he specifically talked about how the browsers have a contract  for any image tag to absolutely show it,  and there are technical reasons why not using the standard image tag  ended up being technically useful for trying to do the things that they're doing with AMP.  And perhaps in the future, these things maybe will become an open standard,  and maybe slight changes to the browsers will be made to address that.  Maybe it won't be needed forever.  But some of the things that you're concerned about,  there were, at least for now, specific technical reasons  why they were using their own version of the image tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Fair enough. Hey, it's great, Jonathan. It was great having you back.  Thank you for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. My pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good work with Nuzzel, N-U-Z-Z-E-L.com,  available not only on the web but for iOS and Android,  and really one of my favorite... I'm going to say my favorite news app.  I do... I have a beat check. I do TechMeme.  I do Hacker News from Y Combinator, and I do Nuzzel.  And I feel like I'm seeing everything I want to see from those three. It's great.  Great.  Thank you, Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Leo.  See you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm worried about this Hangouts thing, I have to say.  But everybody's saying, oh, just use Messenger. You'll be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hangouts, I always had a problem with Hangouts,  trying to figure out the what's in Hangouts, what's in SMS.  The UI was never smooth enough for me.  So I actually am happy to separate out messaging back to Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Okay. I'm just going to do it.  Weird, maybe.  Can you type slash shruggy in Messenger and get the shruggy guy?  Let me try. No.  That's disappointing, because you can in Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Already you're unhappy. Already you're going back.  It's one second and you're unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, everybody says, but it's material design,  and you can embed all the things that you like in there,  and the animated... I don't think you do animated gifts,  but you can do stickers and all that stuff.  I don't know. I'm worried, because Hangouts is how I get all of my text messages  to all of my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. It is weird. Google put so much effort into Hangouts,  and now they do seem to be deprecating it, as they did Google+.  Not killing it, but who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well. I guess we'll just figure it out.  But if you are still using Hangouts, try slash shruggy.  I'm going to send you a shruggy, Jason. Let's see if I can send you a shruggy.  You know, lately Jason and I have been communicating more on Facebook Messenger,  which is...  It seems to be the quickest way.  Is it the quickest way to reach me? Is that the issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fast. It's good. It's easy. And I can put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus the little bubble, you've got to deal with the message,  because the damn bubble is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It definitely gets your attention.  It gets your attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay. So I'm doing slash shruggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's nice.  I have no way to show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't see my screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait. Yeah, I can't see it on my side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I can't send it to you. I'll send it to you, Emmett.  Yeah.  I sent it to Gary. Let's send one to Jason Clanthus.  Okay, here we go. You don't have to show it. Just show it on my screen.  Okay.  So here we go. Slash shruggie.  That's the very complicated emoticon that is...  Like, I don't even know. I don't even know how people do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the shruggy? Yeah.  Can you show the shruggy?  Yeah, I'm zooming in. I'm trying to get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to show the rest of it. There you go. See?  Well, I'll do it again.  You'll understand, Jason, why you're getting all these shruggies.  If I send it to somebody else...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Okay, but now let's character count.  Backslash shruggy, and then how many characters are even the shrug?  You have to figure out what these characters are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that character? I don't even know what that character is.  That's a Japanese character.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine shruggies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hover over it. It showed like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I had it selected.  It showed the date and time.  Oh, okay. That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shruggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to do another one. Let's just shrug, shrug, shrug, shrug.  Shruggy.  You feel like there's a lot of these hidden in there that just Google isn't telling us.  There's stuff that Google's not telling us about.  They know all the secrets.  So come on, guys. What else?  You can now do donation cards on YouTube if you would like your viewers to support, not you, nonprofits.  That's kind of cool.  Now you and your viewers can make a genuine difference in the world.  And it's popping up. You're missing the whole thing, Jason.  I'm sorry. I'll back up.  Okay.  There it is.  There it is.  What are you, trying to find your shruggy? Is that what you're doing?  I'm not going to send you any more shruggies.  All right. Enough of that.  Oh, you just sent me a shruggy back. I heard it.  Stop shrugging me.  Moving on.  Mark Zuckerberg.  Back to work.  That was a short family leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He really took it. Two months.  That's more than most dads do in the world.  It is.  And you saw the picture of his closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little weird. He's got a lot of gray shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got all gray shirts and blue hoodies.  Wow.  What I want to know is how does he pick? Is there a Thursday shirt and a Friday shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he says, first day back after paternity leave, what should I wear?  You know, I really like these guys like this because they're...  Wasn't it F. Scott Fitzgerald who said, the rich are not like you and me.  They can get ideas that you and I might just float through our head like,  you know, I just wish all my clothes were the same and I wouldn't have to pick them.  And they would float through my head and I would move on.  What I didn't know is Steve Jobs was the same argument.  He says, hey assistant, go out and buy 150 gray shirts and hoodies.  Put them in my closet. Give everything else to goodwill.  And it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No more wire hangers.  No, they're not wire. They're beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're all lined up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So David Agus, the doctor to many stars, including Steve Jobs, said on Howard Stern  that Jobs convinced him to just wear black because Jobs said that if you wear the same thing every day,  people won't pay attention to what you wear. They'll pay attention to what you say.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I took Est, I was told that...  You didn't.  Yeah, I loved Est.  I know. I meant to talk to you about this because you were going on and on about Werner.  When I took Est in 1978, I had a lime green bed.  But I remember that the trainers were told to dress in a very neutral way  so that you wouldn't be looking like, oh, what's he wearing?  You wouldn't be looking at that. You'd be listening to the message.  So this is, of course, this is absolutely true.  Now I'm going to be looking at Mark's... I don't know.  When you have a lot of T-shirts, A, do you hang them up in your closet?  No. That's what the closet is. I thought they'd be folded.  Do you have somebody... Look carefully at these. Somebody has ironed them.  Also notice that...  And I'm guessing it's not Priscilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also notice the exact separation in the hangers, equally separate from each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's possible he did that for the Instagram, as people will.  We don't see the rest of the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And are those the Facebook hoodies with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  They're brandless.  He just wears hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hoodies are not ironed, but those T-shirts are conspicuously creased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I wonder where the jeans are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no one would wear ironed jeans.  Well, I've known people who do.  Somebody said, or they're new, and he just...  Okay, Fred's in the chair and says, maybe they're just new.  Google is now going to... This is... They can only end in tears.  Fact check candidates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not. They're not going to enable you to fact check.  They'll let you...  To give a correction to that headline.  Oh, thank God.  Which is the way it exists now anyway. You can use Google to fact check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called Googling the quote. Yeah.  Okay.  So they're doing that anyway.  Although there is a fact check site that I liked.  And who is it? Is it The Post?  Somebody's doing this on a regular basis.  Yeah, there's a couple of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good. It's useful.  Plus, they're always reliable snopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Do they do fact checks on the debates?  No, they don't, but they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they probably do want Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's going to be fascinating?  So Trump has apparently decided not to...  He doesn't like Megyn Kelly, and he refuses to participate in the debate tomorrow.  Because Megyn Kelly...  Because Fox refuses to take Megyn Kelly, as they should,  has refused to take Megyn Kelly off the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just a New Yorker headline that said that many Americans are perplexed  by suddenly having the need to sympathize with Megyn Kelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But she's so pretty.  But my question is...  He says he's going to do an alternate event.  Is he going to debate himself?  Is he going to put cutouts of Ted Cruz up on the stage and say,  Ted, you don't have much energy.  What is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jack Schaeffer, the media critic, just said on Twitter  that Trump has said so many contradicting things through the years,  he could debate himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that's an interesting thought.  I'd like to debate myself from 1989 and 1992.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I great? Yes, I'm great.  Well, then we agree. I'm great. I'm Trump. I'm the best.  There's nobody like me. I'm Trump. I'm great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what we didn't get from you is a Davos report.  Kevin Spacey had some stuff to say at Davos.  Didn't see him.  He did an interview with TechCrunch.  I guess Sarah Lane and the TechCrunch team was at Davos.  He predicted that tech firms will follow Netflix into media.  Now, Kevin knows a little bit about this because, of course,  he elected to sell House of Cards not to HBO  or one of the other big cable companies or networks,  but to Netflix, and it was their biggest hit.  Made them a lot of money, made him a lot of money,  made everybody very happy.  Kevin is very technically literate.  He is absolutely a gadget hound and loves technology.  So I guess he says in the next few years,  Silicon Valley is going to be much more involved in content.  I would not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think if you see at whatchamacallit,  Film Festival in the snow.  Sundance.  Sundance.  Thank you, Sundance.  A big story about how both Netflix and Amazon  buying up all the films and the distributors were not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're Cinderella at these events.  They go, yes, yes, they're writing checks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it occurred to me, too, that if you look at Apple's results,  which we haven't talked about because they've been over-analyzed,  but Apple's not really in the cloud, they're not really in social,  and the other part that surprises me when you think about it  is that why isn't Apple like Amazon or like Netflix making entertainment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what he says.  I wouldn't be surprised if a big tech company would buy a studio.  Apple has the money.  Apple has the money to buy everything.  The richest, I mean, amazing, the success of...  It's so funny to watch the contrarians say,  oh, yeah, well, sure, Apple had the most profitable quarter  in American history of any company ever in American history.  $18 billion in profit in three months.  But it's the end of the line.  People are saying, sell Apple stock because it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon Studios has started producing its own content.  Yeah, I guess that counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of good content coming out of Amazon,  but I think he's thinking...  iPhone growth, 1% in revenue, 0% in units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iPad down 25% in units.  Mac down 4% in units.  You know what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At some point, you sell a phone to every person on the planet,  and there's nowhere else to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't buy that.  Hi, Leo, how many phones have you bought this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  I'm not the poster boy for that.  I have five numbers inactive at all times.  Somebody asked, my wife asked me, how many phones do you have?  And I actually had to count them.  I have a BlackBerry Priv.  I have a Note 5.  I have a Nexus 6P.  I have, that's my Google Fi.  I have an iPhone.  I'm missing one.  But the reason I rotate the newest stuff through,  because I have five numbers.  Google Fi, two numbers with AT&T.  Do you know all your numbers?  Yeah.  You know what?  That's why I love Hangouts.  That's why I love Google Voice.  Got it.  And that's why I have five,  because that's the most numbers you can have.  Actually, I could have one more,  because Google Fi doesn't count against your total.  So I could have one more.  By the way, good time.  If you want to buy a Nexus phone, Google's clearing them out.  They're blowing it out to the bare walls.  The Nexus 5X, now $299.  And I understand the 6P, for the first time,  is going to go on sale as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't, I don't.  A Valentine's Day promotion.  Oh, hi, honey.  I love you so much.  I bought you a Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought you a ugly phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not seeing that leads to romance.  A great night of love.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honey, you bought me a phone?  Some people would be happy.  You know what?  You want Whoopi?  Buy her an iPhone.  Be honest with you.  Get her a gold iPhone.  No Nexus phone ever got anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly not a BlackBerry, God forbid.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Priv is pretty nice.  I like the Priv.  Sexy it's not.  But sexy it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Davos, I didn't give you a report,  but I did write a piece on Medium today  in which I argued that this is the post-Snowden Davos.  That when I thought back over the week there,  the ways in which he came up constantly was just amazing.  In discussions of cybersecurity and encryption  and security and growth and privacy.  And it's as if he was there already as a politician.  So I don't know that kind of thing.  So was it worth going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because the mockers are there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I see my media people  and I went to the Google Digital News Initiative Media  and I saw Facebook had its big pavilion  and I saw Sheryl Sandberg and other executives there.  So yeah, sure.  You get invited, you go.  Yeah.  Oh, you have to get invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't just show up and say I'm here.  Oh no.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have, I have next year's secret meeting  and I have next year's secret handshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many Davos's in a row have you been to?  Ten.  Ten.  It's the World Economic Forum.  We call it Davos because that's where it's held,  but it's the World Economic Forum.  And who runs it and why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Klaus Schwab, who's a German professor in Switzerland,  and he runs it to bring together the world's leaders  and to try to improve the world.  And they mean that.  They really do mean that.  They convene people.  I sat in one session about the fractured internet  in which the U.S. Secretary of Commerce  and the U.K. Vice President involved over digital stuff.  They're the ones who are really negotiating  the Safe Harbor Agreement, and they're Steve Adler,  the editor of Reuters, pushed them hard  because there's only a week left on this,  and if it expires, we're all messed up.  And Davos can do that.  They can bring together these important people,  these bachers, and kind of bang their heads together  and make them do things.  And sometimes it happens.  So, yeah, it's worth it.  You know, I think you can make fun of the attendants  who are there.  You can make fun of the rich people who are there.  But Davos, the World Economic Forum itself,  I honestly do believe does all in all good work.  I ran a session with, they have a group of young people  called the Global Shapers, slightly odd name, but fine.  And I ran a session on future life in cities,  and there were people I was doing Skype,  it was a lot of like Twig, from India and Pakistan  and Russia and somewhere else,  and the young people who are doing amazing things  in their cities and talking.  That's what the forum does.  So I'll defend the forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think you have to.  I think it sounds awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you see, oh no, a lot of people will attack it  as the 1% and all that, but when you see  Jamie Dimon having just gotten a huge raise  over the other side of the Google party,  you do kind of sneer a little bit.  I admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, people say that about the Bohemian Grove, too,  that it's just a bunch of rich people running the world.  Do you go to Bohemian Grove?  I've been.  Once. I've been once.  Peed on a tree with George Shultz, you know, that kind of thing.  Oh, wow.  Now, a friend of mine many years ago,  I know a few members, the Bohemian Club is interesting.  They have this grove up in Northern California,  and people are always protesting out front  during their annual summer retreat  because that's exactly the point.  They say, you know, this is the smoke-filled room only.  It's among the redwoods where the rich and the powerful  are planning our destiny without our input.  And it is, you know, rich people, but it's also artists  because it was originally conceived by artists, by Bohemians,  to be a get-together, and they now, to this day,  because they do plays in which men dress as women  feature prominently, so that gives you some idea  of how dumb it is, and they have to have talented artists  in the group, so they, you know, scholarship in performers  and musicians and create lots of creatives.  And then the paid members pay, I don't know,  some huge amount of money.  But a friend of mine, Will Hurst, you would think,  if you're William Randolph Hurst III, you would just get in, right?  You'd send him a check, and, can I be in?  He waited for like 30 years to get in.  Somebody had to die before he could get in.  Yeah, I was surprised.  I remember Will saying, hey, I just got into the Bohemian club.  I said, wait a minute.  You weren't in before?  Weren't you grandfathered in, so to speak?  No.  So it's hard to get in.  It's very expensive.  But I know a guy, he said, you know, this is back in the beginning.  You're an internet guru.  We don't know about this internet,  which you come and speak at the Grove, so I did.  But I don't think Davos is anything like that.  In fact, it's more like Ted, isn't it, sounds like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?  No.  Ted is...  Well, I won't get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Ted is elitist.  You know, we were talking about how San Francisco is becoming the center of the tech world.  That's Jason's quote.  But in fact, he's wrong.  Robert Scoble says, it's not Silicon Valley.  It's Champaign, Illinois, and Blacksburg, Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Scoble would know because, as he says in the lead...  Yeah, I'm known as one of Silicon Valley's top tech influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the winner is Champaign, Illinois and Blacksburg, Virginia.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's where the Netscape browser came from, Champaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the NCSA, absolutely,  the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Chicago, Urbana,  or maybe it's Champaign, is certainly a hive of tech innovation.  But so is MIT.  So, I mean, there are lots of places.  Over five million Cardboard viewers were shipped.  I'm guessing about 20% of that with the Sunday Times.  I think it was a million. Yeah, I think you're about right.  A thousand plus VR apps.  I'm not stealing any numbers from you.  This is a blog post from Clay Baver, who's the new VR guy at Google.  They don't make money on Cardboard, I don't think,  but it certainly promotes the widespread use of immersive video, as you would say, not virtual reality.  Verizon spent $70 million, some of that from you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Verizon and I are now divorced.  Yay. Who'd you go with? Verizon, Neville and I are now divorced.  Who'd you go with? I've got AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's fair. They're all bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Verizon spent $70 million to triple the LTE capacity in San Francisco, ahead of the Super Bowl.  Now I want a Verizon phone.  Be glad you're not in the city, Jeff. I hear it's insane.  Insane.  They built 16 new area cell sites. They installed 75 small cells.  They're putting in... It's funny because they already were a big part of Levi Stadium,  the Santa Clara Stadium for the 49ers, where the game is going to be held.  But they put in even more antennas to reach the lower stadium seats and increase peak download speeds.  And they added 37 XLTE connections to existing sites.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  During the Super Bowl last year, I didn't know this, Verizon customers used 4.1 terabytes of data.  They can hail double the capacity. That's actually not that much.  I think we have something like that every day in our downloads.  Wow.  Yeah, we do a petabyte a month.  Wow. And do you pay for this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They haven't asked for a check yet.  They're waiting for the bill.  They're wonderful, aren't they?  Thank you, Cashfly. We love Cashfly. Cashfly.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I tell people. Cashfly is a person that works in an important way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're fantastic. They really do.  Well, it's a trade because they get an ad in every single show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every show. And I tell people Cashfly is the place because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think I've been told that it does work, that that's why they're willing to give us a petabyte a month.  That's really impressive. It's incredibly impressive.  And I've learned the importance of paying bills because, you know, our website went down, Jeff, because I missed a $44 charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. For the domain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the obvious one. And the Twit domain, I register 10 years at a time. I'm not dumb.  But there was this. So we have a very complicated setup. We have like 18 different. It's a complicated.  There's a Drupal back end. There's a Node.js front end. It's on Heroku.  There's caching done by a variety of other sites, including Redis Labs.  And we don't. Redis is very affordable. Redis Labs.  Redis Labs, our bill at Redis Labs is something you give even though with all the traffic to the website is only like $44 a month or $47 a month.  It's very affordable. And it was we had put it on Jeff Needles when we set up the site, put it on a company credit card.  And I, you know, I just I forgot about it.  And of course, the credit card expired in September and Redis Labs kept sending email saying, hey, can you update your credit cards?  And it just went in the email hole. And a couple of days ago, no, he didn't send it to Jeff Needles.  I got it. I don't know where it went. I think I think a lot of people got it.  But there's a lot of traffic, you know, about the website, a lot of auto generated emails.  And I guess we all missed it. So they just said, well, OK, guess you don't want this anymore.  And they turned it off and I woke up yesterday morning to a dead site.  Anyway, they responded quickly. Thank you, Redis Labs.  And I said, really, I'm good for it.  Thank you to Google for saving Banksy's last. Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, that's cool. Miserables. Or is it miserable?  Miserable. Mural. It's he actually is tying Les Miserables to the Calais to migrants coming into Calais.  Beautiful. But as with always, as with Banksy's work, it's really graffiti and gets removed.  So there goes the Google guy, some dork in a backpack with a.  I don't know how that's really different than making a video of it.  And we're seeing a photo for that matter, but it's going to be part of the Cultural Institute Project and Street View.  So you can go back and see it. And there's a little QR code where it was.  So you can load up here. Here they go. Here go the bad, bad construction men who are going to take down the plywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Horses Mouth. Great movie. Love that movie. Reminds me of that spectacular movie.  Alec Guinness Alec Guinness is an artist who found great places to make art and buildings that were going to be torn down.  Call it was it. Callie Jimson, Jimson, Callie, Scully, Jimson, Gully, Gully, Gully, Jimson, Gully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great book, by the way, by who wrote Horses Mouth was I want to say Joyce Carol Oates, but I don't think it was.  I think we've even talked about the show before. Have we?  You know, I'm getting old, but what a great if you haven't you're not an Alec Guinness fanatic yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you care about creativity, it's one of the great movies, one of the great movies.  Horses Mouth and Day for Night true to Foes Joyce Carey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My two study movies. Yeah.  So Joyce Carey novel that was a great which I read, by the way, after seeing the movie.  Wait a minute. Can this be true? It says the screenplay was by Alec Guinness.  Wow. I had no idea.  Oh, that's Obi Wan Kenobi for those of you who never heard of him.  For this set. Yeah, this set.  You could I wonder if it's on Netflix or somewhere if you find it and watch it.  In fact, I might buy it because it's one of my favorite movies.  Is it an Ealing comedy? No.  But it's one of those great movies from 1958.  All right. You could tell we're drifting off here.  You look just under that last staff year ago.  Yeah, if you look just under that last discussion, there's even more information about the Oh, yeah, I've been using the Cultural Institute as my wallpaper on Chrome for some time.  This is a really great project. In fact, it was one of my picks.  I think was the was the was the wallpaper.  So if I do a new tab in Chrome, maybe I turned it off.  It's not doing it now, but it was for a while.  It's my wallpaper, my Chromebook.  They have a Chrome extension that will put images up from their cultural institute.  They're saving art, all kinds of art, including street art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They even have walking tours of many of the galleries around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it. The Google Cultural Institute.  Artist by artist.  That's the street art. Yeah, this is the street art collection.  But there's lots of collections. If you go, you can.  They do seem to favor graffiti and street art, but there's a lot of other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's amazing collection, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why? Why? Why do I know cultural?  I mean, my extension is turned off. Let me turn it back on, I guess.  Periodically go through and delete extensions. I have so many of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just put up the horse's mouth trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I'll tell you what. Let's let's take a break.  We'll wrap it up with our tip and our number.  Good. Good. Good. And then we will play a little bit of the horse's mouth trailer to inspire you.  It's about art. It's about an artist, an uncompromising artist.  An artist. And creativity.  And I love it because he never he never sold out. He lived in a houseboat.  Kelly Jimson. Never sold out.  The Google Cultural Institute. And it makes a wonderful Chrome extension.  Is it working now? Yeah, there it is.  So when I do a new tab, I get art every day, a different painting or work of art from the Google Cultural Institute.  I love that. Isn't that nice? Recommended as your you know, you can do lots of the problem with the Chromebook.  I don't know if you found this, Jeff, is that the wallpaper I wish it had. I like rotating wallpapers.  And I wish you had to see the wallpaper because it's always a browser.  Well, that's part of the problem, too. Yeah. There's always something on the screen.  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Time for a break.  And to talk about our mattress, because both Jeff and I are getting sleepy.  We're getting sleepy. We're having dreams of floating onto a Casper mattress.  I love their slogan, a life well slept.  Actually studies the Internet. Everybody now is saying sleep is more important for your long term health, for your for your ability to think for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait. When are we going to launch the show? New York Startups. Late spring.  If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what we have to do is Facebook, while we were on the show, revealed its earnings.  Oh, numbers came out. And they were amazing.  Sales rose 52 percent, 52 percent of smashing the forecasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is sales? That's ad sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's primarily right.  Five point eight four point eight four billion dollars.  And the street had guessed five point three seven billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, after Apple announces eighteen point four billion dollar profits in a quarter,  making a mere billion and a half seems so paltry.  Yeah, I know. But it's OK. It's good money.  It's nice work if you can get it. Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then the other numbers that came out and this is on Zuckerberg's own post on Facebook,  which is which is also like their one point five billion monthly Facebook users,  nine hundred million WhatsApp users. That'll pass a billion very fast.  Eight hundred million messenger. Right. So add those two numbers together.  Chimney, four million Instagram.  Phenomenal, just phenomenal.  Insane growth.  Nineteen million people so far connected via Internet dot org.  So it's still a small number while that goes through controversy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's still a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fifty million small businesses using pages.  That's that's to me a huge growth opportunity is I've been trying to argue with them  that local news sites should be should should be their sales agents for that.  And there's there's tremendous power there.  Five hundred million people use events. I don't even use events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's events? Oh, actually, I did use it because Scobel had his Scobel show last weekend.  And he used events to plan and pay for the whole thing. It actually worked quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's that's the numbers of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to apologize. I missed the most important story of the week.  If you've been watching the new X-Files, Mulder and Scully are using Nexus phones.  Of course, the truth is out there.  Yeah. Is that what phone is that? Is that a Nexus?  Six feet. Six feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The camera's off to the side. So it's a five. Oh, you're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. Right. So they're using the cheap one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
