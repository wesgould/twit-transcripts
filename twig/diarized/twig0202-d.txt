Anything you want.  Gina Trepanney is here.  Mother of Etta.  And Think Up.  And To Do Text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Dragons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Dragons.  She's a mother of dragons.  Daenerys Trepanneyan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love Daenerys.  Of House Trepanney.  Of House Trepanney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you a pretender to the throne?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like a lot has happened since the last time we talked.  We had...  The Red Wedding.  The Rism, the Red Wedding, the WWDC, all kinds of stuff happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Gina was wondering if we could talk about WWDC.  Certainly. Absolutely.  Let me introduce the other guy, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis,  professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  the author of What Would Google Do? and Public Parts,  and Gutenberg the Geek on Amazon.com.  And this is the core group, and I love this group,  just the three of us talking about whatever the hell we damn want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two old guys and a young whippersnapper talking about the world.  That's it. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina balances our curmudgeon-ness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know. I can be pretty curmudgeon-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a pretty heavy load there, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a tough job. Somebody's got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeffrey Jarvis, we're going to call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate that kid.  I hate him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hate that kid.  How could they not kill him by now?  I just thought he was going to get it.  I feel that he will at some point get it, but we'll have to wait until next season.  We're talking about Game of Thrones, which wrapped up its season on Sunday.  And we won't give you any spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Darian, why is there proof we can talk about anything on this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it a spoiler to say somebody's not going to get killed?  I think it is in this show.  I think it is in this show, because everybody...  Never mind.  Yeah, Waze. $1 billion plus. It's an Israeli company.  According to the rumor mill, which I think seems fairly accurate now,  Apple approached them early this year.  It would have been a good purchase for Apple.  They could have used the technology, which is essentially a crowdsourced traffic.  They could have used maps that were right.  Accurate maps because they're crowdsourced, and then great turn by turn,  but most importantly, crowdsourced traffic and road conditions and that kind of thing.  They offered, according to the rumor mill, half a billion, which Waze mocked.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha. Facebook came at them offering considerably more,  but as with all other Facebook acquisitions said, you'll have to move to Silicon Valley.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Then Google came and said, you can retain your autonomy, stay in Israel,  and we will give you more than a billion dollars.  And finally the deal was done. Waze is now Google Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Waze. I have learned. I'm leeked to it,  but it is the most remarkable thing I have learned lately that I do anything Waze tells me to do.  Oh yeah, you trust Waze.  I've been through terrible traffic jams, and I said, turn there? No, you're kidding.  If I ever not listen to Waze, I'm in trouble. If I listen to Waze, I've found all kinds of new routes.  Oh, I love it.  I've been driving the same route for 20 years.  Just two days ago, I found an entirely new route to work, and it saved me forever.  Waze is remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never the prettiest maps, but nevertheless, effective.  It's really a GPS device. Navigate gas.  There's some gaming you can have. If you help people with reports, you can get a better icon.  You can change your mood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Top 500 users get direct access to Waze employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. You could be a sunflower, a zombie, a cat, a dog, a male or a female LOL.  I love these. And there's some stuff. If you're a map editor, you get to be T-Rex, 8-bit robot.  So you see the other Wazers on the street. Even there's a scoreboard.  So this is how they gamify the idea of helping people out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get that part so much, but the real value is that because you're carrying it with you,  Waze knows what road you're on and how fast you're going, and thus gets the data together.  I wrote a business plan more than a dozen years ago, arguing that our radio reports on traffic are all gone off.  They know nothing.  And I had the idea that this was before smartphones.  So you could call in on your basic route that you had already registered and say how long it took you.  And you get value back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, imagine this in Google Now, right? Google Now does a little of this already.  It knows where you typically go. So it'll tell me, oh, it's the usual time you drive up to school.  Here's what it's going to take. And there's what the traffic is.  These are the reports. So I can show you, these are people who, these are Wazers who wave their hand across the phone  or tap it with three fingers and then dictate things like moderate traffic.  Some of this is from the average speed is just automatically collected.  But here's north of here, seven miles away, there's a police officer hidden.  Some of them are visible. Some of their invisible. Heavy traffic, complete standstill, vehicles stopped on shoulder.  These are very valuable. Pot hole on road.  Sometimes there'll be road debris or roadkill and it'll let you know.  And I think that's all very handy and has actually saved me.  And then, of course, because it knows where traffic is stopped, it will reroute you very effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, here's my question to Liam. Now that it's going to go into Google and let's assume that the usage of it just explodes,  then does every person using Waze go to the same alternate route and the alternate route becomes worse than the route you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is better to not share, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  I didn't think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never really used Waze because Android's navigation was always so great.  But do you think that it got as many users as it got because Apple, like for so long, didn't have navigation?  Do you feel like it was the it was like the nav app for Apple for iPhone, you know, before Apple launched there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, 50 million users, they claim.  And it was the number one mapping app after the Apple Map fiasco.  So for sure, it gained some users then, but it was already quite successful.  It was already a cult.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I started using it long before then.  I look forward to it being integrated into Google.  So I agree that they should retain autonomy as a company and and so forth and so on and maybe even a standalone app.  I think some people would prefer that.  But why not get that data into into Google Maps and Google Navigation?  That would be really fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both better maps and and your user data that Google now will know where you go shopping all the time.  It'll know all your routes that you take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple announced, you know, at the WWDC that many, many car companies were going to start incorporating Siri and Apple Maps into the car  so that Apple Maps would actually show up on the screen.  And I just don't know if that's such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do not want. Do not want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My next car, which is an Audi, has Google for a fee, by the way, Google Earth.  The fee is because you have to have connectivity in its maps.  And and actually one of our interns, dad has it and he says, don't get it.  It's very distracting because it's so pretty.  You go, oh, look what I look where I am.  So but if you could incorporate ways into an in-car system, your killer killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I was right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to have the app running and open running on your phone in order to know, like, oh, hey, there's a cop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which means you really need a dashboard mount and you need a, you know, a plug in and all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want a car that's going to be amplified.  I want an app. I want an Android car.  And, you know, if a brand goes only to Apple, honest to God, that's a reason for me not to buy it now because I'm kind of agree invested in Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody says in our chairman, I don't know if this is your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She because she's all about Android. She has to have an Android.  She's the queen of Android. Right.  She can't buy an Apple car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody said the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee has ways.  I didn't I don't know if that's the case.  That's the mayor. It's not a better car.  Shh. Yeah, I think I think you're right.  I don't want Apple Maps. Please.  I beg of you.  So I'd love to see and it's Google did not mention anything at Google.  I would have loved to have seen Google say, well, you got Ferrari, but we got Lamborghini.  You got Chevrolet, but we've got Ford.  Actually, Ford is the one stand out. They're using Microsoft's voice recognition and nuance.  So, you know, Apple doesn't even own its voice recognition.  Google is the only company I know of that owns its voice recognition.  Apple's using nuance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is about data source for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there was the theory was and I forgot who said this.  Maybe it was Renee Richie on Mac Break Weekly that perhaps Google, you know, turn by turn might have been a service that Google was licensing.  We don't know. Maybe they got it from Tele Nav or Nav Tech.  And perhaps that contract was up and Google said, boy, we'd like to have our own turn by turn.  Perhaps that was the reason for the acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense. Doesn't that kind of make sense?  I don't know. I think that's part of its data sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Gina, right? One is the maps.  Two is the turn by turn. Three is the consumer data.  Where do you go every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was John C. Dvorak said that credit to John for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you got paranoid about how Google was going to misuse this and use it to spy on all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Now, let me. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We did a great and I highly recommend this.  Steve Gibson's security now today, which will be available at Twitter TV slash S.N.  And on iTunes, it probably in a few hours, we'll have a text transcription tomorrow.  And I would I would actually send that to your member of Congress.  Steve has put together all the pieces of prism and thinks he has figured out what exactly is going on.  And I have to say his scenario fits perfectly with all the data points we have.  It's conjecture because, you know, for one thing, the Patriot Act and NSL at National Security Letters prevent people from saying what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Steve's being arrested as we speak. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and and Steve's basing this on the known leak, the known whistleblower from the NSA and AT&T six years ago, seven years ago, and how they were doing it.  And what he's done is he's extrapolated that into the present.  What would happen six years later? What would the NSA be doing?  And it does fit all the data, every single data point we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the only reason people haven't show, you know, pardon me, the greatest part of the show to me was at the end when Steve, of all people said, well, if the NSA asked me to design this, this is what I do.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a little bit technical.  So it's the kind of thing that you're probably not going to see mainstream media explain.  Oh, God, no, they'll screw it up.  Yeah. So the basic the gist of this is no, the NSA doesn't, in fact, need to have access to Google servers, which Google, Facebook and everybody else have said, no, they don't have access to our servers.  They they tap in upstream.  In fact, they tap in right at the point where Google would connect to the Internet backbone, where they would get their Internet service.  You don't even need to let Google know you're doing that.  You could do it with NSL's to and this is what AT&T was giving the NSA.  AT&T in 2006 whistleblower revealed had a secret room in its headquarters in San Francisco where all World Net, which was AT&T's service Internet service traffic was being collected by the NSA just split it off.  They took and the reason he says called prism is because this is fiber optic cable, which they have split just as a prism splits light into a room where we collect it all.  And his thesis and I think it's probably accurate, although we may never know because nobody's telling the truth in this or at least nobody's revealing what they know in this is that they basically collecting everything, storing it.  And then if a time comes, they want to know, well, what was, you know, bad guy a up to last year?  They've got all the data.  That's why they're building a giant seven set of collection facility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the slide had two parts, right?  Prism was the lower part of that slide, but the other part of the slide talked about tapping straight into communications.  Right. And so there were separate things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there but yes.  And what prism is, is, is, and he also explained why you would want to do it right at the juncture of Google and the public Internet, because you can then say this came.  We know this came through Google and then you can subpoena or NSL Google and say, who was that?  So so they need to know where it came from.  They could, you know, I said, why don't you just tap it upstream?  Get the backbones.  That's all you need, because you can't tell where it came from.  So if you can say, hey, this this was Google, we can subpoena Google.  This was Facebook.  No problem. We know how to get that information out of Facebook and then put the puzzle together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He theorizes this because in that previous testimony, as I understand it, Leo, right, that there was a secret room built at a Folsom Street facility.  Right.  Where you knew where it was going next.  And thus, that's where the theory comes from.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more. Yeah.  I mean, that and that's known.  That was exactly what the NSA was doing with AT&T, the AT&T whistleblower.  That's that's fairly well exposed.  So it makes perfect sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, dumb question. Sorry.  So this means that they're capturing the bits going out of all of Google's data centers across the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've they've well, not across the world in the US, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, all right. So all of Google's data centers, even in the US, they're splitting off.  So they're getting the bits coming out of getting the raw bits coming out of Google servers and they're collecting all of them.  And they're able to assemble them into something coherent enough to target individuals.  I mean, of course, that's possible.  I just don't have that much.  It's a great task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's big data. Right.  And we're getting better and better at that.  I think that in 2006, that they were looking for specific things.  They weren't collecting everything.  But we know that the NSA is building a giant million and a half square foot facility in Utah with storage capacity of seven zettabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But just the job of reassembling those bits into something.  Here's my theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's my theory.  And this goes back to the bits are assembled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't think I mean, there's an email.  There's you know, there's a conversation.  It's not like they're completely random.  They're assembled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're assembled in that they're linear.  Right. There's some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you could search it for you can do a search for an IP address.  You could do a search.  I think we know a word.  Yeah, I think we know how to do this.  I think this data big this is just big data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, Gina, what also is happening is that and this is the reason that they have the previously warrantless wiretapping, I think, just guessing to and also the Verizon data is they're looking for anomalies to patterns.  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  We normal people are the pattern.  They want to see anomalies where things are happening oddly.  And you're right, Leo, could go to an odd address.  It could go to a word or sequence of words are looking for.  And then they can back up to track that down.  They're not trying to reassemble the entire Internet conversation.  They don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want to save it.  They want to save it so that they could go back.  They're gripping the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gripping it in the most primitive way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're gripping it.  But I think they're doing more.  You know, for instance, you know, your bank will let you know if suspicious activity is going on in your credit card.  Right.  Well, in order for that to happen, there is a third party service provider, very big third party service provider that gets all the transactions and looks for anomalies, looks for certain patterns.  That's a lot of data, data, by the way, which I'm sure is also being collected by the NSA.  And they can see in that stream, they can see anomalies and patterns.  That's just you know that that's just big.  That's just big iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how that's how you get that call that says, hey, you know, we just saw some weird stuff.  Did you just buy sneakers and three gallons of gas?  And that's because they can do pattern recognition and stuff.  And believe me, credit monitoring all the credit card transactions going on in the US, I can I once knew the number.  It's a large number.  It's many, many bytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I guess I guess I was thinking that there'd be that structured data, you know, where they have triggers and queries constantly running and monitoring.  But just getting the stream of bits come across the wire.  Right. Like this is this is comparable to what Google was accidentally capturing with the street view cars.  Right.  And they were capturing the data that was going across the wireless networks.  Right. Which was we all agree was basically a scobbly book.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, those were random packets.  This is not random packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the whole thing.  This is the whole thing.  They're capturing the whole thing.  They got the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I know no one knows what they're doing with it, but I think Steve's supposition is probably accurate that they're just collecting it.  They may do some data analysis on it.  But the other reason that they want to just have it is so that at a later date, should they begin an investigation, they can they can pull in the threads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw one reference, Leo, to somebody doing a calculation of what it would take to store all that and the cost of that is pretty tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, IBM has a page called Big Data in which they say we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day.  2.5 quintillion bytes of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There goes another number of the week.  Was that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be a good one.  90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone, according to IBM.  That's everything.  That's posts to social media, climate sensors, that's purchase records, GPS signals.  And IBM says we can analyze this.  12 terabytes of tweets a day.  350 billion annual meter readings.  You know, this is what IBM specializes in.  In fact, one of the things I read said that Watson has been repurposed to do exactly this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Watson has been turned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watson which won Jeopardy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right. Watson has been turned.  But it's the same thing Watson was doing to win Jeopardy.  So I don't think any of that.  In fact, there really shouldn't be a surprise because, you know, there's been this this move in this direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick question, Leo.  If I encrypt my queries on the browser, is that of any use to me, you say then?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah.  So while they could be doing a man in the middle attack, that may not, we're not presuming that.  And that would be an awfully a lot of work to do for all of these transactions.  So encrypted data, SSL data and so forth is probably okay.  But Steve points out all your email is unencrypted.  Otherwise, people wouldn't be able to read it.  Oh, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't this part of the reason that you think looking back now when Google decided, okay, it's time to go ahead and go to HTTPS and encrypt more stuff.  Right.  You almost wonder where they felt they thought, you know, we can't say anything, but folks, you really ought to do this.  Well, there were other reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that might be one of the reasons.  And, you know, for years I used PGP.  I would sign on my email with PGP and encourage people to encrypt the email back to me.  I mean, literally for 10 years.  My thesis was, look, if everybody, even innocent parties encrypt email, then encryption is a good thing.  Then encryption itself wouldn't be seen as a sign of guilt.  Right.  So we should all routinely encrypt.  Maybe now people will take that more seriously.  Glenn Greenwald, when he quoted Edward Stodin, Stodin said they can literally watch your ideas form as you type.  And that would be the case, not even if without access to Google's servers, as long as they're, you know, at the access point to the public Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing, too, about that is that is that Snowden wanted to contact Greenwald and wanted to do a key exchange.  Right.  Well, had no idea how to do it.  Snowden made a video to convince me he still didn't do it.  It was only when the video maker came to him and said, listen, you really ought to pay attention to this.  And so somebody made fun of him on Twitter.  And he said, no, I've learned now.  I know I learned my lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New York Times. This is from the New York Times.  IBM's Watson, the supercomputing technology.  The New York Times wrote this.  The defeated human Jeopardy champions in 2011 is a prime example of the power of data intensive artificial intelligence.  Watson style computing analysts said is precisely the technology that would make the ambitious data collection program of the NSA seem practical.  Computers could instantly sift through the mass of Internet communications data, see patterns of suspicious online behavior and thus narrow the hunt for terrorists.  Both the NSA and the CIA have been testing Watson in the last two years, said a consultant who has advised the government and asked not to be identified.  I think now we know it's Snowden.  So they've been they've actually used Watson directly for this.  So does that answer your question, Gina?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I realize it was kind of a dumb question.  This is this is where we've been headed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it looks like this is this is what Edda should study in school.  Looks like it's not going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what do you do?  Do you what do you think?  Should we all routinely encrypt our emails?  And it's easy to do, by the way.  It's trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PGP is trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PGP or certificate based encryption or GNU Privacy Guard, which is the open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The providers should do it for us.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Gmail could launch that right now and everybody would turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem with that.  No, I guess you could do that as long as it was Gmail to Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I'm sending to Yahoo mail from Gmail, unless Yahoo and Gmail make a deal.  I mean, I've used hushmail.  Now, the other part of this, of course, is analysis of patterns.  And this was, you know, one of the defenses the government, including President Obama, had was, well, we're not listening to your conversations.  We're just monitoring who you call and when.  And that's another part of this is they maybe don't even need to see in the email if they can see the patterns of communication.  There's a lot there that you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, they see it in a couple of ways.  The more one they say, this person is starting to communicate with this person, right?  That's the more obvious.  But the less obvious is the search for anomalies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, don't you remember in Zero Dark Thirty how we caught Obama?  I mean, Obama Osama bin Laden.  You know, it was watching how communication went in and out of that compound and and and finding the career.  These are they didn't even see what the communications were.  They didn't need to.  They were able to backtrack from who was talking to whom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, this argument that Snowden has blown the lid off how it works.  Osama bin Laden wasn't trusting email anyway.  He was using human courage.  Human courage. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we still and they were still able to track down.  By the way, somebody in the chat room just pointed out, Gina, you wrote an article on Lifehacker in 2006.  How to encrypt your email.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So 2006 ago, I did.  I said I did write a post about how to actually did I write this?  No, I think.  No, no, no. I edited this.  It's an old article.  So it shows me as the author.  It was actually Jason Thomas wrote it.  You can see his byline at the bottom.  I did publish that email.  I always sort of aspired to and fantasized about using PGP every day and I never quite got around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I signed my email from, you know, all my email was signed for two reasons.  One to prove that it was from me because the signature was my key, my public key, but also to give people the opportunity to encrypt email back.  And I only received a handful of encrypted emails from people.  You have to exchange keys if you want to have a encrypted conversation.  That's why Snowden was trying to tell Greenwald, hey, give me your key.  You got to do this thing so I can talk to you.  And of course, like most people, Glenn Greenwald had no idea what he was talking about.  In Microsoft products and Thunderbird and others, you can use a certificate, much like the SSL certificates, even a self-signed certificate.  So and there's enigma.  There's a lot of there's a lot of good choices out there for doing this.  I wonder, you know, the polls show that most Americans say, hey, you know, you have to give up a little privacy to fight terrorism, to keep us safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that could change based on further revelations and on enough people in Congress getting mad.  But Congress is so wacky.  I mean, Peter King is saying arrest Glenn Greenwald for nothing to do.  Right. Nobody can agree on what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing to see Glenn back agreeing with liberals.  It's a wacky world.  No. Yeah, I saw somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's just yeah.  And it's also, as I mentioned on Sunday on the on Twitter, a litmus test for where your politics lie, how you react to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is and it isn't because, again, it's people from from left and right can be on either side here.  It's my argument is that the discussion needs to rise up again to the level of principles.  Right.  That the principle that our physical mail is private and can only be opened by government with a warrant should hold with all of our other private communications by any means whatsoever.  And that's that principle isn't there.  There should be a principle of government being transparent, except when it needs not to be.  And there are, by God, a lot of instances when it needs to be secret.  I buy that.  But we're not having the discussion at the level of principles.  And we're having, you know, all a bunch of exceptions around rules.  And that leads to mistrust, because when you don't know what's going on, you're going to default to mistrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, but I'm glad that we're starting to understand it and talk about it.  Yes, I'm too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does this I'm curious, Jeff, does does does prison make you think twice about living on a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I'll get in trouble for saying this, but this is the Eric Schmidt rule.  You know, what am I ashamed of doing?  Uh huh.  I already am cautious.  Everyone I know is cautious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I just point out that the J. Edgar Hoover spied on Martin Luther King and collected a fairly large FBI dossier on him?  I don't know what it's spying on.  Well, I'm just saying that the government can decide who it's who doesn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and it can do that anyway.  And you may say I'm not doing anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Martin Luther King was doing anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the question is, does the cloud make that necessarily any more different?  My behavior makes it easy.  I wasn't going to send an email.  I mean, the rule is very simple.  Don't send an email to anyone that if you're afraid of it getting passed on to anyone.  Period.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, anything you I guess at this point we have to assume anything we do on the Internet is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm not willing to go that far because, you know, we have to be careful here of Google might be able to be.  I mean, the government might be getting that traffic by, but they're not recreating the entire Internet and seeing everything we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're not posting it online.  They're keeping it to themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the most important thing, I think, is the worst part of this entire story from our perspective, the technology perspective, was the Washington Post screwing up and presuming that there were direct ties into Google, Facebook, and all servers so the government could make queries whenever they wanted.  Simply not true.  It took like two days of vehement denials from companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but now you understand what the confusion was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was more an issue of understanding how technology works than it was inaccurate.  And this was Snowden's assertion is they can watch what you're doing as you're typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he wasn't asserting anything.  The PowerPoint said something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not untrue.  Both are true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Steve's presumption, and I agree with that.  But the point is, back to Gina's question, back to your assumption that there's no such thing as private.  The odds that the government could possibly care about recreating any single email of mine are next to nil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if they wanted to build a case against you at any point.  Well, they could do that anyway.  The issue here is not the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The issue here is the FISA court being secret and members of Congress being gagged.  The issue here is the oversight of government and a lack of transparency.  This is what I'm worried about with all this.  It's that once again, technology gets to be made into the boogeyman here, when in fact it's government.  I've said often on the show.  Oh, I agree.  Government fancies itself the protector of our privacy.  It is the worst enemy of privacy.  It is a government we have to be careful about.  And I don't say this libertarian.  I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat, folks.  Let's make this clear.  But I emphasize this really, really strongly.  But what's happening in the discussion is, oh, technology is bad.  Internet's bad for you.  Google's bad.  And so what we're seeing also in other countries, they're saying quite properly and raged, oh, they don't care about spying on us.  They just care about spying on the US, which of course is where the law hinges.  But what happens now is you have European officials coming after and saying, they were already after the idea, and Canadian officials too, that data stored in the US was in danger of going to the government.  Well, that affects Google.  That affects Facebook.  That affects the internet.  That affects the industry that we're trying to build on.  And that affects our country and things like jobs.  So there's an ongoing damage that I don't think has been covered as a story yet to the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Steve referred to this.  Our European allies are very upset about this.  Yeah.  The Prime Minister of Finland said this is probably a violation of Finnish law.  They're going to go to our friend, Neely Cruz, who is one of the commissioners of the EU and the woman who's been very actively pursuing Google and others for privacy.  She would be the attack dog at something like this.  It's damaging to our relationships in the rest of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terrible. Just terrible.  And I think that's not been calculated.  I haven't seen anyone do that story yet.  And, you know, as always, I'm in the position of defending the internet and defending Google and I'll get in trouble for that.  But whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, as it turns out, Google is probably given Steve's explanation, which just makes such sense.  Google's not lying when they say, no, they don't have access to our servers, nor is Facebook.  Google's not lying when they say, no, we don't have a secret drop box for them.  Doesn't matter.  All they have to do is tap Google.  They're wiretapping Google and getting all of it.  Yeah, they're wired to right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm going to be really super provocative here.  So you're OK with the idea that anything you send send or share to Google or that anytime you use a Google service that you're in essence sharing that information at the NSA as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not.  No, I'm disagreeing with Leo that I should assume that it is shared.  What I'm saying is I'm already careful because of human beings about what I send on the Internet.  Whenever I write an email, the rule is if you write an email, you better be comfortable with it being on page one of the New York Times and didn't portray us.  That's right.  Yep.  So that was already my rule.  Now, I'm sure I do stupid things and I'm sure there's plenty of things that I do that would embarrass me just because I'm being dumb.  But that's already my rule of care.  And it's not because of the technology.  It's not because of government.  It's because of other humans could hit CCL.  Yes.  So that's all I'm saying, Gina.  No, no, I don't believe privacy is dead.  B, I value privacy.  So, C, I'm not saying that I've already given up on my privacy.  I'm just saying that I had already set my rules of care here.  Now, those are rules we have to give all of our children.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It also weakens our argument with countries like China when we say, hey, you guys stop hacking us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the next thing that came out today from Snowden, Leo.  In Snowden said there were 61,000 hacking operations right now from the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's cyber attacks going on from the US, not only to the outside world, but he even said to you inside the US.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, countries we're not at war with, right?  Get a CS degree, work for the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And once again, we should be a nation of principles.  And supposedly what we're run on is principles, and that's what we can harken to.  But we can't harken to them when what we do on the basis of those or in violation of those is secret.  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  We will talk.  Hashbooks come to Facebook.  WWDC, Gina has some thoughts about the new iOS 7 and other stuff.  Are you going to buy that new Mac Pro, the Darth Vader Mac Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, that was that was the part of the keynote that I was like, no, that looks amazing.  I'm excited about the airs, too.  I think I'm going to get an air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I already bought an air, but I haven't had an air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That Mac Pro is like, oh, it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if I were a developer or somebody who is a pro user, I'd be a little reluctant to purchase it.  We'll talk about that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good place for your cat to sleep, though.  Nice warm spot right at the top there.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.  LegalZoom is not a law firm.

You could do it right now.  You'll be done by the end of the day.  If you've got a family, you really ought to have a last will.

So, day before yesterday, Monday, was Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.  Gina's a developer, develops for iOS.  You didn't try to get tickets, I presume.  Awfully hard. You know, what do they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't even try.  These developers...  It was like 70 seconds.  Yeah. Boom. They go so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But to Apple's credit, like Google, where there were so many people who wanted to go,  they streamed the keynote and they're streaming a lot of the sessions.  If you're a registered Apple developer, you can get those on the WWDC app.  So, they're being pretty public about all that information.  We can't report on it because if you have an NDA, you can't talk about it.  So, I can only...  And I'm not an NDA developer, so I don't know what they're saying because I can't see it.  But we did, we were all able to see the keynote address.  New MacBook Airs, no new Retina, no...  And surprisingly, no new iMacs.  Only new MacBook Airs.  And based on the Haswell chipset, so you get nine hours of battery life on the 11-inch,  12 hours of battery life on the 13-inch.  Wow.  And a new Mac Pro that's coming sometime later this year, made in the US of A, assembled in the USA.  That's nice.  Yeah. It's an amazing process.  It's extruded aluminum that's then anodized to look black.  It will be a beautiful thing, but you know, you can't upgrade anything in it.  Except the RAM, I guess.  You can't... The GPU, the graphics processors, two of them,  AMD graphics processors, soldered onto the motherboard.  Ah.  Steve lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is why you wouldn't buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it will look beautiful if that's all you need.  Right. Ever.  But if you're going to have anything else, you've got to buy expensive cables, lightning, you know,  Thunderbolt 2 cables, plus external stuff.  You're going to have all this stuff hanging off of this beautiful thing.  It's going to look worse.  It's going to look like, you know, an octopus.  But if you can get by, you know, I'm thinking it's going to be a great alternative to the Mac Mini  if you've got $5,000, $6,000 to burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do we know what the price is going to be?  No.  We don't have an idea yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I can pretty much guarantee you we're in the $4,000 to $6,000 range.  I mean, there's no way.  It will drive up to four 4K monitors.  If you had a little money left over, you want to spend a couple of...  Three? Only three?  Only three.  Only three.  Sorry.  Only three 4K monitors.  Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, because a few cinema displays, throw those in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a couple of cinema displays.  Some 4Ks.  Ten grand for a workstation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  This is not for somebody who doesn't have the money.  This is for somebody who gets their boss to pay, is who this is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was...  Wow.  I mean, I think the design is really cool.  I actually kind of liked...  I forget what his name, the presenter who said, you know, can't innovate my ass.  I thought that was kind of funny.  That's Phil Schiller, yeah.  Phil Schiller, yeah.  I thought that was funny.  I love to see new Apple designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's a really beautiful design.  It reminds me a lot of the Cube, which I bought.  I just...  I don't think it's...  I don't think it's going to do very well.  I've never had a Mac Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might do a Hackintosh at some point, or even that is...  That's what's going to happen.  Yeah, that's a little bit of work because things break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's unreliable, and maybe if it's your production machine, you don't want to have a Hackintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How big is the business for them to keep investing in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's tiny.  But it's important for a few reasons.  One, a lot of people in Apple are pro users, right?  So, they can't just dump that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in short, Leo, this is Apple's prism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean...  Pixel.  Pixel, thank you.  Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of them B words.  Not their prism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not their prism.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a pixel in some ways.  Yeah, I think you're right.  That's an interesting analogy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that it has more than a browser on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey.  Sorry, sorry.  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are you, the hang around Leo?  But if you're a video editor, you're going to have to buy expensive new Thunderbolt arrays,  Thunderbolt cables.  I mean, it's just not cheap.  There's no way this is going to be...  You're going to end up spending 10 grand for a system.  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not lusted after a desktop machine in 10 years.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  That was a thing, right?  I'm going to get the Air.  I'm not going to get a Mac Pro.  But yeah, I was like, wow, that's one good looking little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iOS 7, a lot of controversy.  Joshua Topolsky said it was childish, ugly.  There's a lot of energy put into translucency.  Boy, it's very Android-like.  I mean, you even have a dedicated flashlight button.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too bad for all those flashlight apps.  We talked about this a little bit on All About Android last night.  There's a little bit of arrow, like Windows arrow going on with the blur and the transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, I asked Renee Richie, who's a developer, and that is real time.  And you can see it if you look at it.  The effects are real time, but based on what's underneath.  When you slide up or slide down that notification panel, that real time translucency, that's a lot of work.  Oy.  And there it is, the flashlight icon.  But look at those icons.  Let's go down and go back a little bit to chat, if you will.  I know that's a video on Apple's site.  There's Johnny Ive.  Here it is, slide to unlock.  It has to tell you that, by the way.  Yeah, but it's slide up now, which is...  Okay, so look at those icons at the bottom there.  Flashlights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flashlights.  Clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well good.  Yeah, that's what that is.  That's a clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clock, calculator, and camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, very good.  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And actually, that looks different than what's on my phone right now.  So they've actually changed it.  I just don't have AirDrop and AirPlay, and I've enabled that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, AirDrop is for contacts only.  As you can see, I've been listening to Get Lucky from Daft Punk.  Actually, on this phone, can you show my phone?  I've been listening to...  That's my bitch.  Kanye West and Jay-Z.  Hey!  I don't know whose phone this is, but I'm giving it back quick.  This is very Android-like, these buttons up at the top.  Airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, do not disturb, and rotation lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah, but you know, this is...  So I think they actually did this...  This is blasphemy, I know.  But I think they did the control center a little bit better than Android has done with the quick toggle shade.  It's pretty.  Because it's pretty...  There's the transparency eye candy, but there's also just fewer taps.  So like the brightness slider, for example.  On Android, you'd have to tap brightness, and then you get the slider.  The slider's right there here in the control center.  And I really like that you swipe up, so it's one motion.  Whereas on Android, in Jelly Bean, you swipe down, then you have to tap the button to flip the notification shade around to get to the quick toggle, because Google now is the swipe up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I should point out that that's because you're using vanilla Android.  Here it is on the Samsung, where you have the brightness right there.  In fact, this very much looks like...  This looks almost identical to TouchWiz.  Oh good, another suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny.  I was thinking about how there was such a strong emotional response to the iOS 7 redesign.  People either loved it or they hated it.  And I was thinking about how Android's such a chameleon, right?  Like it looks different depending on what kind of phone you have, what skin you're running, and what widgets you've got.  There is no Android look, right?  There is no unified Android look, right?  But there is a unified iOS look and people are very, very attached to it.  And people flip out when things change.  So I think, you know, folks really responded emotionally about this, which is really a testament to the product.  People love iOS and you just wouldn't quite get that reaction with Android.  So yeah, it's true.  Or the pathology of the Apple fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One or the other.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, listen, there's Android fanboys too.  You know, I felt like the people, the crowd I run around with on Google Plus and stuff, they're mostly Android fans.  They're mostly Android users.  And I heard a lot of people saying, oh, they're just ripping off Android.  I don't know if that's true.  I mean, I think, and I was saying this in all about Android last night.  I think we are sort of converging upon a particular feature set.  But, you know, I think that Apple's MO, unlike Google's, is to kind of work really slowly in secret and iterate and kind of slowly release what seem to be very basic features like copy and paste.  But they take their time and they kind of, you know, that measure twice, cut once thing.  And so it's interesting to me to see what they come up with.  When Google's quick toggle settings page in the notification shade and the quick toggle settings area came out, I thought to myself, this is crazy.  That button doesn't represent anything.  Why do I have to tap so many times in order just to go into airplane mode?  And so I think that Apple did some nice stuff here.  It doesn't feel innovative.  Well, that parallax effect.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's copying.  I said there's copying.  There's what did I say?  Copying.  Now I forgot my own aphorism.  Catch up.  There's some catch up they're playing here.  There's some copying and then there's some innovation.  And it's probably an equal measure.  You know, I have no problem with this.  This is how it should be.  Each company should copy one another.  And do we iterate and get the best possible product?  Because that's what's best for consumers.  But I think why it irritates people is that Apple has been so aggressively suing companies like Samsung who do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the other thing, though, the guys.  And I say this is no insult to Apple, but nothing wowed me in this.  This was a shrug to me.  And the truth is, I haven't been wowed by anything new on a phone in what, two years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  May not be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I think your point about, you know, we're arriving at the feature set is right for both sides.  And a smartphone is a smartphone is a smartphone now.  Yeah, there's differences and yeah, you have choice.  And I love the choice.  But there's really very little major difference.  You know, there were some surprises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For instance, we thought maybe they would add and maybe they will in the next iPhone.  And this is just the preview.  Remember, this isn't the version of iOS that will ship in the fall.  But they mentioned Passbook.  Not at all.  They didn't mention any.  They didn't mention how I might be able to use an NFC like technology.  There's a lot of stuff missing.  Passbook was one of the big stories a year ago, and they didn't say one word about it this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other big story out of this one was the quiet mention that Siri goes to Bing.  Yes.  Works so well for your Maps, Apple.  Yes.  No wonder you're doing it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's still Google.  Safari uses Google as its default search.  But Siri now uses Bing for web searches.  Now, somebody said yesterday that that's because Siri is a partner deal.  So all of the tools that Siri uses are basically financial arrangements that Apple makes with other companies like Wolfram Alpha.  So and Bing, presumably.  So presumably Bing just gave more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wouldn't be very aptly, would it?  Well, no, that's how Siri works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Siri is about partnerships.  But Apple shouldn't.  I think the I do not like the new color palette at all.  And I don't I think it's a little candy colored for the default icons.  It's a little Nicki Minaj to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  FaceTime is bright green and this Safari icon is pretty bad.  The right phone and iTunes.  It's very bright.  Look how bright it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, but that's a choice.  That's it.  That's called design.  You make a choice.  And as they showed in that video at the very beginning, they really at the very beginning, Apple set the tone for this.  Do we have that video that Apple ran at the very beginning of the conference?  Because they essentially said having having a lot they really kind of in a way was a backhand at Android Android.  Having lots of choices does not mean good design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Confusing abundance or quality.  It was like confusing abundance with choice.  I forget how exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Let me see if I can find that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was if everybody is making everything.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If everyone is busy making everything, I call that innovation and excitement.  How can anyone perfect anything?  They're really making a pitch for we're going to choose.  We start to confuse convenience, they say, with joy.  So we're going to choose joy for you.  Abundance with choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this all struck me as marketing blather blather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  What this is, is this is Johnny Ive.  This is designer point of view.  What it is, what designers think, rightly or wrongly, is we know we'll do it for you.  You don't understand design.  We do.  Let us do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the cathedral, the cathedral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's it.  It's completely legitimate point of view.  And what's nice is we have the bizarre to choose from as well.  We've got Android.  And so I don't have a problem with there are a thousand knows.  Those are all those Android devices for every.  Yes, we simplify.  We perfect.  We start over until everything we touch.  Enhances each level.  You could stop it.  I know.  I hate that.  That's a little schmaltzy, but it is the point of view of all designers.  I have taste.  You don't let me design.  I see this all the time.  Please don't tell me what to do when which makes them so much fun to work with.  No, and that's why people don't like them.  But I also completely respect it when Rand bigger did the next logo was his name.  Paul Rand, who was it that did the next logo?  Yeah.  He said Steve Jobs said, I want you to design the next logo.  Rand said, I'd be glad to, but I don't want any input.  I'm not going to show you specs.  I'm not going to show you prototypes.  I'm going to give it to you.  It's done.  That's it.  It for $100,000, by the way.  And now it's a beautiful logo, but this is that's exactly the attitude.  No, no, no, no.  This is not a collaborative process.  This is what you get.  And of course, he's a design superstar.  As you say, lunch man in the chat room, he can say that and he could charge a hundred thousand for it.  And Jobs was glad to do it.  Now, that's interesting because Jobs sees always saw himself as the same way.  You know, I have taste.  Anyway, I don't like it, but I don't care because I'm not using it.  I'm an Android fanboy.  I love Android.  You don't like it because of the color scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I'm holding a piece of cotton candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talk about talking about emasculating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When the new iPhone comes out, you're not going to you're not going to get one, Leo, just to kind of know I have to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's my job.  Of course, we'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't I don't currently use my iPhone five.  It's sitting on the shelf.  I don't want seven that made me say, oh, I think I got to switch back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So then, Gina, to your point, what's the what could the hardware do in the new phone that would be so amazing that I would say, oh, I got to switch back.  And it's a little hard to imagine.  Here's the image that really says it all to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nicki Minaj, iOS seven together.  I'll say about about about the iPhone.  I'm not going to switch from Android and this might be blasphemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there is one thing that I will say about the iPhone, and that is that the phone is always very responsive, very smooth, takes great photos.  They're just there are times on Android, even with pretty up to date hardware where you get the spinner, you get the force close, things feel a little jaggy.  I got to go into what processors are running and kill them off.  The iOS experience, even with this beta is is is much is very smooth.  There's no question that the one thing that I've been banging with Android is that the camera, the camera experience, I still can get really good photos with the iPhone with one hand barely trying than I can with my with my Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Galaxy S4 has some huge bug, which means that the phone lags and sometimes resets the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can't have lag when you.  Yeah.  So those are the only two things.  Those are really the only two things.  Look, I said I think I tweeted this one after the keynote.  I feel like iOS 7 makes my phone look brand new and it makes my app look ancient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like I'm definitely going to have to dive in iOS and just make my I was wondering because yeah, I guess all the app developers are scrambling now because they have a palette.  Apple gave him a palette.  And I in effect, if I look at this iPhone 5, which is running iOS 7 and I and I look at.  How do you unlock it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's aligned to the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't it used to be that way?  You look at the old some of the old icons, they just look wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, no, I know. My icon too is so detailed.  It looks completely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Completely. So everybody's going to ways.  Fortunately, is looking great, but everybody else is going to have to redo their icons.  In fact, when this seems to be too bright, it's like there's no contrast in.  This is the dock compared to what's going on up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm way too embedded in the Google sort of ecosystem to switch back to iPhone.  And I don't have a desire to.  But that's the only thing about I cracked my Galaxy Nexus screen.  So I'm actually going to get one.  Yeah, yeah.  You get the one. All right.  Yeah, I'm excited.  Are you going to get the vanilla one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting the vanilla one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to get the Google edition.  I know Leo said so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what I would do.  I would get the regular edition because you'll be able to put the Google edition ROMs on it.  You'll have in other words, you'll have choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I could write. I could get the developers.  This is the thing. I have one of these pay as you go T-Mobile deals.  I don't want to get a contract.  I could just get the developer version, the HTC developer version, which comes with all the HTC stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't even need to do that because HTC makes it easy to boot unlock any HTC one.  So I immediately rooted in mine and put a put a weird ROM on it that gives me four to two.  But since it's the international ROM, but the ability to do that as opposed to using getting the vanilla one from Google, you never have access to since at all.  Unless HTC puts it out, but they say they're not going to put out the Zoe, you know, the camera and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still don't understand why they don't make those apps available separately because the more people download them, the more it proves how wonderful they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say they can't because they're tied so closely into additional stuff that's built into sense, which is very possible.  For instance, you have to have a different gallery app to understand the Zoe's and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they couldn't restrict it to just the one, right?  I don't think you can restrict apps to a particular device.  I think it's just a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure you can. All the time there are devices.  I can't I can't because it says no, you can't wallet won't let you do it right based on hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, yeah. So yeah, you're right.  You're right. I'm going to look in the so they could do that, right?  They could just say just the HTC one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. I would get I would get a normal one.  And then because we I'm sure that the Google ROM will be available within minutes.  So the so root it put put clockwork mod on it and ROM manager.  And then when the then you have everything, anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm so lazy, though, that I might just want to just get the updates from Google, not have to root.  I just you know, I don't know.  I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about this phone is still is still functioning.  And I still got a couple of couple a couple of days time to think about days.  I got time to think about it before before I have to I can pull it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I go I'm very I'm waffling back and forth between the Galaxy S4 and the HTC one.  The one is beautiful hardware. There's no doubt about it. It's beautiful.  I like the camera. I love the front facing speakers that fit in the finish.  Beautiful battery.  And well, and I've got the battery now to a decent amount.  But I still was that because you gave up stuff.  You know, it's because I put a lot of doohickeys on there.  OK, I had to root it.  But the problem and this is, by the way, Apple addressed this when they're talking about iOS seven.  This whole idea of app nap and coalescing wake locks and things like that.  That's the problem with Android is that any application can wake up the phone even when the screen's off.  Hey, I got to get some data. So basically the phone remains in a wake state all the time.  And the battery goes Facebook's is the worst.  You know, one of the best things you can do to improve battery life on Android is to either remove Facebook or at the very least tell it stop getting updates.  So that's the trick on Android is to tell things stop getting updates.  And iOS can do it by fiat because Apple really controls the OS.  And they're just going to say, hey, you know, you go through us if you want an update and we're going to make sure we coalesce those.  So they should be able to get great battery life on iOS seven.  That should make it even better.  And so, yeah, on the other hand, and this is kind of cheesy hardware, the Galaxy S4.  Yeah.  I don't know. There's no perfect phone yet.  I'm still waiting. You know what I'm really interested in?  And Motorola asked us to a special briefing, I think, next week or the week after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the Moto Moto X. That's the one I'd wait for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I were you, Gina. Yeah, I think it's imminent. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have to hang in there. That's going to be the Nexus four next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is that? What is that again? Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They when did they invite me to it? They invited me to a briefing and I have to assume it was for that.  I'm not going because I don't go to press briefings. But they still call that they still calling it.  They're not saying anything. Well, they are. They did call X, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're calling it Moto X. But it's not a droid.  Oh, they were calling it the X phone and now they're just calling it Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that without knowing anything about it, potentially that could be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem with doing all that Android is every week I get to hear about the phone that's right on the horizon.  You're immediately going to have purchase regret.  I like Android. Choice. Choice and abundance and abundance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with abundance. I'm a nice Italian boy.  Somebody eat your meatballs. You might have to wait till you can't wait till October.  If it's not till September or October, that's too long. Yeah, no, that is too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it breaks my heart every time I look at the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll see. Let's take a break. When we come back to Google change log,  Gina Trapani will tell us everything that's happened at Google. And it's not a whole lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a lot this week. Really thin this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're kind of resting after a very productive Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're trying to snoop on us all. So that's what they're going to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have to. That's the beauty of Steve's hypothesis.  They don't have to do anything. They don't even have to know about it.  And you know, they did. Google has asked, as have some other companies,  to be able to be more open about what they're being asked for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they want to enhance the transparency report. Let us talk about these NSL.  In fact, we should have Brian Fitzpatrick on some. I'd love to.  Because he worked on the transparency board. He's the data liberation guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Love him. Would you put make a note of that, Chad? Let's get let's get Brian on.  Fits, they call it. Fits. Fits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, we should we should note here that Twitter's role here and Twitter, though,  befuddles me sometimes with its relationship with developers and users.  Whatever it was, Twitter's been left on this list because Twitter has really held on principle and try to hold back.  Now, Twitter surely has had FISA requests, too, though they have less data value.  And they've got to deal with that as well. But but, you know, hats off to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they well, but what if they not done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The theory is is true, though. So it doesn't matter.  It is true, which sounds it sounds like it could be they don't need consent from these companies.  They could have tapped Twitter's outgoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a little bit. Then, Gina, then why would there be any FISA warrant requests?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you why. And this is the whole point of this. And this why you once you know who then you know what you go for.  You know, the other way around. You collect everything.  Once you're in an investigation, you go back and you say, oh, yeah, interesting.  There's a bunch of direct messages going on between this guy in Egypt and this guy in Syria.  Then you go to you. You know where it came from because you tapped it at the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could say, hey, Twitter, very limited request, FISA request.  And the company has no choice but to say, OK, that's not over. I got to give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter, we know these conversations happen on this date at this time. Who was that?  Twitter says, here you go. I can't stop you. I can't stop you.  None of these companies are saying they do not comply with federal requests. Of course they do.  They'd be in jail if they didn't. Yep. Right.  So this is the beauty of Steve's theory. And it may be a castle made of air. I don't know, because no one knows.  But the beauty of this theory is all the federal government has to do is go to the tier one service providers,  which includes names like Verizon and AT&T, where we heard those names before,  and say to them, I want to plug in to where Google, Twitter, Facebook goes onto the Internet.  I want to stop that date off. Stop there for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because what authority do they need to do that? Because that is snooping on us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and this is what Steve says. Is that a FISA warrant? No. Well, this is what Steve said. This is public Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it may not be illegal to gather this data. So anybody can do that? It's public Internet. Anybody can just listen to the lie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a very good question. I don't know. I think we need to ask our legal friends about this.  But let's get Ed Snowden on the show. Yeah. Hey, Ed. I know you're in Hong Kong for a while.  It does sound like he has a whole lot to do. But we know already that neither AT&T nor Verizon had any scruples at all about handing everything over.  Right. These backbone companies, nobody's going to the backbone companies and saying, hey, level three, what are you telling the feds?  Nobody's asked them. That is the story now. Nobody knows to ask them. That's who you need to ask.  And they may say instead of a blanket denial, we're not allowed to speak, which is the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really true. That's the story that should be done. And that's what Google Facebook would have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. If they had been complying, they couldn't talk, but they would have said, we are legally not required to lie.  They're required not to reveal anything. OK, they can't be required to lie. Right. Right. So they can say we can't discuss this. Exactly.  And then they didn't. OK. So all right. So we got to find the person who says I can't discuss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And guess what? The telcos have been indemnified by the federal government for exactly this kind of data revolution.  I wonder why? Why would the federal government make the step of indemnifying the telcos?  If they weren't doing this, I think it all fits together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blah. That's my very intelligent analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my. What do Italians say instead of don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we say, oh, but that's not Italian way to say that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I say Maria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  Holy cow. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's exactly the reaction. Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. There you go. There you go.  Oh, my God. No, no, I'm sorry.  Those were very, very foul vulgar vulgarities in Italian.  So I apologize. Anybody speaks Italian.  I was taught to swear in Italian by Italian chess master.  I used to I used to play chess and he would be the worst vulgarities ever.  So if you speak Italian, I apologize.  Madone. Madone.  I love Italian. I can't wait to go to Italy.  Our show today brought to you by 99 Designs.  We use them to do those beautiful shirts.

It's time for the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really thin changelog this week.  The boy, no kidding.  Yeah, we're post Google I.O. We're mid prism.  But a couple of new things. First, Google has released the stock Android keyboard  for Android 4.0 and above in the Play Store.  So anybody who's got an Android device running 4.0 and above  and doesn't want to use the carrier supplied keyboard, go over to Play Store,  search for Google keyboard, and you can see if it's compatible with your device and download it.  And of course, the keyboard has gesture typing and voice typing and next word suggestions  and dictionaries for 26 languages and works across your devices, tablets and phones.  Really nice. So this Google keyboard joins a list of apps which Google continues to sort of decouple  from Android and offer in the Play Store.  Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Hangouts, YouTube, Google search, voice search, sound search, maps, Earth.  I mean, they're really Google plus.  We had the Google Play services kind of get decoupled so that it can issue updates.  The reason why they're doing this is so that they can issue updates to these core Google apps.  Otherwise, they're in the wrong.  Right. Right. Unless they don't want to get hung up in the whole operating system push out.  Right. So this is this is a nice way to do it.  There's still a few apps that they could decouple. They haven't done.  Which ones? Camera, yeah.  Camera, Gallery, the launcher, people.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Launcher would be cool because we all, you know, I think we all use third party launchers these days.  A Google vanilla launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be kind of kind of fun. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much of that stuff? Let me ask a question then.  How much of that kind of separate release would make it OK for you to get a Samsung or HTC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got to tell you, having Nova launcher available made me happy with Samsung.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have used it because they Samsung puts the apps button in the wrong spot.  And there's this weird stuff. So having a custom launcher and Nova launcher is about as close to Fort Tutu's launcher as you can get.  So I think third party launchers are like third party keyboards, a very important part of Android.  Another reason to choose Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can make any really any phone your own.  To answer your question, Jeff, you just you have to have the Play Store on your phone, right?  So it has to be a Google approved device and that it has the Play Store.  But then, yeah, I mean, you really can take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm really saying is I don't want to buy an HTC or a Samsung phone because I don't want all the cruft.  Because you would say, Gina. Right.  But if I can if I can add if I rather than taking all that off and putting the stock Android on there, if I can add enough stock Android stuff on top of Samsung or HTC, does that change my attitude about buying more of their phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem is there's just there's some stuff that you just can't uninstall.  And there are some things that get disabled.  So like tethering, for example, that's one reason why I might not get a contract.  I like to tether, right?  And that's kind of that's enabled in vanilla, pure vanilla Android.  But that's disabled unless you, you know, unless you pay for it or whatever.  And in other other carrier supply versions of Android.  And sometimes there are apps that you just can't they disable uninstalling.  So you're still so you kind of like you can put the core Google experience apps on top of what comes with it.  But then the attraction of vanilla Android for me is none of the crufty you can uninstall and then also just direct updates from Google.  I never want there to be a version of Android that comes out that I either have to wait for or I have to root and run for necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you know, when you get the if you got a sense based HTC one, Facebook can't be uninstalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook cannot be uninstalled.  You can disable it. You can't uninstall it.  So that's an example. So I mean, it's one of those things.  It's like, OK, fine, icons in the app drawer.  Like, OK, you know, does that is that going to bother you enough?  I mean, maybe I'm on maybe I'm super anal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, if you unlike the iPhone, if you don't like the candy cane color scheme, you can get any color scheme, any theme, any launcher.  These are so highly customizable.  That's true.  That's I think that's a really strong argument for it.  For instance, I agree.  I don't like it that 422 requires this Google bar at the top on this on this.  I can turn it off in the launcher.  So, you know, Nova launcher says, do you want it or not?  And so I, you know, I leave it on, but you don't have to if you don't if you didn't want that space used.  So in some ways, I think having a launcher on top of 422 vanilla is probably a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually a really good point about that Google bar.  I'd never tried to remove it, but you're right.  You can't waste space.  I mean, I actually use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but yeah, well, you know what I do?  I do use it because it's the now button.  So what you could do instead is have a now button.  And then I made swipe up be the voice search.  So that's a very easy gesture I can do with my thumb.  I can do any time.  It doesn't require exactly double tapping or finding this little tiny microphone icon.  Just do that.  It's very easy to do.  So that's something that the Nova launcher lets you do.  And I think that it's things like that.  Boy, that's to me.  There's just a no brainer for Android.  I really I just I like to be able to do stuff like that.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  I wonder whether or not I was seven was going to have some sort of home screen customization  that was that went beyond being able to add as many icons as you want to a folder, which everyone clapped at.  And I was like, oh, you poor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on. That's so sad.  That's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had I had a serious moment of Android superiority.  I will I will admit to that.  I was like, oh, that's too bad.  But yeah, I mean, you know, with the parallax effect is cool.  But still, I really widgets are huge or huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's two live icons.  There's now the clock icon shows the actual time and the calendar icon, which has always showed the day continues to show the day.  The weather icon, which should show the weather.  Apple made a big deal about doesn't show the weather.  It doesn't actually come on.  I have to open weather to see what the weather is.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, all you have to do is come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next time you go on like this, you need a segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on.  All right.  So this is so so the second 50 percent of the change this week.  Very, very, very minor change to Google Image Search.  Now, when you do an image search for something.  So the example on Google Google operating system here is if you search for Nexus seven, there's a related search bar across the top.  And actually, the related search bar will suggest other searches, but will show you thumbnails on what you'll get in those searches as well.  So you're really kind of doing multiple searches at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a story in the rundown about how Google did the image search that there was a University of Toronto company that developed a whole bunch of fancy, fancy, fancy technology.  And Google bought them to get that.  Oh, yeah. This is the on the research blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How they're doing the semantic search on your last the other week when we were doing, you know, search my photos for flowers or search my photos for food.  Right. The image recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  DNN research exactly spun out of UT project from Professor Jeffrey Hinton.  That's kind of cool. That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I so I just did an image search for Leo Leporte and I get young I get young photos.  I get twenty thirteen photos. What? Yeah. Yeah. So you wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Now I got to do that. That's cool. I haven't noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Again, again, every week episodes evolves into us Googling ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's really the whole point of Google.  But by the way, I got to point out young. I know that one on the left. Is that even me? Who is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that looks like it looks like the guy was on the young Leo Leporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can tell you that right now.  That's great. And oh, I'm glad they have an entry called sexting. That's wonderful.  Family wife studio. This is interesting.  So this is that is this is from a University of Toronto group. That's very interesting.  And then it just gives you the pool of stuff.  Cool. Yep. With other people on it. But I guess all related to me.  I don't know who that guy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let us let us move on. That's all I got for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is a Google change log. Play the drums.  The Google change log.  Did you see the glass tear down? That was kind of cool.  Did it make you sad, Gina, to see it all taken apart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so. I have been sort of treating it with kid gloves. I have to.  I seeing it kind of torn apart was a little bit like I always react to tear downs that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is pretty simple. So, yeah, a couple of circuit boards, a battery,  a little transducer for the ear. Cool. And this is from Katwig.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I honestly have not been using glass as much as really as much as I should be.  I should really be trying to I need to give it kind of the serious effort of integrating it to my life.  I haven't quite quite gotten there yet. I put up a Google Plus post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said, hey, hey, Google, unless you want Robert Scoble to be head for the official spokesman for class,  would you get it out to the rest of us?  And then I said, no offense, Robert, but I'd step over my grandmother to get it.  And of course, the the the comment exchange was taken over by people going after Robert and Robert answering back.  It's hilarious. You can't even the notion of publicness and everything else.  It's kind of great. He's a lightning rod. Oh, he's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a lightning rod. But if I had class, folks are starting to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get them right, Jeff. I don't think it's long for you. Is it OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm hearing is people who got it got their confirmation on Google Plus. OK.  But those of us who got confirmation on Twitter, I still have this fear that it was actually a fake account.  It's actually a fake account on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're writing on Twitter. I think it was a verified account.  Wasn't it a verified account? I think you're going to be OK.  It's funny that they would make a tweeters wait longer, though, than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it makes sense. I can't play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense because Google Plus is going to build is built into glass.  Sharon and Google Plus is built into glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but let me ask you now, Jeff, in some ways, I think the delay might have helped you.  Do you still want to spend fifteen hundred dollars on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't. It's a good question because because it's not unlike phone questions.  I would rather get probably what they learn from this and get the consumer device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you're getting a very limited device for fifteen hundred bucks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But given what I do here and what I do in my day job, I probably should get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If your day job would pay for it, I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm going to try to make it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Jason has to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Job paid for it. Google Glass Explorers getting notifications from UPS.  Have you got a notification? Maybe it's just going to arrive one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't because you got to go through the whole McGill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. They say they say they're just getting these strange notifications.  Order processed ready for UPS. Shipped to them by Google X.  They didn't pick a color yet. Maybe the maybe there's an invitation in the UPS.  That's probably what it is. Yeah.  Because they're not going to just pop. They don't have my they don't have my home address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I guess they do. They have everything.  They just went and called the NSA and said, what's Jarvis's home address?  No problem. We got it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, somebody in this I'd be much more interested.  I pay I pay more for this has put a Google Glass capabilities into contact lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that I pay for they put the first effort to get a screen into a contact lens.  So that and they put on a rabbit and so the rabbit wore it for six hours and didn't rub its eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's OK. Thank God they tested it thoroughly.  The cosmetics, however, were driving it nuts. Yeah, it was burning.  They coated a contact lens with a conductor and then place a light emitting diode on it.  I love this idea. I would, you know, if this is 10 years off, I'm happy.  Yeah, I hope it is. Because that's the big problem with glass.  This way you know, we didn't even know you're wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it wouldn't be able to take pictures and send them away, which should be a display.  That's fine. I can have the camera somewhere is put a camera into your eyebrow and then we're OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Google file a patent to let you unlock your phone with not merely face recognition, but faces, winks, smiles, grimaces.  I hope this is out. I hope this is true. Unlock.  I would love that an ocular movement sticking out your tongue, opening your mouth, moving your eyebrows.  Nobody has my face and can do this as a patent file. I looked at. Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's smart. Yeah. So you have to like do the Z with your eyes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, you didn't unlock the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you do to do to do? Google's going to be banned in Pakistan if it doesn't clean up YouTube.  I don't even know whether it's worth talking about. Of course, no, no.  I thought this Google search hits and YouTube views are a key predictor of whether a movie is going to make bucks at the box office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what that's really saying, though, Leo, is buzz. Yeah.  An interest is the key predictor. So it's not as if there is a causation or anything like that.  It just says that people are curious about a movie before it comes out. If it has enough buzz. Yeah. That's a predictor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've seen that before predicting presidential elections, too. Right. I mean, this isn't that much of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it makes a lot of sense. And Twitter has been a key predictor in the same way that the discussion of a movie for two weeks beforehand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the the red line on this graph is box office index. The blue line is non title film related search.  And the gray one is the search for that specific for a specific title.  And boy, they could not be more closely linked. That's that's practically one to one correlation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of movies. Yeah. Yes. Who has seen the internship? Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff has. Have you? Yes, we got a baby. You didn't, Leo. Is it in the theaters?  It is. It opened this past weekend. Well, I'm hearing very good things about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you first. It's OK. You know, I'm too close to Google to be able to sort of because, you know, just been covering it for so many years with you two that I found myself thinking like, well, that's not the head of search.  Like I was like about the casting decisions. And, you know, there were some lines that were sort of cheesy.  Oh, this is in our DNA. That's not in our DNA. I'll be like, oh, that would be a nuclear orientation.  So I was being the sort of annoying, nitpicking geek.  I found it interesting that the I don't think this is a spoiler.  I mean, the moral of the story was basically that human empathy matters as much, if not more, than data and algorithms, which I thought was kind of ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that's true. This is not true. I don't think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not true. And there was a line where they that there was one line where they said diversity is in our DNA, which I also thought meaning diversity of their staff, which I thought was a little bit like that.  True. A little bit like that.  Is that not true?  I don't know. I don't know. Is it?  But overall, it was fine. It was enjoyable there. There were a couple of laughs. I thought, you know, I mean, no one will say.  I thought the first half was pretty excruciatingly boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the last half became charming. All the complaints about, oh, it's a commercial for Google.  What was it supposed to be? You know, a hack on Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very much a commercial for Google. Absolutely. It's an homage to Google.  Clearly, Google cooperated with them. And, you know, there are a couple of cameos.  Page and Brynn were both in it.  You know, it was interesting. I mean, if you think about the Facebook movie, the social network versus the internship, and Anil asked, you know, what are the cultural implications that the Facebook movie was such a different experience, right, than the internship?  You know, one was, I think, feel it kind of very, very critical of Facebook and cast Zuckerberg in this sort of negative light, whereas this was a very sort of lighthearted romp through, you know, this wonderland that is this campus or whatever.  I don't know. It was it was fine. It was fine. I think a lot of competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one of the I saw one of the real life intern wrote about the movie. They had a lot of that going on. Oh, yeah.  And one said it's the experience is not like that. It's not a competition.  But then again, everything at Google is probably a competition to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and interestingly, the final bit of the competition when it came down to it, and this might be a little bit of a spoiler, but I won't I won't say more.  But it was selling advertising, right? Like the thing that the team was going to win, whether it was whether or not they could sell.  Hollywood knows what Google's business is. Yeah.  So which was interesting, which is definitely interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I'll go see it then.  It sounds like I should see it because I am on the show. Yeah.  Did you like it, Jeff?  Expect more from a professional critic than B minus.  OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say that if you didn't do what we do, if you have a very is a perfectly pleasant night, you can take your kids to it.  That's fine. Yeah.  It would be a happily spent hour and a half on cable.  Good. I'll save it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm always saving movies for cable. Yeah.  Oh, you should go see it.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not renounced. The glass was in it. Arthur, the self-driving car was in it.  No, no, the in the chat room, Arthur in the chat room.  You see glass. I didn't see glass.  I think wasn't wasn't Sergey wearing glass.  Now, there was a people have been debating about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think it was like presumed it was.  Oh, I'm not sure it was.  Hmm. Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't at this point, does he go anywhere without glass?  I guess we're so used to seeing him with glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just assumed to be part of his face.  Yes, assumed as part of his face. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, it was not glass was not part of the was not a major part of the plot.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds boring to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, you know, it was cute. It was a stupid comedy.  Sounds dull. Yeah, it's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back with our tip, tool and number of the week.  But first a word from Squarespace.com, the best hosting in the world tied to a remarkable content management system.

Start your site preserving all the SEO, all the images, all the links, even all the comments.  And see what your site would look like on a Squarespace server.  Then tell all your friends and try to bring the server down.  You won't be able to.  One of the nice things about Squarespace is all of their designs are mobile ready.  So you don't have a junky looking mobile site like I do.  I got to move to Squarespace. I say this every time.  You make one of their designs and it looks great on a 27 inch monitor, on an iPad, on an iPhone.  It's just gorgeous.  They call it mobile responsive design. It's the latest, greatest stuff.

Gina Trapani has our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just revised our tip or my tip because Enzo here in the chat room just let me know something Jeff is going to be very happy about.  It looks like Google just released a new app for Android for Google Cloud Print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're doing just what you said they were going to do.  Yeah, more stuff. More.  Actually, there's never they had there was a third party cloud print.  I have it on here. You can show it.  I've already installed it. It wasted no time.  I've already installed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just got released like in the past hour.  So you can print from any compatible Android device to any Google Cloud Print connected computer.  Share a picture or document from apps like Gallery directly to Cloud Print and you can track the status of your of your print job.  So I haven't had a chance to install this yet.  I actually don't have a cloud print printer set up yet.  Although Jeff has really sold me on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use my Mac at home, which pretty much now is nothing but a cloud print server.  And print through it over Wi-Fi to my printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I can print. I'm going to print an image right now to my Epson Workforce Pro at home, which is a cloud print printer on my network.  And you have all the you know, the print dialog is all here.  I'm going to print one copy and I'm going to say go.  And now this is sending it to my printer at home.  I also have a cloud print printer here at the office.  I could send it to it also shows you all the print jobs you've done this one.  These two are queued. This is queued. These are printed already.  I mean, this is great. This is really.  Yeah, I mean, I'm printing from an Android phone, but from a pixel or a Chromebook.  Also a great choice. I do it from all my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really nice to be able to cloud print and it would be great in the future is if you're visiting an office or something on the whiteboard.  It has the Wi-Fi password. It should then have the cloud print printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you have this app, though, it just tells you what your printers are.  It's all set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying that when you want to print at a hotel or someone.  Oh, I see what you're saying. They should give you that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  I just sent my mom a printer because she needs a new a new photo printer.  And I make sure it was cloud print capable because I'm going to set it up so that I can print stuff for her.  So scare her to death.  But think about it. If I want to send her a recipe, I could email it to her.  But it would be a lot easier if I just say, oh, I'm going to print it out for you.  And in Rhode Island is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should set up a photo printer at my mom's. Exactly.  The baby. Yeah. Exactly.  Except for the whole part where you're putting ink on paper, which is kind of ancient technology.  I just don't print that much. That's why I've never gone through the trouble of setting up cloud print because I print so infrequently.  But something like that, like sending my mom pictures of the baby, like that would be or just messages.  My mom just doesn't like check or email that. That's a really good.  The problem is you just you have to have a computer kind of connected to a printer.  Right. Oh, you know, you can get a cloud printer. Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You buy a cloud. So I only buy Wi-Fi printers now.  You're crazy to buy a printer that has to be connected.  Just get every printer that has Wi-Fi. Never buy another HP. Refuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll never be able to set them up. Epson. Epson. Epson. Love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The art is in his Wi-Fi. The workforce. If you need a bigger multifunction.  I have a workforce at home and here.  And it's great. I buy. I'm definitely. And it's on the Wi-Fi network. It's not connected to anything.  There's no wires. Doesn't have to have a computer on or anything. It just prints to it.  So it's it's like a fax machine. Yeah. Yeah, that's great.  It's really it's really handy. I'll tell you what the one one of the few things I still print is airplane passes, air boarding passes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I don't need to do that anymore. I'm now using my phone for that.  I don't trust it. They all I don't trust. I actually I agree.  I was that way for a while and print a second. What's the harm of having a boarded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I might use my phone, but it's what's the harm of having a printed boarding pass right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have arrived. I have discovered recently I'm on TSA pre.  It is the greatest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is wonderful. It's just a blow through that whole line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody glares you. They already know about me.  Thank you. And I say for the service here, I say, who says this is a bad thing?  Right. They can guarantee that I'm OK.  I think it's all in the data and I blow right through.  All I do is take a change and out. That's it.  So they don't scan you or anything. You just have to take you walk through the metal detector, the plain old the old fashioned one.  You put everything on the belt. Don't take out the liquids.  Don't take out the computer. Don't do any of that.  Boom, you're through. But then you don't have to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to do the body scan. No, no, you're not a little detector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. That's really wonderful.  Jeff, your number two is that I'm happy about a regression to life before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have so many.  Google made a 52 tera pixel time lapse map of the world covering 29 years.  Wow. A Google funded study says that if we moved a lot of cloud apps, things up to the cloud, we'd save enough energy to power L.A.  For a year. But oh, my God, what a waste of energy that is.  The internship made eighteen point one million in the first weekend, which was fourth place, but about what was expected.  It's the 50th birthday of ASCII.  And finally, the one Leo wanted me to use on this one is that Google interns earn between fifty eight hundred and sixty seven hundred dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't sound like an internship to me. It's not like a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, here's one of the time lapses. This is Dubai.  Watch this. Dubai really went through a quite a credit growth spurt.  It was it was just a lot of sand.  There's the Columbia Glacier. See it melting. Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glacier. This is a powerful statement about how we change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at that. Here's the Amazon.  Yeah, I think this is great.  And it's it's all on the Web.  Obviously, you're not going to download all 52, whatever.  52 tera pixels, tera pixels.  But you can hear you. Let's do Las Vegas. Let's look at Las Vegas.  Oh, yes. So just that little desert area there and then.  Building it right up. Yeah, wow. Yeah.  I thought Dubai was was really interesting.  Let's go. This is the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twenty nine years. Yeah, that sprouts those two.  Which, by the way, they never finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's time dot com slash time lapse.  And you did the number.  So we're we're good. We're done.  I actually was going to do cloud print.  That's why I had it on my machine.  No, don't worry. I got plenty of plenty of plenty of tools.  This is actually one for you, Jean.  If you do get that HTC one, Qualcomm,  which makes the processor in it, the Snapdragon,  makes a product that is free.  And I installed it on my HTC one called the Snapdragon battery guru.  Now, there's some debate over whether battery saving apps are any good  or they're just another like kind of task killer thing.  This does definitely help.  It watches what you do for a few days and then puts to sleep apps  that you don't really need or gives you the choice of how each app should  respond. So you can say, you know, Google Play Music.  I don't want it to update at all ever.  Or I do want it when I need it.  That's the most intelligent choice.  That's the automated choice that it watched you for.  But or all the time, you know, anytime it wants to get on it, turn it on.  And most of most of these apps, you don't need Google Play Music  to update all the time in the background. Come on.  So I have it refresh when you use and that can save considerable battery  life. This is free and it's from Qualcomm.  But you do need to have an Android phone with a Snapdragon in it.  So it won't work on a Galaxy S4.  I don't think actually mine might work on the US Galaxy S4.  Actually, probably would.  You'll know. You'll know which one you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It says incompatible with all my devices, but I may get the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when you get the one, it'll be listed. It'll work. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. It's yeah. It's all nice. Yeah.  Thank you, Gina Trapani, smarterware.org, think up dot com to do text dot com.  That's me. That's her. Thank you.  Android all about it. All about it.  Every Tuesday right here. Thanks.  All about Android. Yep. Tuesday nights. Tuesday nights.  What is that? Five at five. Yep. Five p.m. Pacific.  If you're into Android, that's really a good show to watch.  And I apologize for all this Android talk.  So we'll save it for the other show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's great. I get to I get both perspectives.  It helps me prep. It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the more I use the iPhone, the more I like Android.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis blogs at buzzmachine.com.  He's also a professor of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I may plug these days, publicness is more relevant than ever, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Do you talk about that issue of, you know, being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Government transparency. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And government being the threat to us.  You will like our guest on today's triangulation.  Oh, is that I got to find his name.  I don't have it right to hand.  He did a really remarkable TED talk.  Jason Silva of Brain Games. You know his name?  No, he's all about radical openness.  In fact, he's got a I'll show this Vimeo because it's so good.  He says really.  And many agree. People like Ray Kurzweil that evolution  now is Richard Dawkins not happening in our bodies.  It's happening in our ideas that the the the progress,  the human progress now comes from radical openness with ideas.  The more we share, the more we put our ideas out there and don't hold on to them,  the faster the human race can progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the NSA is just doing us a favor. That's right.  That's all. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Radical openness, our topic.  Jason Silva joins us in just a few minutes on triangulation.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  We do this week in Google 1 p.m. Pacific time.  That's 4 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 2100 UTC on Twitter TV.  Please watch. We'd love it if you do.  But if you can't watch live, you can always get on demand versions  after the fact at Twitter TV slash twig or wherever finer podcasts  are aggregated like dogcatcher on Android.  What is there a podcast app for the pixel?  You can just listen on the Web, I guess, if you're in a pixel.  Yeah. Yeah.  There might be a Chrome plug in off the look.  Never thought about that. Of course, iTunes.  Hey, thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time.
