Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi. So glad to be here. Welcome back, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Host of All About Android.  Yeah.  It's nice to be back. Thank you guys for filling in for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina is the one who did the yeoman's effort. I finked out last week.  So it was all you finked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I finked.  Jeff Finky Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody on Twitter suggested, Leo, that neither you nor I was welcome back because Gina did such a wonderful job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's the sad fact of the matter is that Gina's too damn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was nervous, you guys. I'm really happy you're both here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was told to get a shrink by this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got into a very big battle going was going on while I was gone between Jeff and some some listener.  And I wanted to just say, just ignore that, Jeff. I get that every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was all that was amazing. Yeah. That was what the guy spent a lot of time writing that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, basically there's an inverse proportion to the intelligence of the email and the length of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found but or to the to the life existing outside the strange world anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for engaged listeners.  Well, we're glad they're engaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's a you see, this is why Gina is so good.  She she found the silver lining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I answered back and it was all about the I'm going to do it again.  See, you shouldn't answer because it doesn't.  That's the problem because then he said, well, you only answer one line.  Now that's it. I've lost you as a fan. I'm gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had that the other day.  I had this. It's just weird.  It's just weird. People.  I think that what we what here's what I would suggest.  And I'm not going to call this guy out by any means.  In fact, we appreciate people's feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And he cares about the show.  Yeah, he just cares about my Google reader a little too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The thing I've noticed about the Internet in general is we assume that everybody out there is like us.  God help the world.  Well, we just you just assume, hey, I'm having a conversation with somebody there.  They're rational, normal people.  But, you know, the world is full of a broad variety of types and not everybody is normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody has their buttons, you know, has a button.  And sometimes you say something kind of a toss off joke or comment or whatever, and it just presses somebody's button.  It just hits on something that's sensitive for them at the moment or for whatever reason.  And and then, yeah, then things get weird. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe he was having a bad day. You know, sometimes you have a bad day.  His dog died. His wife left him.  Train ran over his car, whatever.  And he decided to take it out on you.  So I just ignored those. Yeah. Yeah.  But, you know, it's the same thing.  And when you're in a chat room or a forum or whatever, you just assume everybody's normal and they're not.  They're loony tunes out there. They're crazy.  No, I'm just being I'm being silly. Hello, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stranger danger. Stranger danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine dot com.  He's also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  I met somebody on the cruise, a young woman who is a writer.  She's actually writing for like the New Yorker and the nation.  And I and I mentioned you, Jeff. And I said, you know, it's good to see somebody succeeding in journalism.  This is a difficult profession these days.  But what she's what's been interesting is she's writing a lot for online now.  Yeah, I guess that's what you do. That's exactly what you do.  Of course, there's not as much money in online, but we're going to fix that.  All right. What do you want to talk about? Did anything happen while I was gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's a new Chromebook, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're cool, too. These new they are crown bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really look nice. They look like they're well engineered.  The best thing about them. Charge with USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so interesting. Isn't that cool?  Isn't that cool? Yeah. So this is from HP.  We kind of talked is this the one we talked about? But Google helped them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a blessing here. The only problem is it has the same tech specs essentially as the old Samsung one,  which, though nice, was just too slow to handle to maintain its low end.  It's low end. So it's not what do you expect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It charges with a USB micro USB.  Wow, that is neat. That is so smart.  Now, I probably charge it slowly because there's not a lot of wattage on that sucker.  You know, most laptops have 40, 50, 100 watt power supplies.  The most you can get out of USB is around 10 watts.  And that directly impacts charge time. So I'm not sure what they're doing there on that one.  But we'll see. We'll get one. We'll review it. I like the colors. Google colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I generally think that this whole color thing is such a gimmick and I never, you know, whatever.  I never think much make much of colors, but I really like that the way they did the colors on these, their accents versus, you know, the whole thing.  And those those bands, those colored bands you're seeing, that's actually the bottom of the machine.  So those are like the rubber grips. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're kind of two tone and it could be yellow and white or green and white or red and white, whatever, whatever you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or if you're really boring by black. Yeah. Right. Or just plain black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's got the little rainbow across the top. I love that. Like the pixel. Like the pixel.  Yeah. Now, I wonder if that lights up the same way as the pixel. I think you have to pay $1,200 for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Did you read the article in Business Insider about the birth of the pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of interesting. Cesar Sengupta. Chromebooks. Chromebooks. Chromebooks in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, he's your son Gupta. He he said the Chromebook thing started as a 20 percent project for him.  He at his day job was running Google toolbar and Google desktop.  But he he wanted to do a little bit of hardware.  He was actually saying that the issue for him was these crappy slow boot biases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amen. It was still checking. I love that it was still checking for floppy drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. He said his two thousand nine computers take five to six minutes to boot.  And and partly because, yeah, it's going, is there a floppy?  So when he got the fast BIOS to boot in eight or nine seconds, it was like, wow.  Yeah. Yeah. So they asked Business Insider, Julie Bort doing this interview.  Was there a moment when Larry or Sergey saw that and said, let's build PCs?  And Cesar said something I thought was kind of interesting. Google doesn't really function with a single executive.  It's a very bottoms up culture. The way it works, people start moving to the project.  Once people saw our initial demo, we had engineers going around saying, hey, can we help you?  The projects at Google typically get staffed initially like this.  At some point you get to this critical mass and it gets much easier to get resources.  It's a very interesting way of doing things. You get you have to get the buy in of your peers before you even can talk to Larry or Sergey about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, although it suffers the risk that you have a lot of products or built that are built for people who work at Google.  Yes, right. Right. Like, which is the pixel. Extremely smart, privileged, over educated, smart engineer types.  You know what I mean? Which is not a bad thing, but there's an inherent kind of there's an inherent bias there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, I know if a project successful when I see other Googlers using it, he says this year is one of those years where suddenly Googlers are starting to carry around Chromebooks.  And of course, that's the pixel. I'm sure he says the pixel is something that's used by a very large number of Googlers.  So he knows we've succeeded. Well, that's not the only metric in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not. But selfishly, that gives me hope that they'll do a new version. Right. Using the Haswell chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dogfooding it. Yeah, I have to say, and I might this might be a little bit of a retrenching on my part, a little bit of apologizing.  Not not in general about the pixel. I still think that's really too expensive.  But I do think that Chromebooks right now, schools are adopting Chromebooks faster. Schools are going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched the Chromebook group on Google Plus, and it's just amazing to see what the educators are doing with them and just the numbers involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hundreds there by that's I think that's good. I think it is, in fact, a perfect school computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, much better. We talked on the show some time ago in L.A. got iPads.  I had 30 million dollars worth of iPads. There was a story about what a disaster it is, which we predict the kids hacked it within days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all the security software they build in there to keep kids from doing anything good with their iPads.  First thing the kids go is, no, that's not going to go. That's not going to fly.  They hacked it immediately. Of course. But that's the beauty of a Chromebook.  You get me there. It's a I guess you could put I mean, if you're really good, you could put Linux on it, make it a full full service computer.  But really, no, it's a browser. Yeah. Yeah.  Now, Google's going the other way. We mentioned before I left that Chrome apps on Windows.  But apparently they're built. They're starting to build Chrome OS right into Windows 8.  This I get my head around. I don't understand how they're doing this without my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, I was so hoping you just explain it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I I was trying to get my head around what's going on here.  This is a verge story. And they're saying that Chrome traditionally runs on the desktop in Windows 8.  But you can so this is giving developers the ability to set Chrome to launch within Windows 8 start screen in a special a special Metro style mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is something Microsoft allowed and encouraged kind of remember ActiveX.  The idea that you could have Internet internet based apps.  Yeah. So this is something Microsoft actually created.  It's a Windows 8 special mode for browsers.  It lets browsers basically be part of the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is kind of incredible on so many different levels.  I mean, I mean, when you think about I mean, I think it's great that that that Windows allowed this and that Microsoft is encouraging this.  I'm still trying to understand why I guess a developer.  So OK, so you're saying you can start Chrome when Windows starts right so that so that users can then click on an icon a web app icon in the start menu to launch it as if it's a native app as if it's a native app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you could in other words, you can assume that Chrome services are available right now.  You know, they don't have to you don't have to do anything.  So in addition to the Windows API API and all the things you could do in Windows, you could assume a certain number of Chrome services are also available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if that turned on for users automatically or a system.  Well, they have to install.  They'd have to install some Chrome or Chrome layer or whatever.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it may be that if they install one of these Metro Chrome apps that it says, you know, it brings in a DLL called Chrome.  I don't know exactly how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do you have an but then you have web apps within the web app within the micro within the Chrome app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they look. No, you don't see Chrome running.  That's what's so weird. Yeah, you don't see Chrome running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. They can just be full.  They appear to be windows that are just like native app windows.  I feel like, you know, there's so many companies have just tried this over and over again.  I mean, you have like Mac OS 10 with those widgets, which are web based.  And we've seen widgets on like the Vista and Windows 7 desktops.  We've seen Adobe Air like that.  Like that, you know, we've seen so many sort of runtimes that let developers make these, you know, web, you know, these widgets or application native native like applications with web technologies.  I just over and over we see them, you know, happen and they never really have caught on so far.  I think Tweet Tech was the only like Air app, Adobe Air app that I used a lot.  And actually now it's a Chrome app. I use the Chrome app. Right.  Right. That's the Chrome app. Right.  Otherwise, they've always just been more of a novelty than something that users have really dug into.  Well, at least that's my impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does feel like a Trojan horse a little bit, but Microsoft's not stupid.  They know what they're doing. They know what Google's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Chrome's a big browser. I mean, you know, if if if if if you're just too limited and can't use a browser you like and a product that at some level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure this kind of capabilities there for Internet Explorer. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's amazing, though, given the market share that Internet Explorer had, you know, back in the day that this is that this is happening right now.  I saw this on PBS Frontline did like a Steve Jobs thing this week because, you know, it's the anniversary of his death.  And I think it was Mossberg.  Mossberg was saying they had he had they had interviewed him and he was saying that he really liked both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates very much as people.  They were both kind of difficult to work for.  Steve was more fun to be around.  You know, Gates was a lot more technical.  The one the one comparison he made between the two companies is that like Microsoft was always improving things incrementally.  They're always making incremental changes, whereas Apple was always taking a very long view and trying to reach like very big what seemed to be almost impossible goals.  And that that's what he really liked about Steve and Apple kind of more than than Microsoft.  And and so, you know, it's interesting.  He said, you know, this is why Microsoft lost their foothold.  They completely missed the Internet basically because they were so busy sort of concentrating on office shipping office, right, which was their big revenue maker.  And so so it's interesting to see Microsoft coming around to this place where they're bundling Chrome into the metro because this is the browser.  There was another piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a little piece, I think, in the Times this week about the guy who's in charge of Microsoft Cloud.  And we mean there were the cloud show and how that's a big cultural change for them is not to push the OS, but to push the idea of of working on the cloud.  And that's hard for Microsoft to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not like Apple's not going to come up against hard times to me.  What's hard is to be a successful tech company and then reinvent yourself every five years, as is required these days.  Indeed.  It was required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was required for Apple to come back from the dead.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know.  I don't.  Did you guys read the New York Times magazine on Sunday, the article about Steve Jobs and the iPhone?  Wow.  You've got to read this.  We talked about it on Mac Break Weekly yesterday.  They it's it's from a book that Fred Vogelstein, who's at Wired magazine, is writing right now about Apple.  It's an excerpt from a book and and he let's see the book name.  I'm going to give Fred full credit on this.  The book name is Dogfight, How Apple and Google Went to War and Started a Revolution.  But part of it is about the iPhone.  He interviews Andy Grignan, who was a an engineer, who was one of the chief designers of the radios in the first iPhone.  And he talks about what a hairball it was and how difficult it was to do.  And in fact, they talk a lot about the the unveiling of the iPhone.  The first time is 2007 of the first iPhone and how it didn't work.  There was a magic path that Jobs would have to follow because Jobs wanted to show the browser, show an email and make a couple of phone calls.  And the phone would crash if you tried to do that.  So there was a magic path that Jobs had to follow to the letter or it would crash.  And time and time again in rehearsals, it crashed, it crashed, it crashed.  And Jobs get more and more angry.  He's looking at people and says, you are effing up my company.  But it's a it's a very dramatic story.  And in fact, it's very funny because Grignan says, I brought a bottle of scotch to this demo because we did.  We had no idea if this was going to fly.  And every time a part of the demo worked, the guy who was responsible for that took a shot.  I mean, we're all in the audience here. We didn't see this is all going on in the fifth row.  And he said, by the end of the demo, it was the best demo I'd ever seen in my life.  And in fact, I think everybody agrees.  This was Steve Jobs at his finest, this initial iPhone announcement.  And he said, we were all wasted.  He said the rest of the day was completely written off.  But but the meth.  And the reason I bring this up is the message I got from this incredible piece, which I highly recommend,  is that without some guy like Steve Jobs, just kicking ass, cracking the whip, inspiring people,  because you can't just do that.  And because people go, well, screw you, Steve, I'm out of here.  But inspiring people really saying, you've got to give me everything.  You're going to you're going to lose your family.  You're going to lose your life.  I'm going to have you for the next five years.  You know, 24 7, but we're going to change the world.  And people did it.  Yeah.  And without a guy like that behind it, it's pretty hard for a tech company to survive.  And I think it's even harder for a second act.  I mean, Steve had several acts.  That's also the top down view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you look, if you go back to what you read about about the Chromebook, there is a Google so goddamn big.  Right.  There is some level of bottom up.  There is some level of people creating Chromebooks or Google News or whatever these things are that can still bubble up there.  I'm sure it's hard and I'm sure it's gotten too big and all that's probably true.  But there are still inventions from within that aren't controlled just for one person at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I completely agree.  And I think this is I think this is intentional on Larry's part.  I think Larry Page is knows this.  Everybody knows this is the innovators dilemma, knows the challenge that as you get successful and you get big,  how hard it is to stay nimble.  And I'm sure Larry saw this as a systems problem and said, how can we design a company of 100,000 employees that is innovative as and as exciting as a startup?  And what he's done, it seems to me, is create a lot of many startups within the company.  There's this it's kind of like this headless company.  And if you're in charge of a product, it's almost like it's your own company, which now Microsoft did this.  And failed.  Google has the problem of you get announcements that are, you know, the time frames conflict.  And, you know, it's like different.  We've talked about this before.  Different companies.  It's like different companies within the same company.  Apple had this unitary vision where no, no, it's all top down.  Microsoft tried to do this thing where you have a bunch of dictators, but each of them is because of the stack ranking system.  This is Dvorak's theory.  And I think he's probably right.  Each of them is fighting for their life.  It's like Survivor.  So they're killing each other.  They're shooting at each other.  You know, saying Office succeeds only if, you know, the iPad apps fail, et cetera, et cetera.  And so nobody can succeed.  All of this is an attempt to solve the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and for Apple that's used to that structure, what is Johnny Ive it or not?  I just I just put something in the chat on the rundown.  Have you seen the Johnny Ive Leica?  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Yeah, so it's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  One's going to be made.  Right.  And so I don't you know, it's like Senator.  I'm you're no senator moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was the famous debate line.  I know.  I know.  I knew Jack Kennedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you are no Jack Kennedy.  Yeah.  Who was that?  God, we're too old.  Yeah, we are.  It was in a it was in a presidential debate or actually was a vice presidential debate.  Yes.  And anyway, it doesn't matter now.  No, it was a Dan Quayle and Lloyd Benson.  How about you cheated, didn't you?  Yeah, I had a little help.  Thank you, Chad.  Well, Lloyd Benson saying I knew Jack Kennedy.  I work with Jack Kennedy and you, sir, are no Jack Kennedy.  And he was right.  Jack Kennedy could smell tomato, smell tomato.  So Johnny Ive has designed this beautiful Leica camera.  There's only going to be one.  It's going to be auctioned by Sotheby's on November 23rd to benefit Project Red, Product  Red, Bono's charity to fight AIDS in Africa.  They expect it to go off at half a million to three quarters of a million dollars for  this one camera.  Jesus.  It is beautiful.  It is beautiful.  So Johnny is brilliant.  There's no question Johnny's brilliant.  I don't know.  I doubt Johnny is a whip cracker.  Can he inspire maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does he have the business genius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Tim Cook does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Cook does.  Cook has the business genius, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is, and I keep coming back to this, it's the innovator's dilemma.  It's very hard to be a successful tech company and continue on.  Microsoft couldn't do it.  IBM couldn't do it.  It's going to happen to Apple and Google at some point.  So far, Google has.  But Google's what?  13 years old.  They've had their birthday, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not an old company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a search company.  It was an ad company.  It's now a mobile company.  So far, it's had three lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the Larry Page strategy of letting a million flowers bloom is the right way to  do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Well, he doesn't want a million.  He lets a million bloom and then he stomps on 900,000 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, let's talk about this.  Actually, I want to take a break.  I want to talk about Chromecast because there's some stomping going on.  Yeah.  It's stomping time.  And we're also going to get our change log because I've been gone a long time.  I don't know what.  You have to tell me everything that Google's done in the last three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  We'll play back the last three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knowing Google, they've done a million things.  We got a brand new sponsor I want to talk about.  Full Sail University.  Do you know Full Sail?  I think you do, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  It's a competitor, but a worthy competitor.  It's a for-profit university that does a lot of really good practical stuff like in my field of journalism and media and offers degrees.  And as someone put out in the chat room before the show, JD Harmeier of the Howard Stern Show is a proud graduate of Full Sail.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What that's worth.  So they have a campus.  I think it's a Florida campus, but they also have an online campus.  You can get master's degrees.  You can get bachelor's degrees.  They have an online internet marketing master's degree program.  So if you want to keep pace with marketing technologies, I mean, like the latest stuff like social media, search engine optimization, web metrics, stuff that frankly a conventional university isn't going to be up on.  Full Sail can teach you.  Analyzing online consumer behavior.  You will be working on real projects with real clients to gain experience, to generate results and learn from people, instructors who really are in the industry and have the real experience.  And I love this.  This really is kind of the new kind of university, frankly.  Full Sail's online and campus degree programs are centered on real world education, experience with industry, technology and workflow.  You can earn your master's degree in a year, 12 months.  They also have something called Project Launchbox.  Students receive a MacBook Pro preloaded with Apple's creative software tools, the whole thing, as well as degree specific sets of pro level applications.  They have classes in all, in video production, audio production.  They've Grammy Award winners, Emmy Award winners.  They've got an MFA in film production, a mobile gaming master's program.  How about that?  If you, I think if you wanted to say, what's the thing I could do that would guarantee me the best shot at making a million bucks in technology, learn how to do mobile gaming.  That would be the way to do it.  So here's the deal.  I want you to visit fullsail.edu slash twig.  We've got a special landing page.  I really wanted you to know about Full Sail.  I think it's a very interesting program.  I know a number of people have gone.  In fact, I've talked to Lisa.  Lisa really wants to go and get her advanced degree.  And I said, look, we'll pay for it.  Twitter will pay for you, our CEO.  And I think this is a great way to have somebody who's still working, who's still part of the company, but enhance their skills to bring to the company.  Real world experience in entertainment, media, and technology, full sail, F-U-L-L-S-A-I-L, like a boat.  Although they have an airplane as a logo, so I don't know what that means.  Full Sail University, fullsail.edu slash T-W-I-G.  Brand new sponsor.  I want to welcome them and really encourage you just go and check it out.  You know, this is one way to keep education relevant.  It really is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think education needs for profit competitors.  We in education are big, fat, sassy, lazy, and stuck in our old ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, well, if it doesn't work, if they don't make it, they're out of business, right?  They've got to perform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got to give students what they need to get jobs in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's Lisa want to study?  Well, she's already got a business degree.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  But I think when you, I think this is really true that, and I know most companies do this.  When you have somebody who's a really valuable part of the company,  having them get additional education during, you know, while they're working is phenomenal.  If she's willing to take the time in her downtime to do that.  If only more companies would.  We should pay for that.  You know, I think that only benefits us.  Full Sail, they even have Academy Awards.  35 graduates worked on seven different Oscar-winning films from Full Sail.  That is pretty impressive.  All right, moving on.  Let's do it.  Let's play the drums.  Hey, wait a minute before we do, we should give a plug.  The guy who did the change log frame has is up to something new, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's Jesse Wiener is he worked on a YouTube video and he did the he did the score for it.  And so if you head on over to bit.ly, bit.ly slash boats 2013,  you can see the video that he worked on or bit.ly slash sail song.  Let me skip the ad here.  Hold on. Yeah.  Slash sail on songs.  So this is like cars and planes.  Yeah. But with boats.  So basically and there's some really there's some really famous YouTubers in there.  And what's going on is there's a pitch for the new movie, which is boats.  And that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he did the music.  Yeah.  Nice job, Jesse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're boats that talk near adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is she a famous YouTuber?  Now we don't have a story yet.  I bet you that fat guy's not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look like me.  That's Kev Jumbo over there.  Who's who will start causing problems in just a bit.  But yeah, yeah.  So he worked on that.  So it's not like boats 2013.  Check it out.  Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bit.ly slash boats 2013.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, another Jesse Wiener production.  The Google change log.  Want to be in the water.  Turn me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina Trapani will now catch me up on everything that's happened since I've been gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, at least everything that's happened since last week.  All right.  Google search results just in time for premiere season.  So the Google search results now tell you when a TV show is airing.  So if you do a Google search for, say, the Good Wife TV show, which I highly recommend.  Great show.  Just did a great episode about NSA surveillance.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve was talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was, you know, it's TV.  So there are parts that are fictionalized and a little eye rolly.  But for the most part, for a CBS show on Sunday night, they do a really good job.  A lot of issues that we talk about here on Twig, too.  So so you Google a TV show name like The Good Wife or Modern Family or Agents of Shield.  If it's a show that has a really common term like I'm hooked on parenthood, if you just Google parenthood and you just add TV show to the end of it in the the Knowledge Graph area there on the right side, you'll get all the episodes that are coming up and their air dates and some and some, you know, things about the cast.  And if there's a new episode that's going to come up, remind me.  Yeah, there's a that's the that's so great.  Remind me on Google now.  So Google now remind you about new episodes on your phone or tablet.  This also works for movies, so I can't wait for the next Hunger Games movie to come out.  It's in November.  Counting down the days, you can add just a little reminder to Google now and it'll tell me when one movie's the movie will be out.  So really cool.  Really nice use of the really cool to see that that reminder link there for Google now that links to Android, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  I want to I want to search for Nexus five and have a remind me.  So let's remind me to buy an Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to talk about that.  So so yeah, good stuff there and search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Google now.  Have we said that lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we have. Yeah, Google now is also getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was traveling, I used it all the time.  It would say things like, oh, the time at home is or hey, it's you want to go to the Rialto Bridge.  It's five minutes by boat.  I mean, it was brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's particularly good when you're traveling when you're someplace other than home.  It'll tell you currency conversion and when you're getting the airport.  Really, it's really great.  It even would say things like home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's morning in Turkey and it gets it knows I'm in Turkey.  It says, here's how you say good morning in Turkey on my Google now cards.  Wow. It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's amazing.  Yeah.  You could just get breakfast and be like, speak for me.  Google now say good morning.  Oh, yeah, you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't do it.  Didn't say Turkish out loud, but I could say to Google now, you know, tell tell tell the  conducieri that I'm just a visitor here and it would say it in Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. Very nice.  Very cool.  So what else is good new?  Oh, a little, little minor change that will help sharing Google Docs is now easier for people who use  Google Apps through a domain, which which I do.  You try to share a Google Doc with a client or someone who's who's outside of your domain who  doesn't have an address in your domain.  It'll say, oh, this person's on the outside.  And if they don't have a Google account, they can't share it.  You have to use a link that anybody can see.  Well, now you do not have to have a Google account in order to see.  This is actually big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a big deal.  So you can share a Google Doc with someone who does not have a Google account.  You can send them an email with a link and they can view the link without having to sign into Google to  see the CD doc, which is which is sounds very minor, but it actually is really a big thing, especially  when you're sending docs around to clients or potential customers or whatever.  Google Glass update this week.  Xe 10 new firmware came with a couple of different updates.  The biggest one is transit.  If you're in one of the cities that Google Maps has transit data for Google on Glass, it will show you not  only timetables, but guidance on where to change trains, the distance, the nearest bus stop, overall  estimated time of arrival and other minor changes in Xe 10 for Glass.  You can see links and notifications.  You can open up a site if you get a link in a notification.  You can see profile pictures and a background or a message or comment card.  Google's really pushing, you know, been pretty pretty great about pushing out updates to Glass.  So nice, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How often do you wear yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not very often, not very often, but I have to tell you, transit and directions in an urban area like when I go  back to New York, walking around the streets of New York, Glass, you know, much like now is very helpful  when you're traveling.  Like I feel like Glass in the streets of New York, the streets of San Francisco would be extremely,  extremely helpful.  Not in the subway.  Right now I really, no, right, not in the subway, right, because you're not connected.  Although some subway stations are actually getting connectivity.  Last time I was in New York, I was on a train on the tracks and there was a guy talking on his cell phone.  And I was like, how is this happening?  And it must have been one of those stations where like, I guess there was AT&T service and he was saying to the guy,  I don't know how I have service down here.  So I don't know how they're doing that, that, Jeff, they're just hooking up at uncertain stations or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know there's Wi-Fi in certain stations.  I didn't realize that there was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the cell service mainly along 42nd Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  So I don't use, I don't wear Glass a whole lot.  I wear it on weekends when I'm out and about.  And I do wear it when I'm playing with the baby and the baby's just starting to learn how to walk now.  So that's been really fun.  Really?  I could help her.  Oh, boy.  You know, yeah.  Yeah, I could help her and hold both her hands and still get footage of that, which is really nice.  So it still does remain like the baby dogs, puppies and kittens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're really you're seeing, I mean, as we talked about the value of Google Now,  you're seeing that what really Google Now needs is a delivery mechanism that's kind of always on.  It's a pain right now to have to not a big pain, but it's a pain to have to look at.  Oh, let me see the card.  Wouldn't it be great if it if it popped up, you go into a restaurant and says, hey, here's how you say, you know,  I want I want bacon and eggs in Turkish on your some sort of display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool. Right. Or your wrist, you know, wrist or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. I don't know how you do it.  Glass is annoying. I mean, there's no perfect solution yet.  It's I think a brain tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you can see that Google Google Now is clearly the software component of this just in time.  Oh, yeah. We know what you want and what you need right now.  Delivery mechanism. They just have to get the hardware side down.  But the software side, they're doing a great job.  Now it's getting better and better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Somebody in the chat room said, I want Google then so I can figure out where I put my keys.  But it could do that. Right.  I mean, theory, it knows more and more about you.  It's it's kind of spooky.  It's really good.  It's true. Yeah, it's true.  What else we got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Google, just a few days after shipping Chrome 30, Google debuted Chrome 31 beta with a few new features.  First is Web payments.  So Web developers will get access programmatic access to the browser's autocomplete information.  So when you when you save your credit card information or your Google Wallet account,  so they can so developers can use a new function that can say,  Hey, you know, use this payment information in order to to go through this payment flow for that for their apps with with users permission.  Of course, there's new portable native code, which gives developers the ability executive executive execute native code in the browser.  So compiled C C plus plus code.  All that means super, super fast and application shortcuts for Android.  So developers can make their websites able to put a shortcut to your desktop or your Android home screen to your aunt, their web, their Web app, which can act like a native like a native app as well.  It can get rid of the chrome and the tabs and just show kind of a special full screen mode, just kind of cool.  And so that's all kind of developer stuff in the new chrome.  And that's chrome 31 beta for desktop and Android.  And finally, HBO shows oatmeal is going to be happy to hear this.  HBO shows are now available on Google Play.  So Game of Thrones, the newsroom, True Blood, the wire, the wire, the wire, all available episode pricing varies from one ninety nine to two ninety nine.  So here's my favorite part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite part is that the newsroom is cheaper than the others because it deserves to be.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get what you pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody who actually works in news hates the newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I needed it, too.  I don't know why I could.  I watched the first episode of this last season.  I literally couldn't watch anymore.  I want you to sound like you like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a totally guilty pleasure of mine.  I watched every episode just so that I could hate on it, just like, I mean, you know, the female characters are terrible.  The dialogue is ridiculous and overblown.  Like it was great.  There were so many things about it that were just ridiculous, but it was like watching a circus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, OK, you know, you know, watching it last season when I went on Twitter to complain, half the people would say, yeah, funny, funny, funny.  I was like, why are you complaining?  They don't watch it.  This season, I get zero reaction to any newsroom tweets.  Nobody's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one's really watching.  Yeah, not not as many people watching it.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's not around much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it got renewed.  I think HBO said we're going to do another season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  You don't have Homeland.  Homeland's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Homeland.  I haven't watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And don't tell me about Breaking Bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was on a boat with you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't watched Breaking Bad at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, guess what?  It's on Google Play.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how I watched it.  Me too.  You know what?  Well, every single episode of Breaking Bad I watched on Google Play, I binge watched to  get caught up.  I actually I didn't like having to lose this savoring that I had on planes.  The only episode I watched on air was the final episode and the commercials drove me  nuts.  It completely cut up the tense mood of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can no longer watch TV with commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, it was such a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I even though I could have watched it for free, I could even watched it on demand for  free, I paid for it on play.  And the reason I use play, and we're going to talk about this later, is because I can  Chromecast it.  And I can watch it on planes.  So I can watch it anywhere.  I can watch.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Highly recommended.  Do it.  It's been on my to-do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because I actually did start to watch it back when I first started airing.  I think I made it through like the half of the season.  But then it got bad and I lost interest.  But then apparently it got really good again.  And then the finale, I guess, was really worth it.  So now that I know that the finale is worth it, I'm willing to go back and rewatch.  I didn't want to be a lost or soprano situation.  I like a satisfying finale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should save it.  I save shows for the old age home.  Because you don't want to get there and you got nothing to do and there's nothing to watch  because you've seen it all.  So save a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we don't watch TV with the baby in the room.  So basically, I can only watch TV after she's gone.  Is this a philosophical thing?  This is, you know, it's our pediatrician talked to us about it.  It's an APA thing.  They actually recommend that kids don't or that you discourage media use.  Not that they don't watch TV, but that you discourage sort of screen time before age  two.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And honestly, what is the thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there have been links, you know, links to obesity.  So they don't grow up to be us, you know.  Yeah, there's links to obesity and ADHD and other sort of attention issues.  And, you know, their brains are developing at a very rapid rate in the first two years,  more rapidly than any other time in their life.  And honestly, if the TV is not in the room, the baby just cranes her head and stares at  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's filling their brain faster than any real experience possibly could.  It's good for them.  No, I'm not kidding.  It's like the thing, remember in the fifth element where she was the alien and she had  to learn everything about civilization.  What did she do?  She watched TV.  She watched it fast forward and was able in three days to learn to speak English and  know exactly everything about culture.  You're depriving your child of a fundamental educational opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When she's two, we will start with the fundamental education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't let my kids watch TV either.  And look what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't?  Okay.  She does stream-pile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watch TV and look what I turn into a TV critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a TV reviewer.  I don't, you know, I wouldn't watch Breaking Bad with Etta in the room.  Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Well, there's that too.  The stuff that we love.  Mommy, I want some of that blue meth.  How do I get that?  Not age appropriate.  Not age appropriate.  You know, Gina, she's going to get back at you because you're going to get barnied to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  death.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to tell you, I'm not looking forward to opening up the Baby Einstein DVDs.  Like, I'm just like, you know, Sesame Street I am looking forward to.  Pixar movies, very much looking forward to.  No, it's not in your control, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would hate to experiment with my child's mushy little brain in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I understand that.  But at the same time, I don't think there's real science behind any of this.  I think it's somebody's good idea.  Like, you know, it's probably not good for them to watch TV.  I don't think there's any science.  Who's going to test one year olds?  Let's take a control group and let them watch TV all they want and another group and let  them not watch and let's see how they turn out in 20.  Nobody's done that.  Right.  Right.  You're probably absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not an absolute at all.  And it's just somebody's good idea.  But I'm not recommending experimenting with your children either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should just do what your gut says.  I mean, she at this point, we just wanted to spend time picking up things and, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  building her fine motor skills and working on, you know, crawling and walking rather  than kind of sitting back.  She would just be mesmerized by the screen.  I think it's moral panic, more moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  I think it would be.  But Gina, Gina, I guess this is the thing that strikes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When my good friend at the time, Peter Travers, is now rolling stone, there were people together  and he had a wonderful son named Alex.  And it was when no gigantic video cameras were out.  And I thought, wow, this is really going to skew this kid's brain because he sees himself  on the TV set.  Right.  Right.  No, it doesn't.  It's video.  What's the big deal?  It's video.  It's video.  Right.  Humans have an amazing ability to adapt to whatever crap is fed to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Anna see herself on TV?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the one thing I do do is I play videos of her that I've taken off her, like on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  phone.  So she loves my phone.  She like looks, you know, like five.  Gina, you've blown it already.  Oh my God.  We video conference with grandma.  You're clearly a mini narcissist.  She also loves looking in the mirror.  I mean, that's the thing that babies do.  They don't realize that it's like another kid there.  You know, they don't realize it themselves right away.  So she kind of, she's kind of like, she's like, she's like, she's like, she's like,  she's like, she's like, she's like, she's like, she's like, she's like, she's like,  So she kind of she, you know, laughs at herself in the mirror.  She likes to watch videos of herself on my phone.  And we do tell we do video conferencing with grandma a few times a week.  So she's not like she's not in front of a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just we just try to keep the so she's going to think the TV is nothing but but grandma's.  Yeah.  Grandma's and her.  It's true.  Why is the TV not talking back to me and saying it loves me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why am I not on TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  She's going to want to know why grandma isn't thinking to her on TV constantly and reacting  to her.  That's true.  Well, that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that, my friends, is the Google change log.  When are you going to give a smart phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, that's a really good question.  We're thankfully pretty far out from that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Five years out at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's already kind of fixated on my phone because I because it's constantly in my hands  and I'm constantly looking at it.  So she wants to know, you know, kind of what's what and then she tries to put it in her mouth.  So I don't know.  We're going to see.  I like to think that it's going to be later on, but I think it's probably going to be  earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was in Europe, in Europe, because of the of the of the tariffs being different  for phone service that you can cost nothing to receive calls.  I knew tons of Europeans who early on gave their five year olds phones.  Why not?  Tons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not?  You can reach them.  If they get lost, they can call home.  But then schools in the US forbid it.  They can generate bitcoins for their college education.  Yeah, it's a useful thing.  Anyway, I don't know.  Let's take a break.  When thank you for the changelog.  I feel up to date now.  Thank you.  We're going to talk about Chromecast and and and Koosh Koosh Koosh.  How do you say Koosh?  There's a U, but the U is silent.

I've been very excited about the Chromecast.  We were just talking about the fact that Jeff and I both buy content on Google Play.  One of the reasons I do is because I have Chromecast all over so I can go,  I can start a show on my phone, on Netflix on my phone or Google Play,  send it to the Chromecast.  I can visit somebody's house.  It doesn't have to be my Chromecast and send the video to there.  The quality is great.  I really like it.  But it's still Netflix, Hulu, I guess is the most recent edition, right?  And Google stuff.  And that's all.  And now it's starting to turn out that maybe Google is slow playing this.  What's going on?  Apparently a lot of companies want to support Chromecast,  but Google is not saying go ahead and do it.  That's weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, why?  Now, so the article that I saw implied that Google is trying to kiss up  to the big media companies.  This would not be the first time Google has done such a thing.  They certainly do that with YouTube.  But that they're not supporting, well, this is from Read, Write, Web.  What's holding up Chromecast apps?  Nothing but Google, Adriana Lee writing.  She talks about Kosh.  Now Kosh, in fact, she even mentions Kosh had lunch,  went to have lunch with the engineers there and came back and saying,  even though they broke my app, the Allcast app, by updating the API,  I don't blame them.  Kosh said, I really think they believe in having an open platform.  But Google has to whitelist an app before it will work on Chromecast,  and they haven't.  Hulu Plus is the only one they've added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you tried to do the Twit stuff?  Was it an API?  Well, it's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so this is the interesting thing.  It's a simple thing to add, apparently.  The code's not complicated.  We don't develop any of our Twit stuff in-house,  so I don't have anything to do with it.  But Houdini 7, Craig Mulaney, who does one of our apps,  says he was going to add it, but they've got to approve it.  Oh, and they're not doing it. That's weird.  And there's just nothing coming out.  In this article, she speaks specifically with the folks at PlayOn.  They have an app called PlayCast.  They want to be able to stream a hidden web browser window on the computer  over to a Chromecast connected TV.  It's just like Chromecast's tabcasting, basically.  They developed the app in a month and a half,  and it's ready, but Google has not yet approved it.  BitCasa, which is an online backup and storage service.  This might be one.  I can understand maybe Google slow playing this one.  They want you to be able to store your videos on BitCasa  and then play it directly back onto the Chromecast.  But Google has yet to say yes.  So I hope that Google isn't just kind of kissing the butts of the big companies  like Clear Channel, like Pandora, like Revision 3, the Washington Post.  I hope that they are open and they want to...  Google says it wants to support all types of apps, including those for local content.  And apparently they've given a very solid API out and an SDK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's something else going on here.  I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope this is not one of those cases. I hope this is not.  Where Google gets in trouble is when it prioritizes a corporate deal over a user.  Right, Verizon. Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't get me started. In fact, you will get me started soon on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All that time you were gone, Leo, nothing's happened.  Nothing. We'll get back to that.  Right, and so that in China, when they do corporate deals,  when they try to suck up to the big guys, that's when they do the wrong thing.  I hope that's not the case. I hope so.  There's some other feature coming or something coming that's just going to make it better  and they're holding off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think the Chromecast is great. I mean, it's 35 bucks.  It's not like I can really complain. It's worth 35 bucks just for what it does now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw it for sale in my Best Buy recently, so they're getting the stock back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I really think that it could be so much better.  I mean, if all of the apps on my phone were Chromecast enabled, I'd be so happy.  Jesus.  Right?  Yeah.  Do you use it, Gina? Do you have a Chromecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it. I love it.  I've been mostly watching Netflix on it, which doesn't, you know,  I mean, you can watch Netflix on pretty much anything.  But yeah, I love it. I was just at a family party.  We were Chromecasting my Flickr album of the baby up on the TV.  Yeah, it's a great device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can even pop the Chromecast in your pocket, bring it and go set it up over there, you know, if you want to.  Yeah, fantastic.  Or a hotel.  Well, you have to be able to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you use your own MiFi or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you... Yeah, well, that's the way to do it. Bring a MiFi and a Chromecast. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chad, go to the three shot.  What? Cats? It's the second cat I've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So this is something I learned. Hi, kitty.  This is something I learned in Turkey and Greece.  Unlike here in the US where they round up feral cats and they, I don't know what they put them in, they put them away.  It's apparently just there's cats everywhere in Turkey and Greece.  So I've decided to increase the cat population of the Brickhouse Studios.  Oh. Yeah.  What does your dog think about this?  Oh, he doesn't know. He thinks he's a cat. He's only he's the same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, they look like there were little animations going by.  No.  Yes. Oh, there's the other one.  There's the other one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's about 12 of them.  No, you're not serious.  Wait a minute. That was a trick.  How did you do that?  Walked right into the TV set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. So what so it is. So all right. So what's the what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the trick? I don't know. It's just a cat. He's itching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this like some game?  Is this Chad?  It's me again.  I thought it was Shutterstock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going on? That's stock footage.  Yay. That's stock footage.  So some of the Shutterstock stock footage is has as a alpha channel so that we can key it in on the and we can put it anywhere.  You can put a cat right here on my desk if you wanted to.  That's brilliant. Yeah.  So see that that that black is keyable.  So we can put that cat anywhere.  And apparently Chad has figured out the magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, Chad would do cats, wouldn't he?  Yeah, he would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's really it is interesting.  It is something I noted that all the ruins have cats everywhere.  Lots of cats and you can't pet them because they're feral.  You don't want to. They're not kitty cats.  You don't want to mess with them.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  There are no rats, however, and that's a good sign.  That's a good point.  Actually, Lisa in our new house has decided that she's going to feed every feral cat comes to the door.  She wants to have because we have three acres.  She wants to make sure there are no rodents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're going to find programmers show up, too.  Yeah, we'll feed any programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So grow house snacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you mentioned the Google.  Yeah, right.  You mentioned the Google Wallet and the change log as of right now.  The Nexus four is right.  The only phone and like it's I can't get it to work on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Google Wallet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a problem of carriers and great.  That's another Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So don't blame Google for that one.  I think it's a carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is working on phones without NFC now.  It's even working on iOS, which doesn't have an NFC.  I mean, you don't have the tap to pay, but you can send money.  You can't even stall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. OK, wait a minute.  Let me look.  So I'm going to search for Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it works on T-Mobile and on open phones, but I don't think it necessarily works on like Verizon phones and AT&T phones.  I think that's only because people were ranting about it in my Verizon rants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going on with my website?  Is this it?  Oh, here's Wallet.  Here's Wallet.  So this is a nice thing about play is the Play Store is I can see immediately which phones I can install.  What is what is going on with my computer?  Are you doing something, Chad?  I swear I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This may be something that happened when you were gone, Leo, but they removed the support for NFC so you can use Wallet without NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now it will install on my other phones.  Oh, yes.  But all my phones had NFC all along.  That's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and then and so with that, they removed a lot of the carriers didn't like it because like Verizon, Verizon has their own payment system that they don't want to put on.  And so it didn't actually want it.  They didn't want Verizon didn't want Google Wallet to actually play.  OK, so I can't install it on a one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have it on your one, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  I just installed it on my one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they must have changed something.  Or updated.  Is your one on Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Chad, are you saying it will now work on Verizon phones because it doesn't have to go to NFC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually not 100 percent sure if this will work on all carriers.  But I know that because of the NFC take, you know, they've removed that that that it's now on almost any phone.  I can now install on my Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't do it before.  So this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can send money.  You can store loyalty card information.  You can't do the tap to pay.  Yes.  But well, I don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't able to use it at all.  It wasn't installed on a lot of my phones.  So they've changed that.  They have. They've changed that fairly recent.  Well, yeah, it's well, I was since I've been gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just installed on the Moto X.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's another story that the moving staff over to wallet, they're going to try to make some push in the wallet.  Well, that's why I bring it up.  Yeah.  Amazon has also started a pay with Amazon feature going out.  So there's a war, a war.  There is a war going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've just been doing some development on something I'll have more information about soon.  Not today, but I've been doing some.  You know, I was in a position where I had to choose a payment vendor for a thing.  And I looked at, you know, we looked at Stripe and we looked at Amazon payments and looked at Google Wallet and we looked at PayPal.  And we actually wanted to go going with Amazon, Amazon payments.  Oh, really?  Partially. Yeah.  Partially because it sort of fulfilled that we had sort of special requirements.  But yeah, I mean, there's you know, it's it's not that it's not that easy for development.  Like there's a lot that could be done still.  Like these systems could be a lot easier to implement.  Stripe is really great.  I just didn't like with Stripe.  You know, you have to enter your credit card like on the spot.  And I like the idea of signing into a trusted vendor.  I'm not a big fan of PayPal.  So, you know, Amazon is like a lot of people, you know, our our intended audience have Amazon accounts.  They've saved their credit cards.  You can do that kind of instant pay here.  You don't have to get up from your machine and find your credit card or, you know, if you save your credit card details.  So that made sense for us.  But I think that there's a lot here that Google could do.  This is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is all new and different since I've been gone.  This is all happened.  So I was not able to install it before I am able to install it.  I can add credit cards to it.  I can, as you say, send money, save offers and loyalty programs.  It's got all my recent transactions on here.  This is great.  So finally, I've been waiting for wallet to take off.  So I can send you money directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the problem with wallet from my perspective, from my perspective as a developer, I just don't think a lot of people have wallet accounts.  Not as many people have wallet accounts as have Amazon accounts or as I or, you know, have iTunes accounts.  Yes.  So as a developer, you want to choose the friction, the most friction free path toward getting money.  Right. So you're still Google's not there yet, but this is a good this is a good start.  I mean, right now, what are you know, when do you create your wallet account when you want to purchase something from the Play Store?  Google's getting better with that.  People are more particular purchasing at purchasing apps and media.  But I don't you know, you don't think Google when you want to send somebody money, right?  When I when I want to send somebody money, I think we'll chase that now, which is one of my one of my banks.  PayPal, even though PayPal makes me feel kind of icky, it actually does work.  A lot of people have PayPal accounts really thanks to eBay.  Right. But you still don't feel great about that.  There's still not like a great, obvious, easy solution.  And so Google, you know, Google has to be in a position where lots everybody has a wallet account.  You know, you have to developers have to feel like, oh, everybody's got a wallet account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so how could all right, Gina, how could Google because Google has the market power to own something.  What could they give that would make people all of a sudden sign up for Wallet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, they tried those promotions where it was like, hey, you can get these movies for 10 cents.  All you have to do is create a wallet account and pay the 10 cents. Right.  Like I think that the push like like little incremental promotional pushes like that.  I mean, what Google has to do is they have to sell something in the Play Store that's so compelling that everyone must have on the Chromecast is a good example.  You know, and they have to, you know, they create a wallet account kind of in the process.  And I think just in general, like Google is not the company that you go to to sit for monetary transactions.  Right. I mean, you go there for Gmail and you go there for search and maps.  Right. But I think part of it is just a perception issue.  You know, I go to Amazon. I'm going to I've been buying stuff on Amazon for decades.  I trust them like they buy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is from not me. Six thirteen in the chat room makes a very good point.  Retailers are afraid of Amazon.  They're not going to support Amazon payments because that's just giving Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. And that's why PayPal, PayPal, which is the friend of stores.  Right. Is really making a push to get into more and more stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google could be in that position. I don't know. Do people trust PayPal?  I mean, the reputation PayPal has generated over the last few years has not been good.  Not been good for nerds. I think that's among geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only gals know that. I think so.  But Google's a big, you know, it's going to be a fascinating battle.  And it's a marketing push. Get half off your Starbucks coffee.  Somebody is going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's historically terrible at that, though, aren't they? Yes.  Well, they're not a marketer. They're a terrible marketer. True, true.  So I don't you know, I want I would I would rather use wallet or maybe Apple passbook.  The problem with that is you have to have an iPhone.  But I would rather use that than anything that you've just mentioned, including Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I do pay. Remember back to the day my friend you better Chardonnay started a firefly at MIT Media Lab.  And it got bought because it had passport in it, which was Microsoft.  Right. Microsoft way back when thought it could be this single Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Microsoft couldn't do it.  All right. Let's talk about the Nexus five.  We've been putting it off, putting it off, putting off.  Is there going to be a Nexus five?  Is it going to be as some have said this month in like a week, two weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we don't know. We don't know for sure.  Nothing. Yeah. I mean, the last rumor I heard about date was October 15.  That's that's like this coming Monday.  But the thing is, if they're going to ship this thing before the holidays, it's got to happen in the next couple of weeks.  Right. Because then you start to run into into Thanksgiving and they got to have it out before the holidays.  So that was that was a couple of weeks ago and all that Android.  We were taught they were talking about October 14, 15.  Now we have the iPad announcement that's supposed to happen like the 22nd.  We got we know that for sure.  We know that for sure.  Well, because all things D is pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Connected, they say for sure.  October 22nd, that will be we don't know what it announced, but the suspicion is a new iPad, both the big version and the mini as well as a new Mac Pro.  We know that, you know, they're going to announce that.  But I they've already done the iPhone.  Yeah, yeah, I'd love to see a Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And next couple weeks, I would say, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the reports, one of the reports said that it was going to just like the Nexus seven, allegedly.  We'll get that in a minute is supposed to work on across CDMA and GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good. If that doesn't that's the next big that's for sure.  The next big thing, because CDMA is moving to LTE.  And so all you have to do is support LTE.  And that means everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, though, you don't have the ratchet down to 3G if you don't have right coverage.  Right. But that's OK.  But Verizon still still still still still hasn't done Jacko.  And with government shutdown, there's no FCC to go after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you mind, Leo, going down to if I may do a good point, actually, will that hold up the Nexus five because the FCC can't do anything they can't have very good point.  They can't prove anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't prove anything. You can't get a new fellow arrive at my school and she can't get open a bank account because she can't get a social security number.  Oh, gee. So do me a favor, if you would, and go to the under under other.  There's there's another guy named Jarvis. No relation.  Tim Jarvis went to on Twitter, went to VZW support and said, if I may do a dramatic reading here,  Android 4.4 is coming by the end of October. Will my Galaxy Nexus get 4.3 by then?  Verizon responds. Let's keep your phone running smooth. I don't have any info. Visit this address for updates.  Are you having issues? Tim comes back and says, Yes, I have an issue.  My Nexus software is out of date and needs an update to 4.3. Verizon responds.  Like a pillow. We are here to support you.  Are you able to make and receive calls? Is the Internet slash web working properly?  This is not a human that he's talking to. It's gotta be a bot.  Tim Jarvis responds. Yes, the phone works properly. However, it is a Nexus device and should have the latest version of Android, which it does not.  Verizon's response. Woohoo! Thanks for keeping us posted. I'm glad to see that your device is working properly. You rock!  Oh my God!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To which Tim Jarvis finally says, Woohoo! You ignorant goose penis. My Nexus is still in need of an update to 4.3 and soon will need 4.4, but no, VZW sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that the greatest? Ignorant goose penis might be my new favorite put down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you goose penis you. I don't even know goose's have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how would there be? How would there be gander? How would there be ganders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, not all animals have never mind. Well, that's true.  It sounds like the Howard Stern show. Actually, it's a very interesting question. It is. OK, Google now.  Oh, boy. What animals don't have penises?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is the part where Twig turns into the Howard Stern show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're welcome, Jada. You're right. Seven animals with the weirdest genitalia on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, Google now. Do geese have penises?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do that. You're on a Nexus. Wow. What do you mean?  Anyway, I just hit the button. Oh, you had to hit a button. I see. I didn't have to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, poor me. Poor me. We don't even have to touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I took the Moto X with me the whole time. Excellent choice for traveling because it's light and small.  It was very effective. Battery life was good. It was a perfect phone for traveling about tither and thither.  They did update it about a week ago with apparently new camera firmware, among other things, and I didn't notice much of an improvement.  I also have it. If I'd had it, I would have brought it the new iPhone 5S because this camera, I have to say, is a great camera on the 5S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iPhones have great cameras. They always have. How do you like it? So what are you doing now? Are you double fisting the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, because then I also have. Oh, boy. Oh, the Galaxy Note 3, which just came in with its.  You liked your Note 2 in the day. I was. I had a Note 1 and a 2 was.  But, you know, it's funny after using the Moto X, this thing feels so big. It's a gorgeous.  Well, so is the Nexus 5 going to? Yeah. Well, I don't know how big is the Nexus 5.  Did they say 5 inches? 4.8 inches, I think. That's not that big. The HTC One is what, 4.7.  But this is a very high resolution screen. It really is a gorgeous. Am I interested in Justin Donnelly's commute?  I don't know why it's even asking me that. No. Apparently, Justin Donnelly has now allowed me to look at his commute.  I don't. He's I guess he's somebody I circled. But, you know, I think the screen is gorgeous.  It has this bizarre stitched pleather back. It is weird.  And it also and I'm not sure what the story is. It does not use micro USB. It uses some odd connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a big. Looks like USB 3. It is USB 3, but you can still use micro USB with USB 3.  Where do you plug it? It's on the on the left side. You just pull it in. Just plug it there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because one thing that I think is going to happen, though, the European Union is really getting serious about all phones have to have micro USB.  Well, what's Apple going to do? Well, right now they ship an adapter. I don't know. I don't know.  Anyway, big, big, big iPhone 5S fingerprint reader works.  Don't know if that's enough to make it compelling.  I have to say going after using Android for so long, going back to configure a brand new iPhone just felt a little painful.  So I gotta do that. The nice. Now, that's not Apple's fault. Google stuff works best with Google. Right.  So you enter the Google account once, for instance, on an Android phone and every Google app now knows, you know, oh, that's you on an iPhone.  You have to go. You know, or it's one of you, which is my problem. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep buying things in play with the wrong account because I set it up under one account, not the other account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's confusing. But you can have that problem on iOS as well. I different iCloud account. It's very really.  Yeah. For a while I was getting my son's photo stream. That was enlightening from his freshman year in college.  Not so bad. I was more worried about him getting my photo stream actually.  My eyes. So what's your problem with Verizon? You have a note. What? What is your problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you dare forget. I have my my nice, wonderful Nexus seven and announced in July.  I've had it now for what? Five weeks. And it's an LTE based. It's an LTE based and Verizon still will not connect.  Yeah, because it's not they're allegedly open network. They're supposedly certified B.S. Verizon.  There's no such thing on an open network. It's there. It's a lie. I filed a complaint with the FCC Verizon responded.  I filed back. But now the FCC is out of business. Hmm. Yeah, that's that doesn't seem right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember the story now. As long as you're as long as you remember, I do. I do.  And I want to get you started. So let's do the we're going to do a new segment, the Jeff Jarvis rant segment.  You've got some things. There's a bill, for instance, a foot in Israel that would require Google to pay seven percent of its Israeli revenues to websites.  Miss Sugar. So unfortunately, the full text is available for some. It's got its behind a paywall, of course.  So I don't know what the rest of this is that I don't know. No, there's a paywall.  It comes up a little bit. Oh, I got the really good before. Yeah, no, I have a paywall. So since you read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So who what websites? It's just content sites wanting to it's the same as the Germans and the French, which we'll get to in a second.  And others just thinking Google has money and we don't. And that's not fair.  So they should give us some of our money because Google Google wouldn't exist if they weren't free riding on the back of these websites and they wouldn't exist on the Internet without Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a mutually beneficial relationship. You bet it is. And then if that's not enough to get your blood pressure up, Jeff, I'm trying to kill him.  French minister pushes Google tax to bridge telcos funding shortfall.  Ned, the top five and then the top five US based Internet companies are stifling European innovation, says a French tax them like crazy to take money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not going to actually cause people to really compete and really innovate and really create things.  We're just going to give him a French dole. Her name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. The French minister for the digital economy's name is Fleur Pedarin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also, she's the minister for the digital economy.  Digital and she's trying to punish digital companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says Europe is being relegated to second league in the digital economy.  We are second league. So they want to tax the largest US over the top Internet providers, including Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For reasons that make no sense, a follow up on the get the reggae ready.  Is there more? Well, there was because what happened was we got instituted and then every single media company had to surrender.  Right. And sign on for Google. Right. So because they weren't getting any traffic. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I hope the Nexus five comes out because I don't have enough phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I want to tell you this too. I'm not putting it on Verizon. Verizon's not put it on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're crazy to buy a locked phone of any kind.  You should, especially as you travel, you should buy an unlocked GSM phone and put a T-Mobile SIM in it.  T-Mobile. Yeah. And then when you get somewhere, buy a SIM there.  I don't know why anybody would buy a locked CDMA phone. Doesn't make sense to me.  Did you read the so Nick Bilton's book about Twitter is about to come out?  Boy, I can't wait to read this. There's an excerpt in The New York Times talking about the founding of Twitter in a playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The leader of it is a playground, which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it also talks about the revisionist story of the founding of Twitter in which Jack Dorsey basically tries to completely eliminate the role of Noah Glass,  who even in this book came up with the word Twitter, the name Twitter.  He was one of the founders of Odeo, which was the parent company along with Evan Williams, that eventually came up with Twitter.  Odeo was a podcast company. Right. And I just want to underscore this.  Twitter existed before Odeo existed, long before Twitter existed.  We had a trademark on the name Twitter.  Almost certainly Noah Glass, who's created a company that distribute podcasts, had heard of Twitter, which was the number one podcast at the time.  And yet he says, I was looking through a dictionary for words.  And I have to thank Nick Bilton because when he did it, he Nick listed the T.  So apparently Noah had a dictionary going through looking for names for Twitter.  See if I can find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did Bilton mention Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he didn't mention Twitter exactly.  But he went through the list of T words and Twitter was one of them that they were considering.  I once asked Evan Williams, didn't you think that that might impinge?  Here it is. Soon the question of a name came up.  Williams jokingly suggested calling the project Friend Stalker, which was ruled out as too creepy.  Although it is one of the ways people use it.  Glass became obsessive, flipping through a physical dictionary, almost word by word, looking for the right name.  One late afternoon alone in his apartment, he reached over to his cell phone and turned it to silent, which caused it to vibrate.  He quickly considered the name vibrate, which he nixed.  But it led him to the word Twitch.  He dismissed that too, but he continued through the T.W. section of the direct dictionary.  Twist, twit, Twitch, Twitchy, and then there it was.  He read the definition aloud.  The light chirping sound made by certain birds.  This is it, he thought.  Agitation or excitement.  Flutter, Twitter.  No, the URL was available.  Well, it didn't have any vowels originally, right?  It was T.W.T.T.R.  That's right. It wasn't available. That's right.  All right.  Anyway, apparently Dorsey worked hard to get Glass's name completely out of the founding legend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much stock does Glass have, I wonder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.  All these guys making a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ev has the lion's share.  Ev will be a billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I respect, I don't know Ev, and maybe you guys do, but I'm sure you've spoken to him.  I've never even.  I know Ev.  I've had a couple of interviews.  I know Ev.  What I like about it is when Odeo went under, he gave the investors money back.  Yeah.  Which I thought was, that's pretty respectable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had amazing coverage.  Nick Denton came to me.  Nick Denton is the guy who showed me Blogger.  It's all his fault.  And I said, what's the big deal?  And then when Blogger was about to fold one of many times, he got me to get my bosses, the new houses, to invest.  To save it one of many times.  And I had amazing meetings with Ev at the time.  You know, some of the great meetings I love is watching.  I watched Mark Zuckerberg do the same thing, where they kind of don't know how some of this business, strange business stuff works.  They've got a great idea.  They don't know what's what.  And they kind of scratching their heads.  And then you see them turn into amazing business people.  But yeah, Ev kept this company.  You know, it was very controversial because all the staff left and everything else.  He kept the thing operating in his kitchen, but he believed in it and he kept it alive.  I respect the heck out of that.  Yeah.  And sold it to Google and stayed at Google as long as he had to.  And then changed the world again with Twitter.  And then, you know, I can't wait to read Nick's book to see what the real story is of the various backstabbings there.  Oh, it's a mess.  It's great.  It's a soap opera.  And I think not just not just the founders and the executives, but also the board, I think is probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  They talk about the uncomfortable conversation where they moved Ev upstairs.  Yeah.  Just fascinating stories.  Nick Bilton's book will be called Hatching Twitter, a true story of money, power, friendship and betrayal.  It comes out the next month.  We will absolutely talk to him about it.  It should be very interesting.  Dorsey will make 400 to 500 million dollars when Twitter goes public.  Ev will make well over a billion dollars when Twitter goes public.  What do you make of this whole frou-frou?  And Anil Dash is involved.  So I know, and of course, you work with Anil at ThinkUp.  Over the lack of women on the board and in the upper management of Twitter, do you think this is an issue, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's always an issue for me.  I mean, the lack of women in any kind of positions of power in general is always an issue of interest to me.  I know that there's been a little flutter recently.  So there's no women.  What's the story?  There's no women on the Twitter board.  And Dick was sort of quoted as saying that it's a big problem they have to work on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His initial reaction was kind of a jokey reaction comparing the guy who's complaining to Carrot Top.  But then in a subsequent tweet, he said, hey, look, I'm really, this is on my mind all the time.  We're looking.  Although the New York Times published a great piece, Claire Kane Miller, who wrote the original piece about this,  then published a follow up piece with 45 women who would be perfectly well qualified to be on Twitter's board.  So he can't be looking that hard.  Maybe he has a buzzfeed list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not a very good list, I might add.  It includes Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this isn't the buzzfeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a good list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These conversations are always that there's a supply problem, right?  This is what these guys always say.  There's a supply problem.  There aren't enough women executives.  From my perspective, that's not the case.  But my perspective is someone who thinks about this, who lives this.  I mean, the fact is that you, and I think that this is natural human nature.  You surround yourself with people who are like you.  And it's a problem.  It's definitely a problem in the Valley.  I think that if Twitter had been thinking really hard about it sooner,  they wouldn't be having this conversation right now.  Do I think that they're like any more sexist than any other company in the Valley?  No, I mean, I think this is sort of this is the status quo right now.  I do think that it needs to change and it's changing, you know, slowly.  I mean, even over the past three years, we've seen some changes, but no, I definitely think it is an issue.  Look, anytime I go to any executive page on a company website or a conference speaker page,  I immediately notice, because these are sort of just the glasses that I look through,  which is an issue that's close to my heart, I notice.  I notice how many, what the ratio of men to women is.  And I notice the ratio of white to, you know, brown skin people as well.  And I notice age as well.  Well, that's another point. It's all white men.  Yeah, and I notice age as well.  You know, if it's always, you know, if it's all young people, that makes me nervous.  And older people, that also makes me nervous.  So, you know, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three of ten on Google's board are women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Okay. That's not terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have mixed feelings about it.  I don't know if you, I mean, it's not a... these are private companies.  It's not like... I mean, I agree.  And believe me, my company is run by women, so I'm not, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a values expression.  I mean, Leo, you clearly care about this because you just look at the makeup of your hosts and your management.  Your leadership. This is clearly something...  I mean, if you're not even thinking... if you're not thinking about it explicitly,  you're at least the kind of person who surrounds himself by people who are different than him, right?  I mean, that's the reason why I'm here.  And this is the other thing, is that hiring women makes it easier to hire more women.  Hiring people of color makes it easier to hire more people of color, right?  Because, you know, people notice these things as my rant. That's my rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So two of eight on Facebook are women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I hate to do it by quota, like, oh, we got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think... but the point is it's not hard. You can do it.  And by the way, I nominate Susan Crawford to any board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put her on it.  And it's a number, by the way, not 45, but 25, Claire Kane Miller's list of 25 women  who would be appropriate to be on Twitter's board.  Many of them are on boards of other very big companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the supply argument has some legs if you're trying to talk about large numbers, right?  You have 100 speakers at a conference.  And if you only have one woman, that's bad.  But to try to argue that you're going to get 70, that's maybe hard.  OK, I will grant that. Or a whole staff, it's harder.  This has been an issue in journalism for years, trying to get people of color in the newsrooms is very difficult.  Just because of the numbers that are there.  All right, so there is, at the gross level, there's a supply problem.  But if you're filling a board, then just not thinking of this going in.  The other thing is argued, too, is not just diversity of gender and race.  It's also a perspective. You get companies like Google.  You know, having someone from India on that board is important because having international perspectives on these boards are important.  Twitter is primarily an international company.  So that's an issue, too.  You got to have a gene is right.  It's enlightened self-interest to connect yourselves to other networks of people.  And the board is one way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they should be doing it.  I got to say, I mean, I got to say, I didn't I didn't think, oh, I need to have a woman running the company.  I do. I do think about the representation on air because I want to make sure that girls don't think that this is a male that technology is just for men.  So I do think about that a little bit in terms of hosts.  But I didn't choose Lisa as a CEO because she was a woman.  I chose her because she was the right candidate.  She was the best person for the job.  And she also wanted the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, she she asked for the job.  I mean, she did ask, but she put herself on the and I hope I'm not revealing anything.  Right. But she put herself she made herself a candidate.  Oh, yes.  Women need to do more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's something Lisa's very good at.  She does not stand offish.  She is she and this is what Sheryl Sandberg talks a little bit about, too, is she is just like a guy in that respect.  She says, no, I'm the right person.  Yeah. How about me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we said we actually went to her and said, could you have anybody recommend to be our CFO?  She said, yeah, me.  And the truth is, when she said that, I said, really?  You would consider that?  And she said, yeah, I said, you're you're hired because she was the right person.  But but I do and we do try to get on air, you know, and channel vouch for this.  A lot of times to the Twitter panel on Sundays is all men.  And I say, can't we get any women?  I also say, can't we get any people of color?  That's actually harder than women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure.  Well, this is yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure in our industry, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but I also hate it's funny.  I hate to say, oh, you've got to have women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not it's not, quote, I think properly.  It's it's again, it's I'll say it one more time.  It's a light in self-interest.  It's saying that I'm going to as Gina said, well, you're going to tie yourself into various networks of people have different perspectives.  That's what you want to see illustrated.  Yes, because it's good business.  Yeah. And it's not it's not about trying to hit a number.  It's good business.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to I want to get our tip, our tool, our number of the week.  I guess my tool, I'm going to talk a little bit about this galaxy here.  I haven't really done a lot with it, but it's what I can tell you a little bit about my initial fashionable on you.  It actually looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it looks pretty nice.  It looks really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's got a beautiful screen.  Huh?  All it needs is one of those tiny keyboards and a pocket protector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it's better than that.  But I don't think I don't know.  We'll talk about it.  All right.  We'll talk.  Let me talk first about another new advertiser.  I am so happy to have personal capital on.  We interviewed the founder of personal capital, former PayPal guy, a really smart guy talking about this is the new thing.  You know, I for years I used quick and I balanced my checkbooks and I did it all in my head, you know, and I got a stock online stock account.  And this is the next generation in beyond even, you know, budgeting and managing your checkbook.  This isn't managing your financial life.  Personal capital.

We've got it now.  And I want you to take a look at it.  Personal capital dot com slash twig.  It is faboo.  And I can say that I've having used it now for more than a year.  Let us get our tool and tip and number of the week starting with everybody saying, aren't you going to talk about the new Google Maps?  Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just got published.  I think we might have even started the show or might have been in pre show Google Maps rolling out two new really nice features.  First, this is in the Google Maps preview, the new redesigned Google Maps directions for multiple destinations.  I guess is one of their most most requested features in the new Google Maps.  So when you when you pop in a destination, you ask for directions.  This is rolling out slowly.  And I actually don't have it in my Google Maps yet.  So you might not have it in yours coming out next week or the next few days.  Maybe there is a plus signs you can add another destination so you can plan a multi destination.  I love that road trip or cycling trip.  Yeah, yeah, really nice.  What else we got here? A few other things.  You can see your flight hotel and restaurant reservations in write in maps.  Just search for your departing airport or dining destination will instantly show your upcoming plans.  This is a really nice.  This is integration with the Gmail, you know, linking your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like Tripit. Oh, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very nice. And upcoming events.  So if you search for something like Radio City Music Hall, for example, local performance venues, you'll see a click on the upcoming events card.  Again, we have these the cards, which is Google's new design, you know, most modern sort of design language.  You'll see a schedule of concerts, sports matches and other events happening near you.  So, yeah, some really nice updates there are maps.  Again, I'm not seeing this in my current maps, but should be coming out rolling out the next couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have it either.  When they updated maps, I was kind of disappointed because it got so stark.  It was it did less. Yes.  And I guess that was that was laying the foundation for what they're what they're going to do, which was add add to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear that Google takes away stuff just to see what they get the most complaints about and then adds that back in slowly.  Yeah. Yeah.  I think that's how they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be a little worried if I use Tripit.  I love Tripit. Tripit monitors my Gmail when it sees confirmation emails, it builds an itinerary automatically for me.  It's a website and an app.  And I used it on this most recent trip.  And it's a really great way to keep track of stuff to know when your your confirmations are and stuff.  But if that were built in automatically to Google Maps, it is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I should say that this this blog post says this will be rolling out today.  So we should see it today. Oh, I agree, though.  I love Tripit. Yeah.  But it just sort of makes sense that this that would be a Google Now thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's scary if you're if you're a company that Google knows everything about everybody.  It's very hard to compete in certain spaces.  The information relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Relationships are the future of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeffrey Jarvis.  Numero numero.  We go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you say that in Turkish?  You'll find out from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, Google, how do I say number, please, in Turkish?  Unfortunately, doesn't say it out loud.  Yeah, it just but it does show it, which is cool.  Oh, no, it doesn't. Oh, I think I'm supposed to say translate or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Oh, OK. Well, never mind.  So the number of URLs taken down by Google has gotten to be amazing.  More than eight pirate links is quote unquote pirate links every second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What do you mean taken down like taken out of the search results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Wow.  So between in the summer of 2012, Google got one point eight million link take down notices a week.  That's increased now to five point three million a week.  A four thousand percent increase covering fifty four hundred copyright owners on thirty seven thousand domains.  All right. So so the claim that Google's not doing anything with copyright is B.S.  Then the same story from The Guardian.  It says that a report published by the London School of Economics found that that quote,  evidence does not support claims about overall revenue reduction due to individual online copyright infringement.  So it's saying that, for example, UK revenues from online music were higher than revenues for both CD and vinyl combined for the first time in 2013.  Worldwide sales of recorded music increased in 2012 for the first time since 1999.  The movie industry, despite claims of piracy, is devastating them, found revenues hit three thirty five billion, making a six percent increase over 2011.  And this quote, file shares in the UK were found to spend more on content than those who only consumed legal content,  demonstrating the potential boost to legal digital content sales as a result of content sampling.  Notice the verb Sam Sam piracy. Yeah.  I ran a most of the day panel at a World Economic Forum event last week here in New York.  And it was all about trying to understand this era and try to get to a new regime.  And pretty much everybody in the room, there are a lot of showbiz companies in the room admitted that copyright's broken, that it's not the solution, that suing people and fighting people is not the solution.  I fought against using the words copyright and intellectual property even in the discussion, because it's a presumption to think it's property.  And that's the way we look at it.  So I hope that we're maybe we can start to head toward a saner view of what sampling and sharing and creation means.  So that's it for my highfalutin number. I want to do one more thing. Get your classes ready, folks. Get them ready.  Get them ready. The man who created the concept of the Gutenberg parenthesis that I talked about in the show,  he claimed that Pettit, who's a professor in D.C. and Denmark, is coming to speak at my school at CUNY on October 17th.  Just Google Gutenberg parenthesis CUNY October 17th and you'll find it. And if you're in New York, come on by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool. Thomas Pettit. He's coming to town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come into New York and the Gutenberg parenthesis will have I wish actually what we should do is have scotch there like Apple meetings and everybody can download.  Every time I say Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's from USD, the University of Southern Denmark.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not Northern Denmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, don't be confused. There's a big difference.  It's kind of a rivalry, you know, going on.  So the Galaxy Gear is here. I'm going to review this.  By the way, it only works right now with the Galaxy Note.  So I have the Note 3 and the Galaxy Gear. I will review both on Tuesday on Before You Buy.  But it's kind of the pairing is very interesting.  So it comes with a cradle that you put the watch in to charge it.  I don't yet know what the battery life is, but I suspect not very long.  And the cradle also has an NFC chip on it.  So in order to pair this, you could do it manually.  You tap the phone on the cradle.  The phone says, oh, you have a Galaxy Gear.  Would you like to download the software?  You do. And it automatically sets up the Bluetooth and everything, which is kind of cool.  This is the Gear Manager. You can see the gear is connected.  The gear. This is pretty much out of the box.  By the way, great looking OLED screen.  It is a touch screen so I can swipe through, look at contacts, logs.  Well, it's call logs, by the way, missed calls and so forth.  So I could see who called me and who didn't call me.  I can also run a variety of apps.  You install the apps from your phone so you can see what apps are installed, including S Voice.  So I guess I can dictate it to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's a Samsung App Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. All of this is Samsung.  This is not, you know, in fact, playing my almost immediate reaction to this Note 3 is, oh, this is I can't do it because it's so Samsung eyes.  For instance, on the Note 3, you have a swipe up, which reminds me a little bit of the swipe up on the on the iPhone 5 that gives me some sort of weird.  I don't I mean, I don't know if it's bad, but it's just like this is not how do you get to Google now?  Well, right. It's like and then, you know, the touch is so different.  And I don't know, I just I'm going to I probably have to customize this thing.  Maybe even anyway, the watch is pairs with it.  It does require the Galaxy Gear.  A couple of things when you get up and walk away from your phone, the gear buzzes and says you've lost Bluetooth connection.  You won't lose your phone that way.  You can also do it in the other direction.  I could say find my gear. Where do I leave my watch?  Where is it?  And it will find your gear.  The gear turns itself off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing. Yeah, that's that's I look at a watch.  It's always on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not how this works.  It does allow you to choose watch face.  I mean, look, it's not a watch.  It's something else. It does allow you to choose watch faces.  I'm using the weather clock, but it has other watch faces, including a pedometer clock, because there's a pedometer built into it.  So you can see how your steps are going.  I like the idea of being able to swipe through this.  You know, it has a camera right here.  I haven't really played much with that yet.  You know, I just got it.  But it's, you know, media controller.  I could see a gallery of images I've taken on my camera, that kind of thing.  I don't know. I'm intrigued.  It's you know, I really was expecting something really horrific from all the reviews.  I think it looks all right.  It's rubber band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not bad looking.  It's not horrible.  It's not horrible looking.  It's not horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. I think a couple hundred bucks, right?  And you have to have the note, at least for now.  Although they say that with the upgrade to KitKat, is it KitKat or 4.3?  I can't remember.  With the upgrade on the GS4 and the GS3, you should be able to use this with some of the other Samsung devices.  No word yet as to whether it'll work with anything besides Samsung.  My guess is not.  So I'll have a full review.  I mean, I think there's room in this marketplace.  I have a pebble to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's most interesting is not this device per se, but what they're capable of, what they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just, it's early, early days yet.  And while glass is interesting, I would love to see Google now here.  Somewhere it needs to be easier to see than pulling out the phone.  300 bucks, $299.  I mean, I spent a lot more than that for a watch.  It's not the most attractive watch ever.  But I'll have a full review for you after I've played with this for a little bit longer.  I just put it together yesterday.  And yes, it has an excellent ad.  So that's good. That's a good thing.  Oh yeah, that ad was good.  It was pretty cute. Yeah.  Yeah.  Should we show the Galaxy Gear ad?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone was saying that it was a ripoff from Apple's Hello ad, but...  It was only ripoff in so far as that it was a mashup of people using a smartwatch, you know?  And Apple did an ad in like 2007 of people saying hello into the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. No, this is, I think this is kind of, kind of cool because it's...  There it is.  ...transmitter.
