Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually my Twitter currently Twitter account and Facebook again are active because I have to periodically  activate them I activate them and forgot to  deactivate them but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I start with one danger danger danger danger Europe, please what happens that signals 11 and 13 are back on  Julia Rada  the  Green member of the European Parliament describes them and it really it is it is  Heroine I can't find this piece. Yes, if she has quick bill of points, but it's heroin how this ruins the  Internet this is so people gone nuclear. So let's let's let's talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What start with 11 what is 11 the and by the way, this is articles in what in a you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Articles in a new copyright and across European copyright because now copyright is done by  By country basically, this is an effort to kind of a and and a lot of people including the platforms  Welcome to the idea of a single market view  Where did I put it on the rundown? I can't find it. Well, I have in front of me  Well, I know I was gonna have to so Julia Rita dot EU

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Second from the bottom another for two years. They debated different drafts and versions of the controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Articles 11 and 13, but now there is no more ambiguity  The law will fundamentally change the internet as we know it now, by the way  We should say Julia's dead set against it if it's adopted in the upcoming final vote we can still prevent that but here's the final  text  So should we start with 11 or 13 which are 11 so 11 is a so-called link tax

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So reproducing more than single words or very short extracts will require a license

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is aimed at Google that means you or me this is aimed at Google search though the snippets that they put in the search results  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this this but they can't just pass a law against Google so they pass it against every user  So every time you want to quote someone and quoted at length and say something about it  Which we would call free speech fair comment good common sense and liberal democracy. You won't be able to do it  You'll have to go and get a license. Yeah, that's how blogging started. That's what blogging was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw this text I think this yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at if you want to if you want a sample of what that looks like look at daring fireball net John Gruber's  Blog which it's it's always extensive comments from another story that he then like comments on this is very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Traditional style blogging in Europe will be illegal without license even for services run by individuals read bloggers small companies  nonprofits  So that's that is that alone that kills  Free speech on the net it kills the ability to talk about something it kills the ability to quote something it kills  The essence of what journalists do all the time isn't this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In against the interests of the publishers don't these quotes help drive traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, cuz they think that this is what this is the I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it like the origins of this is the  Should crack. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I look at for instance, I look at a John Gruber post  He's quoting John Pachkowski for BuzzFeed  He has he doesn't even I think have any commentary on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then there's a link that I would then click they consider the publishers starting with with with Springer and Borda consider that theft  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you got on Gruber site you got a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely  Absolutely, but they want to go out. This is how they it's not just that it's not just that they want them to stop that  They want to put them in a legal bind that says this means you're stealing from us and you should give us money  Your witness will get to Gavin Newsom in a little bit Gavin Newsom is talking about, you know a  Digital the governor of California. Yeah, sorry governor of California  Where the platforms owe everybody everything just because they make money and full disclosure here. I raised money from Facebook for my school  I'm independent of Facebook. I received a money person from any of the platforms. I do own stock in  Google and Amazon and of disclosure. Thank you very much. Thank you for reminding me of doing that last week Stacey, but  This kills the net this kills what what was their plan is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Axel's plan Axel Springer's plan  Oh, they'll still push published links, but they'll give us some money for doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the hope of what happened in the German law was that Google said fine  Then we're not gonna license from you. We'll stop linking to you and the publishers all came back on their knees saying oh, please  Okay, we'll say okay and link that in Spain  The same law was passed but there was no exception allowed  You couldn't give permission for it to happen  You had to have a license arrangement and that's why Google pulled Google News out of Spain  Google has threatened to at least pull Google News out of Europe and  Has shown a version of what Google would look like without under this law

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So beat master who's a Swiss in our a chat room and so the Swiss are very neutral says alright  Let's let's pose the opposite argument if people read the headlines or even read it if people read a snippet  They're not gonna click the link because they're gonna get the gist of the article and move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard that argument for a long time believe me  But also also lots of a you can't you there's no way to measure you're proving a negative B  You shouldn't get by that is that is that how many people would have gone to it Oh that story bores me  I read the headline. I'm glad I avoided it. Thank you very much, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be my favorite way my favorite Twitter account is saved you a click  Yeah, where the headline poses a question, but doesn't give you the answer  So you have to click the link and the saved you a click just gives you the answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because because the business model here is to drag hoon you into clicking they're out of business by the way  The second part is is that is that?  How many articles are discovered because of these links that you would never have seen  So and by the way Google and Facebook are now helping publishers with their subscription plans, which I think is also doom  But that's another story  And they're and they're trying to help drive traffic down the funnel to these publishers  So this is a this is a vindictive act of corporate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  protectionism, but what but okay, so you could argue that's why these corporate interests wanted it, but if the  EU passes it that's not a that's not a vindictive act. That's because the  EU Parliament said yeah, they use their political clout use their political clout  Would this be illegal? So here's the website or the Twitter feed saved you a click  The Wall Street Journal coke launches first new flavor in over a decade  Saved you a click says orange vanilla because that's all you really want to know from that story. So is that a snippet? Yes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem in the German laws they never defined snippet  They probably haven't defined haven't seen here yet  What they define is there's not a magic number of words same as fair comment  There is no definition of fair comment because it depends upon them reproducing more than single words are very short extracts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we don't know what very short means don't know what very short is  So actually what Google's doing could actually be a very short X. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you'll get to a search and you'll have no idea what you're looking at  I'm trying to find the thing that Google put up about two weeks ago trying to show what it would look like  But I can't find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, all right, I mean this seems kind of dumb but we've also  Here we go here on fire over GDPR and other things and  They've kind of not been a bad thing. Maybe this will be a good thing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get me started on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo why are you poking the bear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And honestly while you could make I mean there's no privacy  Purpose for this this doesn't benefit end users at all effective anything at disadvantages end users  Exactly. This is clearly  To the bottom of the link. I just put up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see Google put up something that show I can't find never mind. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what about 13 at the risk of getting bogged down in one of these let's go to the next one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 13, which is really a problem as well  So 13, where are you miss Rada?  Is  Gonna screw you Leo  If you ever quote anything in audio or video  It requires commercial sites to buy licenses to anything that users may possibly upload

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Until we get like microtransactions, then it might be you know doable, but this is not I mean that's  You can even set up a bureau for that if you are a publication  Like even if I wanted to pay you ten cents to quote you so we would lose so I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that sounds like  Okay in in our case. No one could listen to our shows in the EU

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right because if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quote something we'd be uploading  in a podcast  We just did it a bunch of times content from other people's sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're showing them talking about all from me EU publications, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By licenses for anything that you just can't visit Paris anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll get arrested. So am I correct? Is that a correct interpretation if this passes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do whole shows where we don't actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show anything, but I don't want a chilling effect. I mean already in this show exactly  We're 15 minutes in and I've showed John Gruber's website. Yep. I've showed the Wall Street Journal. I've showed  people's Twitter feeds and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With every show that we publish we publish a list of all the links all the stories  We we referred to all that's the show knows like 20 stories in every episode that we you can you can publish the link alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what what's the link text? We can't put any text next to it if it's a snippet or an extract  Surely could put the headline I could put we could put a description of what the link leads to I don't think that well  We don't know but I'm more concerned  So because I'm okay so I'm showing John Gruber's website this is copyrighted material in the United States  Is it only material that's copyrighted in the EU?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a good question. But the next piece is let's say somebody in your chat room Leo. It's your chat room  Puts up a big block quote from something happens all the time. You're liable. You're liable, right? That's a bigger shut off  Shut off chat. Sorry, chatters. Bye  So the upshot of this by the way, how does Julia say this is gonna pass? Oh, yeah  I said no, I mean she's calling bat signals. This is sopa people time across Europe. This is fight at time  So she's trying to she's trying to fight hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To get she writes the history of this law is a shameful one for the very big from the very beginning  The purpose of articles 11 and 13 was never to solve clearly defined issues in copyright law  With well-assessed measures, but to serve powerful special interests  I think you can argue that pretty much all the copyright laws in all the world are to serve special interests  But all right with hardly any concern for the collateral damage caused  The collateral damage in this case would be I would have to turn off  I would have to look at you when you come into the chat room and block you if you're in the EU, right?  I mean can I this doesn't affect probably probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you or you would have to to tell all of us we can't show anything  I'm not gonna do that for anyone. I'm not gonna do that. We can't do that. That would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a chilling effect that I'm not willing to accept. So now imagine you are a European Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The classy cultured Leo Laporte the one with a beret true to his French name  So so so so your cousin  Leon Laporte  Is doing a podcast in France  Is doing a podcast in France  How does he operate he has to say I can do nothing but make my own stuff  I can't quote anyone. I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show anything. Well, you could presumably do as you pointed out a lot of what we do, which is did you see this?  And here's a problem, I mean we could talk about story  It's actually sad because one of the things I try to do when we talk about a story is refer to  The sourcing reporter and and and publication  So we would have to just stop doing that we'd have to just so I start a rant against something and stacy says no jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're wrong. You're you're you're saying the wrong thing. Let me quote what that person actually says leo says shut up stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, well it in one sense it would make you do a lot of reporting  I mean as a old school journalist who actually had to call people as opposed to just like lift stuff from press releases and  twitter accounts you just be like  Hello, I mean it'd be a pain in the butt. Well, that's but everything individually everything would have to be doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reportage based and uh, that means it eliminates commentary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eliminates commentary and it eliminates fact-checking look at it that way  I want to quote this thing and say why it's wrong. I can't quote what i'm snopes doesn't work in that snopes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, we know snopes is fake news now, so it's okay  Um, so here's an example friends  We've been we've been quoting julio rada and her blog we couldn't do that anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is so patly against any

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So would that also turn people who write stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I even wear a beret is that even allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What wait if I did reporting would I have to open a licensing division to like let people quote my stuff  No, that would be hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, yes, it would be and in fact if you're julio rada, you want us to quote you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you wouldn't get you'd lose all this traffic all this it puts stacey on iot out of business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Now keeps springer in business. Let's be clear. This is only in the eu  So the the defense for americans and other countries is just say well as as as by the way many newspapers already do with gdpr  You're just blocking you readers listeners  They can't come in the chat room as as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Various publishers blocked eu readers because of gdpr would we get thousands would we get sued?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By somebody in the eu for doing this in the united states

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  If we're visible to somebody in the eu, yes, so we just have to work very hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To keep people from the in the eu from seeing our forbidden content. Yeah, obviously we're taking this to the extreme but but but this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an extreme measure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes chops in the chat room. This all feels like an overreaction as if the eu hasn't considered all these possibilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry  Me no  Uh, yeah, and they've and they've done it and julio rada and others have been fighting hard and they won  and then  the powerful lobbyists of publishing and hollywood the version of european come back  Uh, and uh, the news publishers go for 11 and the entertainment people go for 13  And uh, we're back in with soap of people and here's what your google news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would look like if article 11 passes  No pictures  No text just a link just a link to the liverpool echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those of you listening, it just has a blank box on liverpool echo four hours ago. That's all it says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't say what's in it doesn't say why you should go there doesn't say anything because they can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's ridiculous search too, this is google news search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  so  We should just ignore this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, everybody if you know anybody in europe have them right to their yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Legislators right now you need everybody listening. We have 30 percent of our audience is overseas if you're  I've run into people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And countries around the world who because of the show who recognized me on the street in munich

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, uh, please if you are in the eu, right your  Representatives and say and point out to them. Maybe they haven't considered the impact of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can look up your representative's voting behavior at save your internet.eu  EU

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I have to say this is a trend global trend also this is not restricted to the eu  This is what you know, the big copyright holders would like they think I don't think they they realize the consequences of this  Otherwise, they wouldn't like it. But uh, you know, and this is what corrie doctorow and others have been invading against the world intellectual property organization  um, which and the dmca which undermined, uh,  Uh all of those fair use there's no fair use in the dmca. Fortunately nobody seems to have enforced it  But it's still bad policy to pass laws as hoping nobody will enforce them  so  Um, go ahead. Thank you for allowing me to do the uh, no, this is a this is hair on fire or beret on fire in my case  So at some point  You're gonna have mass disobedience  That's what happened. Yeah, when laws get passed that are untenable people just don't obey them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hank green did a great video  Explained to all their listeners why what viewers why his brother john's video about I think it was european football was taken down  And he went through the whole process very good explainer video. I'll find it and send it to you  Uh about how the process works now with youtube and he says, you know, it basically kind of works  But we all violate the law  And the and he says that it's in the interest of those we violate against to keep it up and get money from it  And to get promotion from it and we all know this and so nobody's really following the law and it's all absurd because the law is absurd

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, was that was very funny if hank did a takedown against you? Yeah for complaining about copyright video. Yeah here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's uh, it was a blatant violation of copyright. I just stole it but somehow  That's okay, we live in a brave new copyright world and the solutions really aren't legal anymore  They're technological so for the people out there who are making content and are confused about copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the bizarre state of intellectual property. Okay, i'll just leave this as an exercise for the viewer or listener  Yes, exactly, but it's very good. It's excellent. But it's uh on youtube the bizarre state of copyright  um  Cool  I kind of blame jay frank for the state the bizarre state of youtube video

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  incidentally  Jump cuts it was it was ze frank who many many years ago  Oh, yeah started this whole thing of never waking and then just random cuts in your  video  And clearly hank was heavily influenced by ze frank  Everyone was everyone was except me  We were talking earlier before the before the show to 20 minutes we could kind of wait out  We we were talking before the show about different styles of podcasting and video casting and stuff and how  Mine is influenced pretty much by just live radio  Because that's where this really is a live radio show and how in consonant that is with the trendy  You know npr style that the gimlet espouses or the youtube styles  There are various youtube styles, but they're all kind of oh adept to ze frank. Were you to try a different style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't even know how to start  I mean, I mean that's technically I know what to do. We can technically do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  We spain did the link tax  Hurt the publishers. It was meant to help  It's corporate protectionism every single I mean I did a presentation and i'm not going to bore you with it now  But but I went through every single one of the major pieces of european regulation and everyone had an unintended consequence which in the end  Gives the platform is more power. Yeah, I mean even even google and facebook as much as this would hurt them  Um, they're in better shape to weather it than anybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing I mean the people who really get hurt are the  Small podcasters bloggers. Oh, yeah, the jog groupers of the world the twits of the world. Those are the people  We just would have to turn off  Our european faucet. I don't want to do that  Nope  What if we do now? I know stacey. You don't think much of ben longstaff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay  Yeah, let's talk about this dude. That was a that was a little uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  solte voce warning there, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if we do what ben says and just say no, we're not going to pay your fines  Uh, he says google could just say we'll turn off service to the eu  um  I I don't want to turn off service to the podcast to the eu  What if I just say no i'm not going to pay your fine and go come and get me  Could they come and get me?  Um, could the european police break into our studios and drag me off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean they would have to file. I mean the process of arresting you would be boom. They're going to file  Charges against you they have to  Get an extradition. It's not it's civil though. It's not even criminal, right? It's civil

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they would have to sue me in court. I would I would not show up. They'd find me in absentia  They'd say we want we want a billion dollars in a billion euros from you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, so you go on your next river cruise with your charming wonderful wife. Yeah. No, what happens when you land there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I'd be a cause celeb  I wear my beret. They take me I go like this take me to jail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  French will complain that you made fun of them. Then you're now you're really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is his name? He wears who is he pretending to be?  So they're actually he's uh  Longstreet says  That france is actually trying to reduce a tax  Just for google apple facebook and amazon a gaffa tax  um  Now I guess google could walk away from a country. They don't want to they walked away from china. No, they're sure they don't want to no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and they walked away from china because of being asked to censor which is against its principles, right?  Walking away because I mean I guess if google wants to plainly state for everyone that collecting people's data  Forever and keeping it for whatever it wants to use it for is one of their principles, which it is  Then you know that would be a reason to what?  away from it is  it is clearly  one of their  economically his own detritus  What if  I I am just saying that it is they do want to collect information about people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to collect information about people unlike mass media. They want to serve people as individuals. We can disagree about their motives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fine. But what if the eu at some point decides to find google the maximum that they can find them  Which is good google says I will leave i'm not giving you four billion dollars, dude

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That if they shut down google well look at ask cashmere hill  I mean if you really got tough and google shut down for a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wouldn't be good. It actually would be good worse in france than it is here in the united states french

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not how a company wants to behave. I mean because google is  France is still a democratic institution. So if google were to like basically take all its toys and go home  Yes, people would be sad and say to their government. How dare you do that to google?  But the rest of us would look at google and be like dude. That was a jerk move  You should probably negotiate over this. No, no, no, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we'd wave flags and say bravo google if france find google the full four percent of their annual revenue  Which would be 4.4 billion dollars for a gdpr violation and google said  Google said we're not going to pay it. It's we only make 2.2 billion a year from france in advertising revenue  We'll just say fine. We turn you off. You don't like it  We'll we'll turn you off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a law that was passed by several. I don't know how many countries are now in the eu  um it represents I mean this this is one fewer company  a company yeah a company cannot  Flout the rules dem of a democratically elected society and pretend to be not okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I know let's say they don't flout. Let's say they say all right  We're going to give you four and a half billion, but bye. Bye. That's not flouting. That's paying the fine  And then saying we're not going to do business here anymore  What if they did because of your because of your law because of your law because then that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine. But for good they can also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they pay the fine they can afford it. They pay the fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to follow the laws of countries. I agree that are not evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I agree so that's what we're talking about right now with something that's about to become a law that is really untenable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I I know you would I mean, I don't I don't like it  But well, it's just not the right it's just not the right way to to to pursue your goals  If I mean the idea that google would go straight to being like, eh, it's not worth it. You don't generate google  Of course would fight it in court. That's the way these yes, that's what's happening right now with rules  Yeah, that's what's happening right now  So to just like to basically say screw you in the process of law that we've all lived under for you know  The last 150 years would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a dickish move. No, no, you're absolutely right  So they fight in court if they lose in court, they pay the fine and then they say but i'm sorry  We're not going to pay it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So goodbye that's that's then they're left only in the eu in the uk when it's left the eu  But then they leave the uk because of the cairncross review  Which is going which?  The government should tell google and facebook to correct  Things on their platforms, yeah, so ultimately it's a shrinking world if you start leaving

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not a lot of places. In fact the u.s. I mean you just mentioned uh, gavin newsome and the california privacy law  They might have to leave state by state

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say it stacy stacy get ready i'm gonna say it  Hey, it's more  Oral panic happening. So what's this? So there's there's this constant  Uh, oh my god, the internet is ruining everything and it's bs. I'll i'll i'll tell you though jeff. It's a mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To conflate gdpr with articles 1113. You should it's a because uh, I think it's appropriate to ask for privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and so I think it's just bad. I think it's a well-intentioned  Badly written law. It's gdpr  11 and 13 are ill intentioned and horribly written law

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think you should make the fight have the fight on two fronts because you that's going to be tough

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think jeff conflating the internet with the giant companies that currently dominate the internet is probably a conflation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should avoid too. Well except stacy. I'm prevented as a blogger from doing what i've done since 2001  So i'm the internet and no, but that's why I say don't mix don't mix this new copyright law with gdpr

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gdpr companies like mine  Can can adhere to can continue to do our business we're not surveillance based  And so gdpr is not a problem for a lot of the internet. I can criticize both laws  Yeah, but but but it'd be miss be careful them together. Yeah, because if you lump it because on the other hand  This new copyright law would put all of us out of business in the eu  It would put my show out of business. It would put your show out of business and put your blog out of business  Or we would have to be something very different. So yes, there's harm to google there, too  But there's also harm that I think stacy would be fair to say that law is anti-internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah, i'm not we're not talking about that law. Yeah gdpr is different what this dude is talking about when he's saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not no, but but that same issue is going to come up in other contexts, too  I mean at this point what you have is if these if these laws get passed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  then you know again there  Are processes that we generally follow when we disagree with democratically created laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not come to civil disobedience yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah in civil disobedience by companies. I look heavily at scan set  They're not in it to make our country or our laws better. They're in it for themselves stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So people also lots of countries put up black pages on their websites  And kind of shut off their content for a day as a protest did you you didn't object to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't object to that and that that was a one-day thing that was  that was  Not shutting that's not saying i'm taking all my toys and going home  That is an example before a law is even passed to say hey, this is what it's going to look like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I agree. I think google will act as an adult not as oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will not as a child, but I wouldn't I I think in in the privacy of their of their wonderful cafeteria  I think they're due some childish stomping their feet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well heck I do that at after the show jeff sometimes i'm like  And i'm sure you're like, oh stacy don't you recognize that free speech is important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what I love about the free and open web and that's why I really like like you jeff. I  I just it hurts me literally physically pains me when people threaten this because it's been such an amazing  Democratizing force and I know there's bad stuff, but that's the world  Uh, the internet is we can't ever forget how what an incredible transformation the internet  Amen brother made to the limit. Yeah, and and the free and open web is really what it's all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh jeff that you should have a shirt that says the open web is my religion  That is what you need. That's true  I'll wear that shirt. See a lot of people just like I already have what does his shirt say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dissent is patriotic. That is true as well. That is also true

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big size, I know i'm like sitting here going where is my drink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know a drink and a donut if you were here you could have a drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I I can I can text down and get a drink. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could text you could text for beverages and a donut

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, I can't text for a donut that  Drinks and a donut on the way up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be awesome  Uh, what do you what do you jeff you started this? What else do you want to start that? So stacy you can you pick the next one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just looking through trying to think what else I wanted to talk about here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like google fiber, but there's not a lot really to discuss there. Oh, I know what I want from you stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I know what I want you to talk about. Oh my goodness. Tell me tell me tell me  amazon by an arrow  Oh euro. Yes thing about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a big story put it in the show notes are you a thumbs up or thumbs down on that now we should say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hero was a sponsor  And I use the past tense they still are in theory, but every time amazon buys one of our sponsors  They they seem to lose disappear podcasts  Uh, and to my knowledge amazon's never bought podcast advertising  Uh audible was the first and uh, I think they still do some podcast advertising but not on our network  Ring  Same thing they've paid a billion dollars for and we don't know how much they paid for euro euro  If you don't remember is the mesh networking solution. We all like a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have them they're running right now. Yeah, they're great. Me too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I've stalled them at my mom's too because I can manage your network from here  So the concern some people raise is that well now amazon just going to use this as one more way to spy on us for instance  Well, but wait jeff your euro knows every device in your house that's connected to the internet by name and mac address

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and because it's a router it also knows exactly where you are on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  It knows when people come and go because they join the router or they leave the router  So it knows when you get home knows when your kids get home knows when you leave the house  Knows when you're naughty and nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It knows sort of does know how your devices communicate to the internet and where they communicate to  So i'll show I mean like if I go into my euro app I can see for example right now  Um, what do I see? Oh, I can see everybody's in my house, but I can also see  Um, sorry, i'm looking at my devices and  I can see which ones are idle and which are communicating. Yeah  right now like  Dude, for some reason my sink is talking to the internet. I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's uh interesting information that you know, certainly amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like sink. What the heck actually if I see that for enough time. I'm like, hey, that's weird behavior for my sink  I need to investigate like  You know, I have euro plus i can think she's coming by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have euro plus two that's the 99 dollar a year add-on that gives you a lot of features well worth it. I think  um  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So fine so there's the i'm just gonna say there's the there's the paranoid rant about the big company but in terms of  Uh of functionality or benefit. Oh, there's lots lots of synergy too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Well hold on. Let's let's hold the phone because jeff you did ask me my opinion and i'm gonna give it to you  Yes, I did  This is a data story this is a data story in two different ways  One it's a story about how amazon has access to amazing data from what people are buying  And how successful those purchases are?  To make decisions about what it should buy  so that's  Data story number one amazon has access to data that a lot of times  People pay investment banks and consulting firms to find out in terms of market share and that sort of thing  And amazon even referenced eros 4.6 star rating in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their press release so that's hold on right there stacy. Just okay. Um, I agree. I agree. I'm just curious  What specifically in with presuming amazon is going to follow gdpr is going to follow privacy things. What does it learn?  Uh that it didn't know already because you buy everything you buy from amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, that's not nefarious. I say this is this is genius  This is one of those this is a this is a point in amazon's favor  I'm just pointing it out because a lot of people and this is actually how amazon has worked for  Now I guess oh over a decade because with amazon  Web services it has done this for a while where it's like hey  What services are getting big on our platform?  What api calls are we seeing and it uses that to determine what sort of features it should launch next or if it should buy a company?  so  Just by virtue of being a platform of its size amazon gets a lot of competitive information about other companies  And I don't think people understand how that helps it be successful, but this is a really good example of how that helps  So that's one side  The second data sharing thing is by buying ero. It does get access to a lot of information  about devices on a person's network where a person goes on the network and  As any router would as as any router would and I want to be clear and ero has a in my opinion very clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in my opinion very good privacy policy was absolutely something I read before I bought an ero  And everybody should read that and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the question important because they had the all this added functionality, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so here's where we should get really clear about what we're talking about and what's scary because I I think it's really important  amazon his first or ero has first off said okay  Our existing privacy policy stays the same  So we do collect information about what devices are on your network and we use that information in aggregate and anonymized  To talk about things so in some ways that's good for amazon because it gets even even if I don't buy devices from amazon  amazon gets that same insight into devices that are hot  By virtue of seeing the percentage of them out in the wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's good for amazon's future business goals. Oh, they know what's hooked into your wi-fi what you use most, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so even if I didn't buy it from them, so that's interesting. The other thing is amazon says  In all of its data gathering activities about like my smart light bulbs and whatnot because i'm sure you guys saw the bloomberg story  Where it's asking smart device vendors to basically share information about when things are turned off and on and when they're used  Even if they're not being activated through the echo  So people got up in arms about that  I am kind of neutral about that and i'll say why  Amazon is not using this for advertising. They're very clear about that. They may one day and that would be a problem  but  Today they use it to provide context and build algorithms that can anticipate your wants and needs  Which is what everyone says they want from a smart home  and I think here's where we get into a core issue that I think is going to be  We're talking about privacy right now. Like it's the defining issue of the current era  I think what the real defining issue is going to be is trust in transparency  Because these companies do have this data  And if they use that data to make better products or to do things for you a lot of people are okay giving that data up  If they use that data to like manipulate you into buying crap, you don't need people are going to be rightly pissed about it  so  I wanted I wanted to make those subtleties clear because I have a problem with certain kinds of data sharing but not with others  And so I don't want you to just to shout techno panic at me, jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I got no, you're right. I'm right. You're right. The issue the issue is also i'm good. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just say you know people say well what euro knew this  Why do you care that amazon now knows this the issue is not so much that euro knows it is that amazon can collect a bigger  And bigger pile of data about you and by connecting the dots  In the variety of data it has about you it really knows  Perhaps more than you even realize  About you and what you're up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it does and  as it starts launching things like a health service and  What i'm really interested in is as these mon these companies establish these huge data troves  Where are the firewalls between different data things and what's what aspects of what data stores are getting shared with what partners?  because I think that's  I don't want my health insurance company knowing if I have like a connected medical device that  My doctor hasn't prescribed or maybe that i'm not using a connected medical device that my doctor prescribed  I don't want that to go through my  Get out from my router  That's also owned by amazon to my insurance provider who is now contracted with amazon's new health division. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're also making me flash out a friend of mine who's a brilliant entrepreneur engineer here in jersey  Uh had a company some years ago that for a whole different reasons  was  tied into your electricity in your house and every appliance you use has a  Signature  Of its electric usage which is trackable so you can find out  Which brand of washing machine and how long it's on and so on and so forth  It's interesting that you you get into the full grid of the house  And no one's no one's threatening to do that yet  But it could be just plugging in your your echo could do that right if they wanted you can actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Detect  I mean there's mics in a lot of things now, right?  You can actually detect certain appliance brands and things like that just by the sound their motors make  So if you if you think about that  In kevin and I actually on this week's show we talk about  Some disclosures that we think need to start happening. I think and i'll tie this back to last week when we talked about nest secure  Basically disclosing to everybody suddenly that they had a microphone in there that you could opt into  Um to have the google the google assistant on it and everyone was like what?  But I think any device that comes with a microphone  Or a camera that should be disclosed in the specs on the box  way up front  All kinds of sensors. Yes. Yes  Everything should be up front because I think it's important to understand if you're going to connect something  What might be activated because there's a lot of sensors in a lot of these products that aren't activated yet  And I don't think people are aware of that or you just don't see the data associated with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In all honesty, first of all, that's nice  But you have so many devices now in the typical home that there  You might as well just assume a perfect map is made already of your presence your things you use the devices you own  I mean, I I think that that's you can you can fairly safely whether it says it on the box assume that there's enough devices and  Certainly your home stacey in my home  That a pretty perfect picture already exists  And I'm actually not worried about what they've done with it up to this point  I'm very worried though about once this data is aggregated what could be done  and and it it it involves kind of envisioning  a dystopian future

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is the panopticon but I worry that we're giving you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is once if it happens is too late that we that so we're giving him that I don't I agree with jeff in the  Sense that I get benefits from it and i'm i'm not worried that amazon knows what kind of washing machine I have  I don't I don't I don't see the harm in that  But I do worry  well, for instance if you have an ear if you have an ear and your  Mistress has an ear and you go to her house at a certain time of day and certain time of night  That that information is recorded by the ear on could be could be aggregated it's the aggregation that's a problem  And and and at that point what is amazon going to bust me? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I just I but but is it is it it could be?  Sought by authorities could you could your wife's lawyer get that there you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, possibly and it's not a defense to say well then don't do do anything wrong. That's not that's not what we're talking about  Yeah  I don't see it at immediate harm  And this is what I always challenged people to like to vorac would always where he was worrying about this 10 years ago  I said, well, what are you worried about? He said well the insurance company is going to know you're eating a donut and raise your rates  Those are to me almost a minimus partly because the insurance company  Isn't going to raise your rates. They're just going to deny you coverage  They ask you this already at the beginning and if you lie about it  And then have a claim well now they can just say well, we're not going to give you any money  So it's it's not information insurance companies don't already kind of have and collect it  I'm much more worried about this kind of and and I can't put my finger on it  but but a sort of negative future where  All of this information about you is there. I don't know. Is there what is the what is the vision of harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what I mean, so there's there's a couple things here and I  I'm just going to tout my show left and right because I had a lawyer on last week's show was what happens when your smart home  Is issued with a subpoena and we talked about  Harms, there's two issues one  Is data discrimination so any sort of behavior that's derived from this data?  It's hard to prove harm because that harm could come way down the road. That's what the other thing is  It is also hard to prove harm because we don't know how the data  influences these algorithms currently a decision could be made about your health insurance cost based on  Something as esoteric as how many times you open your bathroom door. That's right  And you will never know that the bathroom door is  Why that happened? Right? And also because of that we don't actually  Judge there there there's not enough scientific actuarial data to say hey that bathroom door is a totally reliable indicator of something, right?  so  There's a lot of stuff. We don't know  There's a lot of stuff that's unproven, but it's just assumed to be correct kind of like the 10 000 steps number  that that came from a japanese study that is not like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitive or health right turns out there's a lot of stuff like that  Yeah, it's basically made up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we when we hear the word data our brain shuts off and it says oh, it's a fact. It's good  so  Those are the kind of issues around harm and I would say  You may  The fact is we'll never know unless like intrepid reporters go out and look at things like I mean look at the people  I don't know if you remember actually someone in the chat room is pointing out a story about  cpap machines that insurers that were connected in  Doctors were sharing data from those connected cpap machines with insurers and the insurers were using that data to deny people coverage  For that expensive machine based on whether or not they were using it  And some other subtleties that i'm not going to get into  That that is a real harm  so  I mean  There are actual harms out there that are existing right now. Can I turn this around? Can I turn this around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And ask what do you think?  uh  Amazon's plans are to use this  For products and what benefits could accrue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think amazon's big plan for this is what it states which is it wants to understand how people use the home to make  The echo a lot easier to use and to do some cool anticipatory things  so  I think that's amazon's goal here. I think we'll also use the data that it has gathered in its own decision making process

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not just the data if you tied together because I think somebody said they were disappointed that the echo isn't a uh a mesh  A mesh outter so right. Yeah, if you tied together these various technologies  Uh and designed it now what if you're amazon, what would that look like and tell me it's not a fire phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a fire phone. Um, no, it would be amazon's failed product. Yeah  No, I mean you it would not be difficult to say oh hey, let's just pop a router into every smart speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I want our smart speaker in every router. Yes. I mean yes, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The challenge is that would raise the price. I mean the dot is the best-selling one and the reason why is it's cheap, right?  um  so, you know you also have to think about your if you add the hardware associated and brains associated with today's mesh routers you would  you would blow the price of your  Echos out of the water. So that's what they google if you took the go ahead. Sorry  Google's had this technology. They've had both a smart home hub and a mesh router for a while and they have yet to consolidate them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right  So imagine if you if you in your new home in seattle, you haven't bought one yet, right? Are you gonna build one or i'm going to rent  You're gonna rent it first, right? So so then you find your perfect spot your perfect lot and you're gonna build the ultimate stacey house  spelled h a u s  and  um  in every room  There's a box. Maybe it's a remade electric plug. Maybe it's a rethought  Um intercom switch like we used to have right something it's a box right and it can have incredible functionality in it  Right. So what all could be in that in a in your rethought home? It could be it could be a router in every room  It could be an echo in every room. It could be  um  What else what what is what is what is that? If you're amazon and thinking five years down, what does that look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it'd be awesome to have that stuff in the walls  But I changed my mind because i'm gonna want to upgrade my router, right? I was like, oh you just pop it in the light switch  There's power. There's everything. It's perfect. Then I was like no  No, I do not want to rip my light switches out every two to three years when wi-fi alliance changes the wi-fi standard  so I think there's going to be an external box that functions as a  A access point or whatnot. Maybe it's just plugged into the wall  I also think that you're going to see a lot of other devices act as access points and they'll just be  Higher end devices not the cheap stuff. So it's not going to be in your 20-dollar wisecam. It's going to be in your  You know fancy sonos speakers  We already see this in linar and kb homes or building homes that basically have a  You know, you've got your your electrical cabinet and then you have your iot cabinet and in that cabinet you see  You everything's wired up. You've got a fancy router. You've got  Your various hubs that you still need to have for functionality of certain systems and then you know, you have  Echoes throughout the home is the control medium or in the case of kb. It's google  And so I think that's going to be the model for a while  I think we will start seeing things built into the wall. Like my new house will have smart switches already in the wall, right?  I would love to see  Actually air quality monitors in my wall for everything. I would build my hvac system  to  Heat and cool certain rooms like so having actual  ducks that can  I was like turn off and on that's that's the gesture i'm making here  For individual cooling and heating of different rooms  Let's see  I would love  I would love to have  Presence detection in my room in my house, but I don't want the presence detection to be  sent out to the cloud or another service and I think  We've we've kind of gone past that and you're gonna hate me, but I am reading  Shoshana's shoshana's of us about what's your book?  It's an excellent book. Yeah, and the technology and and I know jeff you're gonna roll your eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't agree with everything but it's called surveillance capitalism in it. She was a guest on triangulation triangulation is  Her basic tenet is that?  At this point. It's gotten to the point where these guys are gonna have so much information  they can not only predict your behavior, but influence it and  Ultimately, that's the the harm to to both personal science and the social science  To both personal sovereignty  and democracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it doesn't have to be that way. I mean that that's the thing I took most away from this is we take a lot of this  This data sharing and aggregation as a matter of fact, but it doesn't actually have to be that way  We could actually buy systems and you'll see in my recommendation  That don't actually go out to the cloud. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that's what's gonna happen. There was you know, what I think renee richey said it's a shame  He was really hoping that apple would buy euro  Would that have been a better outcome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I you know the fact that apple left the field just as well actually a couple years before wi-fi started getting hard  Was inexplicable to me. I really thought  I really thought that they would use their airport router as a as a way into this  Opportunity didn't they yeah, and they just they didn't do it and it was so weird to me. Yeah, so weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then of course his point would be that we trust apple  And so apple could reasonably own euro do all these wonderful things, but we wouldn't have to worry about our privacy  I think that may be the way forward which is there will be some companies that will disinter that will break the chain

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't trust apple in the smart home in the sense that I don't trust apple  To support a given product over a 10-year lifespan that I might expect. We know that but they're better than google in that regard  I will say that i'm like, oh, you know apple you're just if I put this into my house now i'm locked in you're  Going to screw me over every few years with some weird change and I don't want to think about my house that much  That's the only thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will grant you that that is yeah  That is a potential issue, but I think they might have been a better steward of our privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah  That's because they can make their money. They're not everybody thinks they're so virtuous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, let's be clear. They couldn't succeed in the ad business. So they didn't have a use for the data  So they've turned the bug into a feature, but that's good. Now that's happened. They're trying to rip off  journalists like crazy right now. Oh, we'll get let's do that story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry  So this is rumor not fact  But the wall street journal and others are saying that apple is asking the apple as you know has an apple news  It's free right now to apple users, but they're apparently looking at at least two new subscription  Services one is a tv service and one is a news service  They bought texture another one of our fine sponsors that got acquired by a big company  They bought texture and texture was started by we should point out  By hearst condi and I think some others  I'm married when it still was made rest in peace. The idea was uh, we're going to own our destiny and digital  We'll have a service that you subscribe to we'll distribute the money  Uh, and uh, and that way people will still get magazines  Um, and so texture and I love texture. I thought it was a great service  I'm actually very sad that it looks like the end is near  apple bought it but now the the wall street journal says apple is going back to those publishers because by the way  The acquisition of texture did not mean that they acquired the same rights that texture had  Uh, so they have to renegotiate all these deals. They're going back to publishers and the rumor is and I I credit it  Because obviously these publishers are getting offered these deals and going to the journal and saying you won't believe what what apple's has said  They want 50 percent and no subscriber data will be passed along

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think as opposed to let me just add here  um  Facebook which sends people I believe I could get this wrong, but I think facebook sends  Uh helps helps publications find out who's going to subscribe and sends them to them and takes nothing  And google which has said that they're going to take only uh enough to cover their bare costs and that's next to nothing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, uh, if that's the case  Is that too much to ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so  I think especially at this time when um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they bring them twice as much traffic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well same argument that google makes the argument they'll make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's plan apparently is to charge end users 10 bucks a month  And then to divvy up that the 50 percent of keep 50 and divvy up the other 50  Percent among the publishers based on the amount of time. I think this is really interesting the amount of time users spend reading  So it'll be directly and you know connected to the amount of time they spend reading that content. So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  There's a few issues with this  And I just wrote a post this week, but I called the the the the you showed it earlier the scorched earth  uh, and I don't make myself popular with some folks might I think we've hit the  the  We're very near the end of how many paywalls we can have on earth  They're not going to work. Um  but  Uh, there's there's there's an issue. I would agree with you by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I notice and i'm sure our audience also notices that you know now that we hit so many of them  I'm you know, i'm saying okay bloomberg i'll take my nine articles and keep keep moving  I'm not exactly i'm not going to pay for it and I've seen there's publications

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I choose never to link on in case I need that one article, right?  um  My son lives in boston. I'm interested in boston.com occasionally, but I  When I hit the the limit, okay, no big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, even worse there are a lot of paywalls. You can't even read the content at all  right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was talking to some publishers just today  Yeah, right I was talking to some publishers just today and and I said  Somebody comes and they hit a paywall  And that's a potential customer. It's the worst thing you can do to them. You lose them anyway  The apple thing which is the same argument I have against micro payments  Which everybody thinks is going to be the messiah that suddenly saves everything  I've had 25 companies come to me saying i've got it micro payments. It's going to save everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny. We've been saying that for 20 years at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But part of the problem here is that if you are the wall street journal and if you charge, uh,  Six eight hundred dollars a year  and if I can now get articles from the wall street journal on apple for  You know pennies literally  Um potentially that hurts the wall street journal badly  And and so it it skews the value  Uh in a way that could be additionally harmful. So not only do publishers get pennies. They only get half the pennies  So we'll see  I also wrote as I saw that story. I wrote to somebody at a big company and it's more than a small company  I said opportunity for you undercut apple which will have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and apple may also back down. I mean this is yeah, I think they will like it's a trial balloon  They're also trying to put together a tv deal and the journal reports that netflix has already said under no circumstances  And uh, and hbo is saying they don't have hbo yet either. So  Apple this is apple by the way has had this happen from day one  The music industry didn't like them  iTunes eventually had so much clout they had to deal with them  Right, but this is this, you know, they've been trying to put together tv deals according to reports for years  So it'll be that's it is an interesting  Issue  What do you think about cashmere's hills attempt to block the big five

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man, I thought that was so  almost heroic  painful  Man, yeah, I was like good lord. This person like dragged herself over broken glass to basically do her job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well bravo. She's an excellent reporter. Yeah bravo. She is  And she's been on our shows before we love her  Because this is a really interesting question  Okay, if you don't like the data collection of amazon facebook google microsoft and apple, can you use the internet without them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She the answer is basically no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She couldn't listen to music in her car because her car had ford's sync in it which was based on microsoft's  car platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She could listen to the radio. She did say that she was listening to npr. She had to listen to the radio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's  Which I have not done in years savage now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did have I did have a problem a little bit with her her experiments parameters. So like deciding that  In not supporting amazon you couldn't deal with companies that were hosted on aws

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, if there were if if you hated amazon and wanted to give them no money  or data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but you could not boycott something as large as tyson food for example today unless you wanted to grow your own  Right. So so there are other industries where companies are just as large and we just don't see them or like let's say you hated the um  What is it uu line or the coke brothers? I mean, it's hard to boycott their stuff because they're everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't buy bounty paper towels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do like the selective size

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't remember if that's is it brawny. I can't remember which there's are but bounty or brawny. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, the point here is  I found that's interesting you of all people I would have thought you would pay attention to that kind of thing and not  And not buy those products  So you don't bother you don't try

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's too hard. It's too hard  It's it is way too much mental energy I know well she chose to use for instance proton mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which has its own servers deep within the mountains of sits eland  um, and I use you remember I got that helm  Which is my own server my own hard drive. I keep all my data away from google by doing that but helm  Routes all my server through a for aws instances  So even though it's encrypted now, here's a question. It's encrypted  So they're they're not getting access to any information for me not even metadata. It's completely encrypted going through there  They're uh, they're just using their ip address, but I guess indirectly i'm giving them money  So is is  I guess I mean, I know cashmere would not have used it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean yeah aws is is  It's a lot of the internet it's everywhere. Yeah, but it's also actually you couldn't watch twitter

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right, well, let's see you could watch twitter because it goes through cashfly, but  Uh our website is uh goes through aws. So you couldn't use twitter. You couldn't go to the website  Uh, I don't know which podcast apps use aws, but I bet a lot of them do how do you even find out?  She had a custom designed router that blocked anything with an amazon  Web services address so she just it wouldn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I I kind of wonder if like the experiment and that that aspect of it was kind of too free force  Like that's the only way well, that's kind of the only way you could yeah, you have to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She first tried to advertise her if you had an average, you know  If you've given the site had used a happened to come across a programmatic advertiser that used either google or aws  She watched that too. So anything involved. Oh man. Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She couldn't use she couldn't use dropbox dropbox because it's hosted a day  She couldn't use duck duck go because it's hosted on aws  So basically she had no search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I take your point more stacy now. I I see your point better because what because it kind of stacks the deck  In the narrative that they've taken over the world  of a little bit yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it also I mean and she may have had to choose that because she was using a pretty blunt instrument to avoid it  So she probably should have said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know there is a there I think about people who try to use laptops  people in the free software foundation who try to use only free software not free by no cost but  Liberty liberty free and it's very hard to do and most like almost all the linux laptops out there have  You know proprietary software or chips, you know have intel chips or chips with microsoft's  Uh  Trusted uh platform on there and there's all sorts of issues  It becomes very difficult. She ended up using a purism laptop. That's kind of designed  This is this is almost  One of the things she illustrates is you have to be fairly privileged to not use these services. Yeah, you have to buy  expensive new laptop  You know she had bought a nokia phone because she couldn't use android or ios  So she's using a a feature phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well in some of the I mean  So yes, so there there's that aspect and I in the real world  So you line the boxes company they if you if you have ever  If you've ever got a small business, you've gotten the uline catalog with shipping materials and all this  Every small business and many large businesses buy things that are shipped in their boxes and shipped using their gear  And to me, that's what aws is and people hate you line because those guys are actually  Yeah, but those guys are huge supporters of  Crazy right-wing republicans. So there's a lot of people who are like I want to boycott this in the can  so  That's how I feel like aws is and are you this is why she did this is why it's good. She did the experiment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She she proved that point  So  I think it's probably good that she tried to be 100 pure because it became really clear how hard that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting way to turn it around to the story we're talking about before so imagine if either amazon or google said  Fu europe and literally pulled out every service  Yeah, it's not just oh, I can't search anymore. It's oh my god. Imagine all the things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wouldn't work. So this is the thing that's scary that gives these companies huge power

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Political power  Well, they're not doing a very good job of using it. I know  They're losing every battle maybe because they're not they're not being

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Firm enough being tough. Yeah. Yeah, but but of course if they do they're going to be accused of being countries of themselves  And all that and we shut them all down  It's it's early it's 1475 people we're lucky we haven't had a 30 years more yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just got the freaking bibles for come on. Yeah, jeez  We haven't even invented the title page  Meanwhile, the new york police department says google in ways have got to stop sharing our drunk driving checkpoints

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of understand their point of view on that. I do but I also think that if people ways don't do it  somebody else will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is this is exactly  Why we need a new way of talking and thinking about?  data sharing  around tech and it  this type of data sharing can advantage big people and small people and the ability to like  Aggregate and search out and then display easily all this crazy information just puts everyone on more even footing and that's really uncomfortable for a lot  Of organizations and people I love let me ask you another question. Okay. Oh, I just want let me say one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the response of helen witty the president of mothers against drunk driving  She said I don't care because people are that inebriated aren't really  checking their  Checking their ways to avoid the the the mustached cop. They're just good line  But I think she says if you're impaired you're not going to pay any attention to that information  She said in her experience drunk drivers coming through sobriety checkpoints were often very confused or unaware of what was happening  What's going on?  What's happening?  Where who are you?  And then other people complained about the image of the police officer on weights  I think that's a mustache. Yeah, that's friendly. It's a friendly cop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. No, is that is that a drunk? Is it always drunk driving or is it just a cop there popo in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't do it. Do you guys have no refusals?  What do you have those so on weekends in texas on certain like big game weekends or like  Thanksgiving there's there's checkpoints and there are no refusal checkpoints. So everyone has to  Breathe into a tube

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the way it works at least in petaluma  Actually, there there are some issues about do you buy checkpoints?  In theory, it's fine in petaluma the way it works  They they talk to you and if you seem inebriated then they may just as they would if they pulled you over ask you to  You know walk a straight line that kind of thing and ultimately if they think you're intoxicated  They might ask you to uh to submit but you can always refuse in california  Then they just take you to the station house and they  They drop blood  I like your reaction stacy  I think the photographer is done shooting your house. That's the sign  Um, but the reason I think we know who's boss  Yeah, the reason i'm not fine of the sobriety checkpoints at least in our area  Is most often who gets pulled over and stopped and eventually their car impounded is  illegal aliens  That in fact it it it nets far more  Undocumented undocumented people please. Yeah, I know you can't say illegal aliens  Undocumented uh visitors  Than it does a drunk drivers and and I see it's kind of sad you go by and you'll see all these cars  That have been impounded and these poor guys and gals really?  Yeah, they're they're they're  so  Um, anyway, that's there's another political thing to say  My my in-laws would say and good riddance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  So I got one for you stacy and leo, I think it's an interesting question so now you have um  Various parties going strong after the platform saying that they should eliminate  Uh the dens where anti-vaxxers breed. That is a really interesting question. So is that the job?  Is that the job of facebook?  To is god knows it's misinformation god knows it's harmful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, is it like shouting fire in a crowded theater except is it like shouting fire in a closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  System especially since we're having what measles outbreaks in the northwest exactly  These are horrid people are actually people kids are getting sick. Some are dying  Because of this is it is it facebook's job?  To do that. Wow, i'd say no  So you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking about sorry. I'm thinking about this. Uh, what what that takes a little fun out of it stacy  What do you think first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geez, we need hot takes stacy hot. Yeah, just yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Silly me trying to get a considered opinion here  Okay, so i'm thinking about it from a public health standpoint it is  obviously detrimental  to  Have these closed groups and it is easier to share them and spread them. It's unlike in physical meetings  So it's much easier. So is it closer to basically shouting fire in a crowded theater theater is the question we'd have to come up with  Does that make sense?  Because that would be the argument that I would use if I said you should shut it down and that line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Refers back to I don't know if it was a phoenix frankfurter a supreme court decision about free speech that limited free speech  Uh only to cases where it it doesn't it's all right to abridge free speech in a case where it endangers lives  Right and the example he gave was shouting fire in a crowded theater  so thank you if it endangered well, I maybe I didn't even need to give you that gloss but just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that was hell. I was like I did not I did not have the reference point in front of me to explain  All of that. So oh you were doing it. Yeah  So so that is that is the question is is it  That big of an endangerment for public welfare

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Justice that was justice holmes. I apologize  Let's give him credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so yes, so that's that's what i'm trying to think through jeff and and I don't so here's here's stacy what I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're if you're facebook and you face something similar in  um  The czech republic  right  What you're going to try what you're going to hope to say is government you tell me what to do if it's against the law  I'll do it if it's not  I'm i'm leaving it right because that's what we do. That's our policy here  um, so in essence  I think that's what we do  But we don't want the government I think to outlaw even the the the the first amendment protects  Lies the first amendment  Missed protects mistakes first amendment protects no actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And i'm reading an article it does not according to the washington post  Knowing knowingly false statements of fact are often constitutionally unprotected

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in instances of libel fraud perjury where there is other law or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oliver wender holmes saying the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in  Falsely, that's the important word there shouting fire in a theater and causing panic  So falsely is important if it's  If it's false and it causes  harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may not be constitutionally protected then then we end up in a case where  Do we want facebook and twitter?  to decide what's false and true  Do we want them to pre-moderate everything that we all want to say?  You know 11 and 13 were bad. This is worse in a lot of ways  Okay, so i'm not i'm not arguing with you. I think the anti-factors are awful, but I don't know what to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's maybe a way out of it or maybe a thing that could happen  Let's say my child gets the measles and as a result of it is  Deaf for the rest of her life and she was hearing and I view that as a harm. I could actually go after facebook if  I could because that is a tort situation where I could demonstrate harm if I could demonstrate it directly back to that group  Like say my best friend didn't vaccinate their child. That's who I got it from and it was because of that group  And I could find enough other people you could get a class action or you could get a significant enough lawsuit  That facebook would then have to act to protect its own economic interests to avoid getting sued for something like that  right, I could say that it is a place that that that  It coddled that group or made it possible for my child to get this disease that harmed her and thus i'm suing  So that's one way we could go after it without the government technically going after it  But the government would be the as part of the lawsuit. We would be invoking the laws of this country if that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incidentally, i'm really going down this rabbit hole. There does seem to be a quite an important distinction between  deliberately lying and  Unknowingly lying. Yes, and this goes back to the very famous stolen valor case  Of 2012  It's actually this is fast. I you know, I I would hate being a lawyer, but I love the law  This is a case where a guy had a habit of lying. He said he played hockey for the detroit red wings  He married a starlet from mexico  But when he announced he had once held falsely once held the congressional medal of honor  He violated a federal criminal statute the stolen valor act  of 2005  And uh and and knowingly is the key here, you know that he  Uh, what was the final decision?

Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You actually read things unlike us  No, no, but I figure harvard's harvard, right if he went to harvard law school, would he be be working with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'd be rich. I tell you the judgment of the court is affirmed the nation well knows  This is justice roberts writing this is only in 2012  The nation well knows that one of the costs of the first amendment is that it protects the speech we detest  As well as the speech we embrace though few might find the respondents statements anything but contemptible  His right to make these statements is protected  By the guarantee the constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and protection the stolen valor act  infringes upon free speech  It's overturned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what's interesting about this? I'm gonna give you another law case right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did not prove harm. Is that why okay? That should be the theme of this show all the proving of harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know what that's an important that's a very important legal standard, right  Yeah, it's it's you can't say well, it's just wrong. You have to show harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't say it could happen, right?  Um, so I this is this is i'm gonna say this is related. Did you know that off the top of your head karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I googled very quickly  Okay, I just I was gonna be very impressed you were in france

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd still be asking what happened because you couldn't get to google  Keska so in in the case of the bezos national inquirer  A fair number of legal pundits on the air were saying well  I don't know if it's if you can actually charge a bribery and extortion in this case because they didn't ask for money  So one of the great things about being in the green room at msmbc is I get to ask the lawyers their questions  so chuck rosenberg who I think is  phenomenal  And I since I explained this to me counselor and he's a former u.s attorney prosecutor  And he said well actually so the problem is that the bribery extortion  definition of of value  Stealing value is limited, but he said in the stealing government property statute  There's a broader definition of value and it includes  intangible things  so  by seeking to get jeff bezos to  um  give up the  journalistic value of the washington post  was am I  Trying to extort value out of him interesting  Right was really so it's the same as stolen valor in a way that notion of stealing valor valor and thus value  Uh, I mean you're right this i'm glad I I was gonna go to law school, too  I'm very glad I didn't I would have a real tough time saying yes your honor. It would not work  I'd be under contempt all the time. I'm warning you. Mr. Jarvis

We know that our carriers are selling our  information  Anybody including bounty hunters if you don't want dog the bounty hunter to know what you're up to  a vpn is a great choice, but  Choosing the right vpn is very important. There are bad vpns virtual private networks out there  There are vpns for instance that spy on you and sell that information. Yes  There are vpns that insert ads into your vpn stream. I use express vpn because I can trust it  It's the number one vpn service and it's not just me saying so tech radar  Lots of users voting. This is the one  Express vpn no logging they don't track your anything you're doing. They don't save any information about what you're doing online  They are very fast. The other thing a vpn can slow you down if they don't have enough servers enough bandwidth  Express vpn does in fact they have servers in 160 locations. There's a list on the website just all over the world  There's another benefit to that because you technically don't emerge into the public internet until you come out of their vpn  Server, which means you could be in england. You could be in singapore. You could be anywhere in the world. That's really awesome  No more geographic restrictions and the speeds are fantastic. No compromises to be secure  That's important too apps for windows  Macintosh ios and android one click apps too you push a button you're you're secure  So it's very easy to turn it on whenever you need it turn it off when you don't  And it's less than seven dollars a month. It is exactly what you've been looking for  Look no farther than express vpn.com  Slash twig don't forget 30-day money back guarantee if if any of if any of this doesn't work for you. No problem. No hassle  You're never going to need it though.

We'll call it that  Google is adding a add to waitlist feature for restaurants  It's provided uh by dine time  As part of reserve by google. I didn't know reserve was a google app. I didn't know any of that  Uh, I use reserve because not everybody is open table  Google  Reserve with google which launched 2016 allows users to book and pay for reservations without leave  Oh, this is not the reserve app or maybe it is but this is built into google search  So you can make a I didn't know this but you can make a reservation in google search and now you can put yourself on a  wait list if as is apparently the case the red lobster in your neighborhood is booked  I  Don't even know you can make reservations at red lobster. So that's just shows you what I know  This is the time square red lobster  So now you can add your name to the list are you excited  Not no, not not me.

Transcript:  This sounds really cool. Yeah, I found this one. It was things like invoicing things you do over and over and over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just an action. Well, you'd want you'd want somebody to write it unless you're a developer  But they can use developers can use the api, uh to create tools that automatically do anything almost anything you would do with a document including  Reading and editing existing docs creating entirely new ones  Lists tables images all accessible. This is something apple does really well with  Their automator and apple script in apps on mac os  But I but if you're gonna I think if this is a great thing to have in the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in the day, I used to do mail merge, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was your big complaint jeff and now it is solved and you can put it on a usb stick for you with your pixel slate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's good because most chromebooks don't have much storage so you don't really want to fill up your limited storage  I've got plenty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh, so so  The advantage of that  Is that I can move the movie from one place to another?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, or you could just not fill up your internal storage and you could just put movies on a usb

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like when you're on a plane and you don't have a connection to the internet there you go

You choose app and notifications  Select google play movies and the permissions option  Enable the storage permission and you'll get a pop-up from now on when you download choose download storage internal or sd card  Cool, but you know what? That was a lot of words just go to the fabulous about chromebooks.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have an oddity kevin since you're watching I have an oddity  That and this happens to me all the time because i'm on planes  That for certain domains not all like my school domain is fine all the time  But certain domains like going to united and I go to the united club or I go on the united plane  It the my chromebook will not see the domain  Because it's new it in another life and I can't get in there to forget it. I can't get anything. I have to restart the machine  For to recognize the domain is there and then it will launch on which doesn't sound that bad except that when i'm in the air  And i'm trying to connect to the wi-fi. Oh, did I have a problem?  This is a conversation we need to have kevin so I can figure out what i'm doing wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
