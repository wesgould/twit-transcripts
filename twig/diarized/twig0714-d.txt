Start time: 230.80
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Can I jump in here and ask a question yeah  She wants to be in blue sky. Yes, but why but but why but not Macedon?

Start time: 242.60
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Because blue sky looks more familiar to what I'm more familiar and less work on my end

Start time: 248.52
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So it's just the t-shirt that it's wearing regardless of what's under the t-shirt

Start time: 252.48
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, I think it's a t-shirt that doesn't have a lot of complicated snaps and issues with it that I'd have to you know  And it's a t-shirt that I wear like a t-shirt

Start time: 261.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're fair you raised this point in our twit community in our forums that normal people are baffled by Mastodon  Whereas if you're already on Twitter blue sky

Start time: 273.04
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Is just like Twitter. In fact, there is that's why normies liked post on news till they thought I was boring, right?  Look familiar

Start time: 279.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  well, and I have to point out that  blue sky has kind of the same flaw as  Post news which is at least for now. It's centralized and it's got Jack Dorsey all over it  I  Have to say no stir. Pardon me. He's on no stir. He's not a blue sky. He's over. Well, he's on both  He's he's on no stir to war and he's funded both right he put money into both  Noster is another  Attempt to capitalize on Twitter's failure and it's also decentralized in theory but not in practice  Neither blue sky nor no stir yet is yeah federated  Whereas Mastodon is and every time I go on a blue sky go why it's starting to be a lot like Twitter and I don't  Know it's it's I don't mean that a good way pixel, huh? It's like pixel for pixel like Twitter  Yeah, well not only looks like it but but it's all of the poop I see the people I already follow  Yeah, yes, that's exactly what they did. That's exactly it on see

Start time: 343.84
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I thought it the whole time this was was federated decentralized in theory. It will be but it is not yet

Start time: 351.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is really at this point exactly like Twitter. They sent its invite only  But they sent out enough fifty thousand that they've got, you know, and they're you know  They already have a  CNN anchor on there who's mentioning  What they call skeets which is the horrible name?  She was a jade is not one she does not like that. The CEO doesn't like skeets because it has a sexual connotation  All right. I think it's kind of a cute name, but I think I thought it should have to go look up. No  No, don't don't don't don't you know what it is. I wanted to don't I want it to be bleats because it's blue sky  So should we bleep? Oh, I like that bleats night. Yeah, you got a little lamb. Anyway, it's too late. That's too late. Guess what?  And in fact, that's kind of my reaction to blue sky like yeah  They have all these great plans to be federated and have all sorts of moderation capabilities blah blah blah. It's too late

Start time: 407.54
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  I think I just had a fascinating discussion. I called Dave Weiner to interview him for the book. I'm working on now. I  Just got the phone with him  And he said that the rochco at  Mastodon had the benefit of being under the radar. Yes years. Yes. He said blue sky is out and probably said everything's gonna happen in two weeks

Start time: 426.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, they're too public now. They're speed running the moderation curve in Mike man. Yeah  Yes, and I think that's exactly it and and mastodon I kind of like because just as you say and it is a little kind of confusing  so  Only people are strongly motivated to be there there

Start time: 445.40
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Which Stacy isn't she doesn't want to be with us there and that's all right. I you know, honestly, I think it's in a way

Start time: 450.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's good that we have these choices because that auto very much so sorts the people  And those of you who want to be on blue sky be on blue sky. That's fine  There is one good thing that blue sky does which I actually think I wish Mastodon did which it allows you to create your own  Hand you know handle based on your a website that you control or a domain that you control so instead of being kind of

Start time: 478.12
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Verification is that makes it like a REL

Start time: 480.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sort of except that it's right there. So if you wanted so I was  Leo Laporte at blue sky BSKY dot  Social or whatever it was but you can easily go in there if you control if you have that it's very geeky  It's harder to do than rel.me if you have a DNS control of a domain as  I do for Leo Laporte me you can make that be your handle  So if you search for Leo Laporte me on blue sky or in theory, it's federated  Affiliates it will always be me because it's my that's mine

Start time: 513.76
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So that is smart. I could do it to Stacy Higginbotham. Yes

Start time: 517.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I own that domain you could be as long as you control DNS

Start time: 520.72
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  You have to put a text field you happen to have someone in the house who's very knowledgeable. I bet you Stacy could do it

Start time: 525.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just a text

Start time: 528.80
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Andrew will do it. Yeah

Start time: 531.52
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  There's that I wasn't gonna see

Start time: 534.24
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, you don't have to say he does handle all of that. So I don't have to I have to  You have other things worry about different things more important. You tried others Leo. Have you tried spoutable or an no

Start time: 544.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to be I've I'm really done with the scent with centralized. I think what Elon did to Twitter is  very likely to happen to others and  There's a favor in the end I got on blue sky  Had high hopes for it still do I guess I like the AT protocol. There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm  The more I use blue sky the more happy I am  About Mastodon. I just I really think this is my home and I can read my home feed now a mess and I followed enough people  I figured out you know  There's enough good people on there that I could follow this and really get everything that I want from Mastodon  Twitter I still go to Twitter once in a while because you know if you want to know what's happening at the Met Gala  That's Mastodon is not the place to go  There was a roach. I  saw the roach video and I  What I really loved was all the cameras following the roach up the steps of the Met Gala  But here's the question was it really a roach or was it just doja cat in in disguise  It was Jared Leto's  Third costume third outfit he went as a cat as did doja cat, but okay.

So we don't have a lot of history on how this is done in in the past  The nobles would pledge their allegiance to the new monarch on bended knee, you know my liege lord and all that very medieval  But in the new modern social era the archbishop of Canterbury says you can all do it  We're going when you we do it on TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so depressing get rid of the monarchy let's talk about Google  Google is very much in the news today. In fact, the biggest story really should be in the change log  But I'm not gonna bury the lead here this morning. I got up early and  Signed up for pass keys Google has turned on in pass keys  For your Google accounts. This is the new  Passwordless technology that the Fido Alliance has been rolling out Google Apple many other companies  You know kind of saying they support it  So yeah, what and what you do if you go to your Google account  First you have to pay for wired then you go to your Google account  Which as you know, I have paid for but I still get this no matter what  Let me go to Google comm slash  What is it my account security?  I'll try security security. We keep your personal information. Oh, they're gonna make me log in  Nope, they're not okay  Your account is protected if I go into the security settings  It will say I it's in you can see you can show this. There's nothing I think I I  Added a pass key at 6 o 9 this morning  And oh you already recognized it it says what so I don't care  I want to see it new pass key added to your account  If you didn't add pass key somebody may be using your account iPhone  so now my iPhone is my Google login and  All I have to do when I want to log into Google is do the biometrics on the iPhone in this case face ID  And I'm logged in no password required. No second factor required  And some a number of people have said, you know, do you really want that?  This isn't that new because I notice I have other past because I have a total of four pass keys on my account  And the reason being oh and look at this. I guess I do have to still do a password  so the reason being  When I got my Google pixel on my Samsung they kind of were added as the single sign-on  masters of my account  So but some people complain that the issue is what if you lose your phone?

Start time: 1143.28
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Right, I think the best issue I had but there's I mean, what are your thoughts on that?  Well, don't

Start time: 1152.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Recovery codes. Yes, you have all the same you know, you're not giving up any of the other ways you had to log into Google

Start time: 1159.56
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Okay, so you said any password to your account, right? Yeah, you still have all that stuff

Start time: 1165.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But the risk if you lost your phone and it wasn't locked or somebody could figure out your  Screen and of course the Wall Street Journal has been going crazy over this like I know I don't know how legit it is  That oh my god  People are shoulder surfing you getting your your login and then stealing your life and they have like three people this happened to I don't  Think it's that common. Yeah  Thank you. Yeah, she'll even have to say it or if you stole my phone with it  Unlocked like I unlocked it and then I put it down on the bar and then you just snarfed it and kept it unlocked  Well at that point but see you still need the face ID when I go to Google  Shoulder surfing my passcode to get into the phone like looking over your shoulder to see them

Start time: 1210.60
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, you've never heard that phrase. Yeah

Start time: 1214.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why well you can thank shoulder surfing for the dots that you always get when you're trying to enter a password

Start time: 1221.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can't see what you're entering  That's to prevent shoulder surfing

Start time: 1226.74
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So if I'm logging into my gmail account on  The web on my computer what the process for me then looks like I then pick up my phone in well

Start time: 1237.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's always been here. Yeah, you you've probably seen that when you're Google when you go to your Google account  After you enter the password the two-factor can also be logged into your phone you've seen that right? Yeah

Start time: 1249.12
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, I have I have two factor on me, right?

Start time: 1251.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm just trying to figure out what the normal this eliminates that experience with this is I think  that will eliminate the  Password part  What on one of us? I've been trying in different ways. It did not happen here  One of the ways what on one of my systems I got a QR code  Which I then had to use on the pass key enabled device  to  enable the new advice device  But I notice here that they want my QR code with your yeah. Yeah, okay  So that that's in theory how pass keys would work if you went so let's say you sign up for the Macy's site  You could it could show you a QR code, which you would then use your pass key your phone is now your pass key, right?  Your phone has this in you know pass key store  And you would then scan the QR code the phone would do face ID or touch ID and the end Macy's would let you in without

Start time: 1306.42
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  A password. That's the idea. Is that the equivalent of doing sign in with Google?  So Google's gonna now know exactly where I'm signing in if I know that's an interesting privacy question

Start time: 1315.08
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I don't even think of that right is it stored on device or is this cloud-based? That was my question

Start time: 1320.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So not all pass keys go through Google  Okay, okay pass keys is not a Google thing. It's a it's a Fido Alliance thing, right?  But if Google is running no in fact even when I log in with pass keys to Google  iCloud stores the key not Google  so the device stores the key and  Apple does not know  What I have in my passkey storage know that would violate the whole process

Start time: 1349.72
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's a secure. So baby basically Google's now allowing this pass key to use to sign into its sites

Start time: 1355.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you use a Google phone, it's a secure enclave on the Google phone, but it doesn't get it passed on to Google  I don't think no, I'm sure it doesn't got it. That would that would mean it's not secure to be stupid

Start time: 1367.10
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  May I add something here? Yes

Start time: 1373.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if you think mastodon is complicated no

Transcript:  Oh, cuz you have a work you have a work worksheets account, whatever it's called workplace account

Start time: 1386.46
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Oh, right. Does it not work with that? No, and so it says well see your administrator. Well, I'm the administrator  And then I go and I try to search for  Workplace or whatever the hell is called this week and paskey and there's nothing there's not like even out of luck sucker or wait or nothing  I'm the second-class citizen again

Start time: 1406.68
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So the something like this seems like it should roll out  Space first before I bring it out to the regular folks like me, right? Right, right effect on our school

Start time: 1417.78
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  We were not compliant and everybody in the whole school had a two-factor so we could be compliant with Google's standards  higher higher security and  And so what they have us on what they would I guess argue our lower standards now  pisses me off

Transcript:  back to pass keys  So long. This is the Google blog scramble security blog post so long passwords. Thanks for all the fish  little  Tip of the hat to the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy  Starting today you can create and use pass keys on your personal not workspace  Personal Google account when you do Google will not ask you for your password or two-step verification when you sign in  You know in a way this is like a Yuba key or you know a hardware security key  the differences with the hardware security key I can have a bag you should have a backup key and that's safe at home or  Somewhere the secure so if you lose the one key you still got the backup key  Pass keys they say are a more convenient and safer alternative to passwords that work on all major platforms and browsers and  This is the mechanics allow users to sign in by unlocking their computer or mobile device with their fingerprint  Face recognition or a local pin. So now you're it's a it's a pass key in sense that that device is  Is like a security key. It's the pass key

Transcript:  Password so when I set this up on the iPhone, that's a good point  Well when I said that yeah, this is a big issue when I set this up on the iPhone Google said, okay your iCloud  Secure Enclave now has the key  so that's up to Apple now to give me a way to  migrate that and  She's I don't think there it I think this is a little complicated to be honest  app  I think Apple will let you export it to or move it to another Apple device  But I don't think they have a mechanism for moving it to an Android device  No, I don't. Yeah, right  and we  Forgive me if I'm wrong and if some if I'm wrong, please correct me  They will  Yeah, no, I know but we've been talking about this no this started months ago, right with Apple's announcement and Google's announcement  And we've been talking about security now  And we've talked about on this show and it's still a little fuzzy  It says unlike passwords pass keys can only exist on your devices again. This is google. They cannot be written down  Or accidentally given to a bad actor  When you use a pass key to sign into your google account it proves to google you have access to your device  And are unable to unlock it  Together this means the pass keys protect you against phishing  Right because a bad guy doesn't have your device  or the pass key  And any accidental mishandling the passwords are prone to such as being reused or exposed in a data breach. So that's the good news  This is stronger. This is what google says and I don't know if I agree with this  This is stronger protection than most two factor of methods offer today  Which is why we allow you to skip not only the password but also  The second factor when you use pass keys  In fact pass keys are strong enough. They can stand in for security keys for our advanced protection program. That's quite interesting  That's that that's the program google offers to members of congress and other high target high value targets  Uh to extra protection you have to have two hardware keys  Uh, it's a very you know, it's and you lose a lot of functionality. So this is  I guess if you believe all this this is good creating a pass key on your google account makes it an option for sign in  Uh, this is important existing methods including your password will still work in case you need them  For example when using devices that don't support pass keys yet. So really you could still fail back to the old way  Pass keys are still new and it will take some time before they work everywhere. However  Creating a pass key today still comes with security benefits as it allows us to pay closer attention  Oh, that's interesting to the sign-ins that fall back  to passwords

Transcript:  So maybe they're gonna that's a signal. Maybe this isn't the most secure  Maybe this is we should take a look at this over time will increasingly  Oh now this this you could take two ways over time. We will increasingly scrutinize  password logins  As pass keys get broader support familiarity. They're kind of in a way doing what google often does  Which is we are so anxious that you move to this more secure method. We're going to start deprecating or being suspicious of the old method  Right  Uh, oh and they are clear. They say that google does not in any way get access  To this information and I think that's the case with apple as well

Start time: 1722.80
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  when I first saw this news, the first thing that came to my mind was if I go to log into my  Google account, um on a different laptop here at the house  It does the little send a notification to whatever device. Yeah, that's the single sign-on thing. Yeah  And i'm like dang it and it always sends it to some other device never to the phone that's right here

Start time: 1744.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So apple apple gets heat for doing the opposite it sends it to every device including the device  You're using to log in at this moment. Right? It says is that you yes, it's me  So I don't know what the right answer is on that

Start time: 1766.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so the other thing about passkeys is you can create a passkey for every device  So you can in theory have a passkey on all your devices so you don't have to go up and get any device

Start time: 1776.52
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Okay, well that that I feel better now in addition

Start time: 1781.72
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  He says that you'll be able to store manage and use your passkeys in one password which would help with the moving from  Device to device. I don't know if that one password has announced support for this

Start time: 1790.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I imagine all password managers will eventually

Start time: 1794.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There's a little caveat there because that I was about to say if we're still into the password

Start time: 1798.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well it also it also yeah, of course, this is their way of staying current  But you but how do you get the passkey into one password?  Since it's living in my secure on playbook my phone this requires apple  To allow you to export it and currently they don't they allow you to move it but not export it  I don't know this there's a lot of questions. This stuff is brand new  Um  For example if you create this is again google  In addition some platforms securely back your passkeys up and sync them to other devices you own for example  If you create a passkey on your iphone that passkey will be available  On your other apple devices as long as you're on the same iCloud account. That's why they call it an iCloud  Passkey because it's stored in the secure enclave in iCloud. This protects you from being locked out of your account if you lose a device  And it makes easier for you to upgrade so when I get a new iphone  In theory the passkey is is in the cloud and will be passed over  To that I think that still lives in the secure hardware enclave on the device, but I think it's copied from iCloud somehow  If you want to sign in on a device for the first time a new device or temporarily use somebody else's device  You can use a passkey stored in your phone to do so  You want to know how?  On a new device you just select I don't know because i'm left out of it, but go ahead  So your pixel isn't it doesn't isn't on your personal account

Start time: 1878.06
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  My personal account is my google account because that's how I could use buzz machine got it on the new device  You just select the option to use a passkey from another device and follow the prompts

Start time: 1888.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting. So that's more like what you're used to uh ant where you sign into google and then it says oh go get your pixel  Yeah, you can you can manually tell it I want to do that, but it doesn't  This does not automatically transfer the passkey to the new device. It automatically transfers the passkey to the new device  It only uses your phone's screen lock and proximity. So you do have to go get it  And put it next to it  I guess it's using bluetooth le or something to approve a one-time sign in if the new device supports storing its own passkeys  We can then ask separately. Oh you want to make one on the new device?  So eventually I guess the premise is all your devices will have the passkey. Yeah, right. I'm down for that. Yeah

Start time: 1927.10

Transcript:  I just have this vision you kind of brought up and if your car is working with this  And you lose your phone and you can't get in your car to go home to find the thing in your locker at home  To turn on the phone to get the car going and then you're screwed  Well, if you lose your car keys  You're screwed too. Well, you're not gonna have car keys anymore leo. Oh, dude  I just wrote about the digital key standard actually ccc. I put it in the rundown. Oh, thanks, ant

Start time: 1952.62

Start time: 1957.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

So this is this is the pass keys. This is my you could show this  This is my pass keys  Interface so I already unbeknownst to me basically had pass keys  Android devices automatically create pass keys for you when you sign into your google account  So my galaxy s23 ultra for some reason has two pass keys as does my pixel 7  And then this is the one I created this morning the iCloud keychain  And then I have and it's in the same space. These are yuba keys. These are the the hardware keys  So any of those will work any these are all considered pass keys  So in effect and I think this is this to me makes sense your phone is like a hardware key  It's like a yuba key and that makes sense, right?  And has the same caveats and concerns  Don't lose it. A lot of people don't have yuba keys. Yeah, and this is easier than yuba key  Much easier and unlike a yuba key. I do have one yuba key  That has a a fingerprint reader on it, but it doesn't work very well with anything  Don't don't so so uh

Start time: 2045.38
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Unlike the yuba key is it because your fingerprints get old away as you get older. No, it's it's a it's a  No, I don't have good fingerprints anymore. I I never I can't even come into the country

Start time: 2070.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was just like oh do fingerprints not work. I like to pretend to be offended. I'm never offended really  the yuba key fingerprint reader  It's it's if if if it doesn't recognize your finger then it locks itself out and you have to launch the yuba key  It's not a good solution  So in a way, this is better because it is biometrics  As opposed to just physically having the phone the phone also has to biometrically recognize you right? So  So  I guess it is more secure. I mean, I think it's i'm sure steve gibson will talk about this on tuesday on security now, but  We've talked a lot about paskeys and the the problems exporting paskeys one of one of them  There's no guarantee that you know apple will let you export your paskeys for use on android for instance  but I i'm glad i'll tell you what google doing this is a big story because  This opens the floodgate. It's been around for months

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, and there is a directory of sites that support paskeys  But here's a dirty little secret of that most of the websites  That support paskeys took a shortcut and use the third party  Of course, uh to do the paskey  Not their own servers. And so there's some question about whether  Uh, that's how many banks do you see on there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Two fa instead of and the reason they do that is because they have those normal people that you keep talking about ant  That can't figure this stuff out  Understandably, yeah, and they understand getting a text message with the code  And so I don't banks are very are not going to get rid of that even though they know it's less secure  Because they don't want to handle the complications of if if I could find a bank that wouldn't do sms  I would do it  But as far as I know every bank does for that reason  Anyway, so you can see there's only 41  Sites right now that support paskeys including google microsoft  Even apple doesn't and here's the one password paskeys demo  And then this is where you can vote for paskeys support these are this companies that don't yet support it  Apple amazon netflix linkedin youtube disney plus steam spotify twitter reddit discord instagram facebook  Airbnb hb max none of these supported adobe venmo booking.com pro tail mail, but you can vote for it

Start time: 2292.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why I'm trying to make sure this is a go. I think they're watching what happens with google  So it was one of those after you alphonse no after you. Yeah  They it was okay  Let google get and it's right for google to do this. I think let them get all the complications and the complaints and  You know make everybody feel better and then I think apple and microsoft will do microsoft already has a single charvis rants  Yeah, it's jeff jarvis rants  so  One password is actually has is one of the big companies that does this back end support  so a lot of times  when you go to a site  And they're doing paskeys.

That's why I feel like only

Start time: 2420.74
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Like you mentioned that it could be stored in iCloud

Start time: 2424.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is a server. Well, they call it the iCloud. Yeah, I don't know. They call it the iCloud key  I don't think it is my under my understanding is it's stored in this secure hardware enclave  On my iphone in hardware, but were I to get another iphone apple  Would handle the transfer from this or the copy from this to the new iphone?  But I think each device has its own secure hardware enclave with the paskey  I don't think despite the name iCloud  It is stored in the cloud. It shouldn't be should never be in the cloud

Start time: 2460.20
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That you're right. Yeah, that's because yeah when you said that I was like, huh?  There's no say that's what they call there are secure enclaves in that cloud

Start time: 2466.74
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  But that was the story last week was that they were you were able to move these things to the cloud

Start time: 2472.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't I yeah, this is so this was the big question that came up when paskeys came out and steve and I talked about this  He is adamant there is no no company as yet allows you to  Export it to another another companies. You'd like you can't go from apple to google or google to apple  You can go from apple to apple to apple to apple  I'm getting information from mr. Kevin tofu. There's the man

Start time: 2498.46
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  He's sending me a nifty little link so i'm going to drop this in the chat that he says that  Well, this is apple's discussion about oh yeah apple also saying to me  Pass keys check if you have the private key locally. No third party service has it  Okay, right  And so what's in the cloud is just going to be a way to check if you have it  In iCloud keychain pass keys are end-to-end encrypted

Start time: 2523.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So even if you have a private key you can't have it in the cloud  Pass keys are end-to-end encrypted. So even apple can't read them  right  And this is apple  it's yeah

Start time: 2534.92
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So it's actually in keychain. So or iCloud keychain, right?  Oh, but then you have to turn iCloud keychain on which is a suck because then you've got to enable all the cloud stuff  associated with apple which is also a suck  I know you have to do it if you're using an iphone, but I don't and I don't want to do it on my ipad

Start time: 2555.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so you're going to use some sort of Samsung solution. They have that, you know, Knox enclave  I think it's going to be very similar. But the question is can Knox talk to iCloud and and google and I  my understanding  When we talked about this before is apple has not has implied that maybe there'd be a way to export it  But they haven't yet done that  That there is no way to export it to some other platform  And I understand for security reasons you probably don't want that right you you want to keep it  Uh tied to your hardware  And it's convenient for apple because  Then you really don't want to get an android phone. You just want to and google's that's what it sounds like  Yeah, google's well, but you know, they can justify it, right?  buy an iphone  I think frankly as much as we lauded this as and as much as we know that passwords are terrible  This ain't the solution and steve who created his own similar, but better solution called squirrel some time ago  Spent seven years working on it has pointed out  Yeah, that was really the problem because he was supposed to be working on something else  And he went to squirrel so I don't know if he did it on purpose  But steve did develop something that he says technically is better  But it's steve gibson's solution not microsoft apple google's solution  So I think it's just kind of a non-starter and honestly he says and I think he's right paskies is not as good  But remember we always make these just like the banks these trade-offs  between real security and convenience

Start time: 2656.52
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Yeah, but that's not encrypted  So and google said yeah, that's intentional because we don't want a lot of phone calls about I lost my I lost my secret keys  This is always the equation see ant this is why I don't care about real people they make it bad for the rest of us

Start time: 2924.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, I understand. I think they're not really saying i'm offended by this but  To their early on when we had a big influx of people. No, no early on we had a big influx of people from twitter  There was a misunderstanding of the culture and and people were trying to explain that the mastodon culture includes content warnings and alt tags  Uh, and I think that it came off as being caught like a cop  Which was not what it should have been but there was this attempt there was a reasonable attempt to try to say look  This isn't twitter now. I have to tell you in my opinion  All that energy you're putting into blue sky. You're gonna deeply regret  I do not think blue sky is going to end up being the welcoming  Loving place. Yeah, we'll see

So it was just it was just rude. Um  and  They added the blocking in but the problem is we talked about this a little bit on twitter  Is that there's a chicken egg problem here  That they can't really test things and build things until they have enough people to use it  And they don't have enough people to use it until they built the things  And problems are going to come up and then it's going to have a bad reputation with those problems  So they're they're on a high wire. They're very much on a high wire  I think I got five invites  I went out until I used one myself  I then told four people I have an invite for you and then they didn't work because they expired  And then I tried to get more invites and they haven't given them to me  And I think they've slowed it down to zero right now to try to hold it off for a little bit

Transcript:  Brianna woo was on twit sunday and her she was she was very much  The black sky needs to invite all the journalists and all the prominent people and that that's what's going to make the difference  Now others will resent that and that's a very unmasked. It on way to look at things  Uh the real people. Um  But it's interesting  to see  Where it positions itself a lot of the question is going to be does it actually federate does it do what it's the proto-social sense?  Is going to do it. What is it going to do it?

Start time: 3187.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, I also think right now it's very much like twitter. So if you liked twitter, you will like blue sky, I think that's true  Uh, all right, and I and I one of the reasons I don't like it is because although I miss  You know, I want I would really like to see the authority. This is what hurt me was I want to see the authoritative news  Sites, you know npr left twitter, right? And of course elon must responses. Oh good. I'm gonna sign npr to somebody else  Which is oh that'll make it much better twitter will be so much better when a fake npr  But what i'd like to see an npr is on mastodon. I'd like to see all of the news  Uh sources all of the governmental issues and stuff. I'd love to see aoc  She went to blue sky. She as far as I know she doesn't have she has an account  But I don't think she has much of a presence. She uses much. No. Yeah, um, so  on mastodon so  I jealous I think the people who are going to blue sky  There's a lot of great content people going to blue sky that I wish they would have looked at mastodon or  Maybe they did look at mastodon. I wish they would have liked it. Um

Start time: 3250.40
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  You know, I got pulled into a discussion with mr. Jarvis, um listener miss adriana pulled pulled me in to some of her  followers or friends or what have you talking about black mastodon and  Uh, how it doesn't seem to be taking hold the way black twitter did and one of the comments was  Uh black twitter was so big to where people thought it was a whole different app  versus being twitter  And my response was well  mastodon  Just seemed to get the attention of quote unquote normal people like 10 minutes ago  uh, so  It's really at least for me. It's really hard for me to expect  Black twitter to just explode and get the prominence that it had on twitter. Um  uh on mastodon like right now, I think it's going to take a while because of  It's got to become more popular to normal people and  Uh get all of the guardrails in forest blocking  trolls and things like that, um  So I don't see why  People are just so up in arms about well black mastodon is just not going to it's just not getting it for me  Well, you got to give it time. It's just going to take some time

Start time: 3323.78
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  so so and I just put up on the rundown for your line 92, uh jabari evans who's a who's a  Hip-hop artist who now is an academic and a phd who studies especially young people on social media  He came to the black twitter summit  He's a brilliant academic and he wrote a really good essay today  And he gave me he was nice enough to say that I helped inspire him to do it along with meredith clark and andre brock  And what he's saying in the end here is that it's going to matter when you see the black owned twitter  That what what happened on black twitter is that black people came in and they used the affordances that were there that were not  Designed for them rabble was at the summit and he said, you know, we we were thinking about people, you know  White geeks who went to south by southwest that's what we built twitter for. Yeah, but we used them to our ends  charlotte mcclrain  Wrote a book called black software, which is about before the web  And places like black planet and so on there was a technological  Brilliance to what was happening that was never recognized  And so you come into another service here where even as intentional as they've been at blue sky  It's not a black owned business. Now. There is spoutable by chris boozy  I I hear controversy about it. I don't know what the controversy is. I don't understand  So i'm not making any judgment which is black owned and there's another one I think called spill  That is black owned so it'll be really interesting to see  whether there are  separate spaces  The same thing is true of media, right?  There's a big ad agency now that's going to go and try to buy a lot of media  Some of the aim to black people would also say  We should be able to own any media  um, and so where where do we come along says jabari to the point that  um  it's not just that  Black twitter is listened to for what's next it gets to build what's next

Start time: 3430.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what is the point? Uh, so there's two two reasons for  Having something like a black twitter or whatever a jewish twitter or whatever one is so that there's a community  But the other is so other people can see right? So it's public right or no. Yes and no

Start time: 3446.76
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Yes, and no the part of the part of what?  I hear argued all the time for people who are being in black twitter is that is that they welcome the chance to be somewhere where?

Start time: 3454.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not under white gaze. So that's another thing by the way, you could do that very well with mastodon  Just by creating a mastodon in since it wasn't open to the public  Yeah, you can make you also want the power on easily

Start time: 3468.82
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  But you also want the power to break out of that when it comes time to do  um oscar so white and black lives matter and so on well then I would submit the mastodon is perfect for that because

Start time: 3479.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3512.18
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's not that hard. No, no a steep learning curve is hard. No  No, it's hard. It's hard. It's hard at first and then you get up there and you're like, okay  But it's like elevation gain, right? If you're climbing up a mountain  a steep learning curve is far harder than or a steep mountain is harder than like  A mountain that you can go over but a learning curve isn't a mountain heights

Start time: 3535.06

Start time: 3545.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's the learning curve from ignorance  To full knowledge, right?  If it's slow, then you're not getting full knowledge very fast if it's steep. No, we're we're pulling okay pull your audience  so as an example  I always said  Changing a diaper is it's a steep learning curve because it's you you do it once and you know

Start time: 3567.76
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Start time: 3600.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, anyway, so it is a steep learning curve  But the steep learning curve makes it but it's not that steep. It's a it's a little there's a there's a there's a  No, no, we've got a little curb but that little bump makes it hard and it keeps out  It keeps out the keeps out people who don't care enough to just get over the hump  So it's really more like a learning speed bump and uh, I think that that's a good thing, right?  Because you only want people committed. You don't want people this is the problem with blue sky

Start time: 3630.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Start time: 3648.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, I've just kind of finished the thought which is I think you're having trouble learning this leo  I think it's a good thing for some things to be a little difficult because then the people who are in  What the real people have some commitment committed ones? Yeah to learning it and I think part of the problem with blue sky  Is just a bunch of people got invites and went yeah, there's a lot of butts on blue sky  And I don't mean if sans and yeah, no there are that was a whole thing

You think I got challenged  I just wanted to complete the thought I agree steep learning curve hard to learn  I don't know where I got the idea that it wasn't I always thought I always thought it was  Hard to learn and then somebody said no. No, that means it's easy because it's quick

Transcript:  Let's talk about normal you want to talk about normal people whom you don't enjoy and how that means that chrome is taking away  The the lock icon. Oh, yeah, let's talk about that. There's not a lot there, but so chrome is decided about vpns in utah

Start time: 3899.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll do that too do that story too. Yes  all right, uh chrome has decided that the lock the padlock is uh,  Antiquated because google says everybody is on  So here's the this is firefox by the way everybody is on  HTTPS now thanks to our successful campaign  And let's encrypt so we don't need the padlock anymore. It doesn't communicate anything  So instead we're going to have two people lying head to toe in sleeping bags  and uh  I don't know how that helps  Actually, the funny thing is firefox already has that it's right next to the padlock. You can't see it  I wish I could zoom in for you  but uh  for firefox  That is a setting those are setting sliders  So it's going to be very confusing because firefox still has the padlock  Uh, and then it also has the two people head to toe in sleeping bags, so

Start time: 3954.20
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  I don't get the same right part of part of google's point was that it was misleading people thought it was somehow safer if it had the lock  Okay, so you you you tell me

Start time: 3963.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3997.24
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  All right, what was the other one? Okay. Well now's a good time to talk about porn in utah

Start time: 4001.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  porn to porn  Yeah, so this is this is an important except that  In the uk, uh, I you know, there are a number of initiatives in the u.s  In other places they're trying to put they're bringing back coppa in the u.s. They're trying to force websites to identify  Ages of its users then of course, that's a real a privacy issue  If every time you go to website you have to say no, let me show you my state id to prove that i'm over 18  Utah has actually been the first to make this a law  If they're going to mandate age verification  Here's the uh sb 287 online pornography viewing age requirements signed into law in march goes effect went into effect yesterday  as a commercial entity that knowingly intentionally publishes or distributes material harmful to miners  Okay, I don't you know  I don't know what that means on the internet from a website that contains a substantial portion of such material  Shall be had liable if the entity fails to perform reasonable age verification methods to verify the age of an individual attempting to access the material  Remember the uk tried this a few years ago. This is the law we were talking about where you'd have to go into a pub  To get oh, yeah porn permission  Um, they they've they tabled that seeing the inherent problems utah did not porn hub, which of course, uh,  Probably doesn't admit that it distributes material harmful to the miners. But anyway, it's adult content. They do call it that  says we can't  Reasonably protect the privacy of our users and find out how old they are. So we're just going to stay out of utah  Which means uh, it's gonna be a beautiful place for a vpn providers. That's all I can say

Start time: 4112.36
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, they I think it was the verge had a map showing how much uh vpn searches searches for vpns shot up in utah  The map is like  The us all the same color and then utah is a bright. Yeah, I think it was green was in 2016

Start time: 4128.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Utah declared porn a public health crisis  An epidemic that is harming the citizens of utah and the nation  Um, so I think probably uh, this is exactly what the utah legislature wanted  And they'd probably like all the other sites to do this. Well, they wanted attention. It's it's it's it's all for show  But it is gent is germane because I think that this the uk's online  Act is going to do the same thing or something similar and you're going to see you're going to see this and  There are several acts now in congress right now our laws proposed laws in congress along these lines  so  You want to hear a great law? Yeah

Start time: 4170.08
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  What's a great law? Do you want to do well I missed I I interrupted ant so no, you're fine. Go ahead  My state washington state is the first state to pass a medical data privacy law. It's called my data my privacy  Um, actually, it's like hb something something something  um  But what it does is  See my health my data act  Yes, my health my data act whatever  It is but it it does a couple things one. It gives you the right to  See what data a health care provider has on you. Yay, delete that data. Yay, and it  Establish it establishes a geofencing boundaries around health care providers and puts that  Data off limits to be sold doesn't hip already do all that  No, so let's talk about what him. It doesn't actually do  Um, because this is something people don't understand and I write about this a lot hip is the health insurance  portability and accountability act  What it is is it protects your health data as it's ported between insurers?  And your doctors when you change jobs, right your health providers and your insurers  And it was designed because we got our insurance in the u.s  Because of our health or because of our jobs, so when you change jobs people wanted to  Move their health data back and forth and insurers had some of that data  And so they wanted to be able to move that around easily and do it electronically if they could  That is all this does so if you send your like health care data to apple apple  It has no legal obligation to protect that data apple does because it's in its commercial interests, but it could sell it  In any any time anytime your data goes out of a medical provider or out of your insurance company  like maybe you fill out a form in your doctor's office to  Maybe you fill out like why you're at your doctor's office. There's a lot of companies that now  Have software to manage that patient intake thing that data actually  Doesn't stay at your doctor. That data is data collected by that company for you  or sorry  By the company for themselves  So that data gets shared wherever if you go on a mental health website and you start like type it in there again  Not necessarily a health care provider. So your data isn't necessarily protected and people misunderstand this  They just think all health care data is protected, but it's not and this is one of the first laws in the u.s

Start time: 4328.88
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Good, we understand something stacy. So you said you can erase things  Can you erase that at the medical providers?

Start time: 4335.78
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So there's some I read the bill  What you can do you can only do this as a consumer you can ask for this data to be erased up to two times a year  So you can't do it after that the providers can charge you so like if you go to the doctor and you're like  Take away all my data and you're like they can be like, okay fine. Sure. We'll delete all your data  And then you have to go back again for something else

Start time: 4361.85
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  You can only do that twice a year without getting charged. So is it only all your data or is it some particular piece of your data?  You don't want there

Start time: 4368.89
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, I guess you could  Here's what i'm asking. Here's what i'm really asking. No, I know you're you're thinking about like my medical data that's relevant for diagnostic exactly  You know

Start time: 4378.76
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  You tend to be manic  Bipolar and in the midst of a bipolar you take all that out and then they don't know how to treat you next time because it's not in the files  Um, you know, I did read the law, but I don't know about that particular

Start time: 4392.74
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Use case. I know there there are guardrails around  How often you can ask your data to be deleted? I don't know if the provider has the ability  I mean because you can pull your medical records from a provider. I believe this because here's the other thing about it spacing which is really interesting

Start time: 4409.88
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Is we talk a lot about you know, this is my data when you're in a transaction with someone else  Right, whether that's amazon or a doctor they have the data too  So you say I want to erase all that data and then you come back later and you want to sue the doctor for malpractice  So the doctor doesn't have their own records in say no, I didn't I didn't treat you for this  Because I have the right to that data too is the doctor because you don't own it. I also own it  It's always inevitable in any in any conversation or transaction. There is more than one party that can claim ownership  Okay, so

Start time: 4444.14
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, i'm i'm looking at the definitions here to see if I can figure this out  Uh, oh the interesting one of the other interesting things about this is in the definition section where they talk about like  Medical data part of what they're putting in is medical data is biometric data, which I thought was kind of interesting and genetic and phenotype  Genotype and phenotype data based on dna  Which i'm kind of like, oh does that mean that I could take a dna tag like one of those ancestry.com  23andme tests and then ask to delete my data after I get my results  Thus meaning I won't be entered into their database because that could be cool  I'm still scrolling through it's only a 20 page law.

I mean there's two real reasons for the strike amazon and netflix  Yeah, there's two real reasons for the strike one is ai but the big one is streaming the last time they did the contract  negotiation and a strike  Uh, there were streaming was considered youtube  It's not anymore and they don't get paid the same for netflix or uh hbo max as they do for

Transcript:  We'll get it all in just a moment. But first a word  From our sponsor miro. I love  Miro we've been using uh miro ever since I discovered them  And this is the hard thing about doing an ad for something that could be anything you want it to be you gotta check it out  But I could tell you this I know a lot of businesses a lot of teams  Are struggling with all the different disparate data sources and you're going from tab to tab and tool to tool  And you know as you do that, there's a you know, a natural loss of energy a loss of information  Miro that doesn't have to happen because miro  How can I put this? It's a collaborative  So your whole team can use it. It's visual  It's a collaborative visual space  That's the same for everybody  So the same data for everybody so so and even if you're working at different times of the day  You could use miro to brainstorm to put ideas in there and everybody's on the same page, right?  Whether you're working from home or you're in a hybrid workspace  Everything comes together in one online  Workspace does that help?  a collaborative  Visual online place for you to put your  brilliance  At first glance, it's kind of seems like a digital whiteboard  But it isn't it's so much more and because of the integrations with miro it can be really so many things  It works with zappier and if this than that you can have can band boards  You can use it with zoom to have meeting timers ice breakers  brainstorming starters  It's a visual collaboration tool packed with features for the whole team  You can shorten the time to launch so your customers get what they need faster with miro  You need one tool to see the whole vision come to life from the ideas the text ideas to the prototype  The planning the researching the brainstorming the designing even the feedback cycles can all live on a single miro board across teams  faster input  Means faster outcomes. In fact users report miro increases project delivery speed by 29  9 percent  View and share the big picture overview in a sense  You can zoom in and out so you can see all the detail you need or zoom out to see it at the  You know 30 000 foot level and when everybody has a voice  And everyone has a single source of truth a single place  Your team stays engaged invested and most importantly happy  Cut out any confusion on who needs to do what by mapping out processes roles and timelines and again  It's all in the same place or you know, you can have multiple boards in the same project. It's up to you  It's very much  What you need it to be  And you got to take a look at the templates the miro verse  At miro.com slash podcast is the place to see what other people are doing with miro. I  That's going to be a much better way for you to understand what you can do with miro than me try to explain it  Because it could be so many things  Strategic planning is easier because it's visual and accessible  You could tap into a way to map processes and systems and plans with the whole team  So they not only can can see it but they can input with it. They can interact with it. They can give it feedback  It's in a fully interactive  And I gotta tell you I know everybody's feeling meeting fatigue, you know, just too many zoom calls  Miro users report saving up to 80 hours per user per year just from streamlining those conversations and that feedback  I mean they got a meeting timer built in, you know  See say we're gonna get this done in 30 minutes be part of the more than million users one million users now  We use miro every month including mica and me we use it for our ask the tech guys show  It's a great way  To see what we're doing to plan together to work together even if we're in different places  Even if we're in different time zones get your first three boards for free  Start working better together miro.com slash podcast. Did you hear that get your first?  Three boards for free because they know you got to try this before you understand  It's one of those things that as soon as you start using it, you'll get it and you'll go. Oh, this is great  But there's no way I can verbally describe it to you. You got to go get those three boards start playing with it  Even if it's just for yourself miro it by the way, it's great just for yourself to brainstorm  Miro.com slash podcast we thank you so much for what a brilliant idea  And for and for letting us share this with you and for their support of the show and you support the show right back  I know it's a it's a kind of a little strange url  We don't usually use that but this is what they wanted to use miro.com slash podcast. I guess we're the only one they're on  So there you go  That has to be us miro.com slash  Podcast but please use that because that's how they're going to go. Oh, you know  These guys are good. They send us a lot of traffic  Miro.com slash podcast  Uh, yeah, so  Let's start with the writers guild of america. They've gone on a strike.

Transcript:  You don't need writers for reality  Programming all the meanwhile ratings people watched them  Yeah, yes. So there is one concern that a lot of us have which is our show's going to go away  What's going to happen to succession or what's going to happen to you know, whatever?  Drama you like stranger things is it going to go away?  And most you know, first of all the shows you're watching today have already are done they've been produced they're they're out  So it won't affect those it might affect shows down the road. How long did the last one go on for?  a long time if you go to wikipedia it has them, yeah  the first it's funny the  There've been a lot of people on twitter and blue sky and elsewhere  uh  As writers that's actually been one of the big topics on twitter this past few days  Writers in the writers guild explaining and reassuring people about the strike saying, you know  There's some really good reasons for this one of one of the issues as you mentioned stacy is ai  There's legit. I think legitimate concern  That we talked about this on sunday or maybe was yesterday. It was on mac break weekly  How many seasons of the simpsons are there  20 30 years of simpsons you have enough episodes you could feed them into an ai and maybe generate scripts

Um, conor o'brien did whole segments just  Spinning his wedding ring on the desk. Yeah for as long as he could right?  It's all kinds of funny stuff like that that they had no writers.

Transcript:  Uh that this is an issue. Um, here's the ai section comparing the  Proposal on the left from the writers guild regulate use of artificial intelligence  On mba mba is the agreement covered projects ai cannot write or rewrite literary material  Cannot be used as source material and the mba covered material can't be used to train ai  That's really an important one cannot be used to train ai. That's the proposal  the motion picture television producers response is  Annual meetings to discuss advancement technology  Uh  Clearly there's a gap. There's a gulf there and i'm sure that they'll I hope that the strike will bring  both sides of the table and resolve this uh  Writers do a very important thing. They get paid less and less as as these streaming companies make more and more  I know streaming is in trouble  One of the one of the writers posted on twitter this paragraph  This is bob odenkirk posted this hollywood companies say they cannot afford  widespread  Raises loaded with 45 billion dollars in debt disney laid off thousands of employees  In recent days disney plus is unprofitable  Warner brothers discovery has 47 billion in debt has already cut thousands of jobs  But here's the important paragraph these companies remain highly profitable  They just haven't been delivering this kind of steady profit growth wall street  Rewards plus let's face it.

Transcript:  They did very good journalism, but it's it's very much like and I wrote about this the ben smith's book traffic  And I have a post on media, which I actually would like to plug  Uh which I reviewed it and if you put together vice plus huffington post plus  gawker plus buzzfeed  They all fit in the same and even though ben  concentrates on buzzfeed and gawker  They all tried and this is my point about media. They all tried for traffic traffic was everything  We get more traffic. Everything will be okay. We get tons of traffic having learned nothing from the the  Web startups of 2000 that used vc money to get traffic for traffic's sake. They went for traffic traffic's sake. Yeah, uh,  Facebook changed things and they got kind of screwed by that but about.com got screwed by panda rewrite of google before that  Whenever the the bad players come in and make more crap  Uh, it commodifies it  Traffic and audience are commodity. They don't have unique value anymore. And so I think this is actually the end  of not digital media, but mass media  I think that gawker and vice and buzzfeed and huffington post were not new media  They were the last gasp of old media

Um  Because they only all they wanted was traffic for traffic's sake  The other part of buzzfeed was that the buzzfeed news never had a business model  It was a philanthropic gift from jona and ben. Yeah, jona just liked news  Yeah, exactly and and never really had a business model. I said that from day one  I said i'm glad you're doing this is good news.

Sorry, not gregory who worked at google was uh the dimes times dubbed him the godfather of ai  Uh and he's obviously of an age where he's probably cashed in on all his stock options so he has decided to leave google  Not because he didn't by the way, he clarified this the times  He said implied that I was somehow unhappy with google not because he was unhappy with google  But because he felt like somebody needed to step up and start talking about the risks of artificial intelligence. Go ahead stacy

Start time: 5748.12
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, I was just gonna say he's legitimately  The godfather of ai in the sense that he way before the big 2012 image search  Moment that really kind of made ai a buzzword again  He was actually figuring out how to do neural networks and training people on how to do it at the university of was it waterloo in ontario?  Or maybe so that sounds right. Yeah, so like I I know him  He's actually the guy he's one of the guys who explained how ai worked to me way back in the day. So  Um, and he taught a bunch of like corsera classes on this so he's  He's not the alleged father of ai but what he is  is  an early practitioner and then a  the man who helped prove that  The amount of parallel processing that we had with gpus could actually make ai financially viable and doable  And then he proved that with image search  Um, or sorry resnet resnet 50 at that competition and then kicked off the whole boom

We don't know what's what we needed new structures to figure out what it is  The issue isn't the technology the issue is how it gets misused and how we don't know how to deal with it as ever  he also

Oliver sacks was wonderful. I I interviewed him many years ago a really brilliant thinker  Neurologist who could write  Uh had written many great books. There was a good article in the marginalia about consciousness  Artificial intelligence and our search for meaning meaning oliver sacks wrote about ai 30 years ago  And talked about uh that you know, what exactly  It is that makes human thought  different than what machines  could do  He wrote for instance. We must indeed be very cautious before we allow that  Any artifact is mind like or brain like  If we're to have a model or theory of mind as this actually occurs in living creatures in the world  It may have to be radically different from anything like a computational one  we talk about this a lot is  with a with a gi with artificial general intelligence, but also  Is it thinking is it sentient?  and uh, here's a guy who studied the human brain who said, you know, there's  There's a big difference between the biological brain and a computer brain  he says  If we're if we have a theory of mind, it will have to be grounded in biological reality  In the anatomical and developmental and functional details of the nervous system  In the inner life or mental life of the living creature  The play of its sensations and feelings and drives and intentions its perceptions of objects and people and situations  And in higher creatures at least the ability to think abstractly and share through language and culture the consciousness of others  Uh, he seems skeptical that machines, uh could do this at least as organized today.

Why did she do it this so okay now there's an article

Start time: 6373.82
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an article. Okay. She made her best line right there good tools  Make it clear how they should be used and more importantly how they should not be used  And her point here which I think is excellent is that is that we just threw a blank box out and said to people  Okay, here it is and everybody's making these assumptions about what it is  And and they're over blowing them or they're misusing them. No kevin roos no machinist with love with you  um, and and and I think that the obligation of the program to say what it is now I can disagree with that too  Because that's very microsoft. That's very very clippy. I'll tell you how to use this program  Um, uh, and you know see the earlier discussion about black twitter people used it however the hell they wanted to use it  But I think that's part of the problem now with chat is that everybody is imbuing into it this power

Start time: 6420.42

Start time: 6452.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not that obvious and it's a really a lot of uh css for nothing  On the open space, I disagree with her  I disagree with her because  Yes, I mean we have we had co-pilot for a year before we had chat gpt  I think the lack of affordances let people try stuff that they wouldn't have tried at all  And so you you know you do what she's suggesting which is kind of you know have a bunch of buttons and switches and dials  That's that is exactly what you didn't want to do because you were trying to find out how people use this stuff  What their reactions to it would would be?

Start time: 6487.82
Speaker: Jeff Jarvos
Transcript:  Right and I agree with you leo, but the issue then is that people say oh my god  It could be anything and we must regulate anything and everything that it might be and that that confuses the world, too  She says idea of having this open-ended thing is scary to people

Start time: 6503.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She says i'm I hope i've convinced you chat bots are a terrible interface for llms  No, you haven't or at the very least that we can add controls information and affordances to our chat bot interfaces to make them more usable  I can't wait to see the I think they're a terrible interface for search  She's not complaining that we had the wrong reaction because there were no affordances. She just  She just wants more affordances and I think that that's just that's that's a matter of taste  um, you know some people want to have everything all  You know in a box and I I think that was one of the reasons chat bt  Caught people's imaginations  Was because they should have given you more affordances to get through the article and I frankly couldn't figure out how the hell to use  Her website so there  No, it's a it's a good point. It's an interesting point  But I don't know I would not couple the lack of affordances  With the reaction people have had to it. The reaction people have had to it is just a typical  Bs human reaction to something  New and they want to anthropomore they were they were going to anthropomorphize it no matter what  Although they didn't do that so much with co-pilot, which is  Basically had to do the same thing  But with a lot of a lot of limits and affordances, right? They said oh no, it's only for this and this and this  So maybe you're maybe she's right  Uh  Do do do do do but you wikipedia by the way, we were talking about those online.

No, it's not an uh-oh  It's a good thing if you're if you're well, it's good in some cases  Dr. Anil hooth a neuroscientist who led the work at the university of texas at austin hook them horns  We said  I've been working on the railroad. Hey, we were kind of shocked that it works as well as it does  He says i've been working on this for 15 years. So it was shocking and exciting when it finally  Did work  the ai-based decoder  Could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy  So they did a couple of things when they had, you know, the function mri is an mri that works while you're thinking  So it's not a static picture. It's a moving picture  And they did it while people were listening to us for us. Yes  Uh, they did it while people were listening to a story or even just silently in their minds imagining one  And it was about 80 accurate they claim

Start time: 7481.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, three volunteers required to lie in a scanner for 16 hours each  Listening to podcasts. That's my nightmare right there. Oh, I wonder I wonder if it was ours  The decoder was trained to match brain activity  to meaning  uh to meaning  Using a large language model gpt1 a precursor to chat gpt  So they don't know what they don't know what the brain activity means, but they know what the input is  So they take the input in the brain activity feed it in the chat gpt and let it using neural networks  and a large language model, I guess  Create actually create a large language model  That matches the brain activity to actual words later. The same participants were scanned listening to a new story  Or imagining telling a story the decoder was used to generate text from the brain activity alone  So now they don't know what it's listening to  So  The decoder was used to generate text from the brain activity  About half the time the text closely and sometimes precisely matched the intended meanings of the original words  So for instance a participant was played the words I don't have my driver's license yet  The decoder translated them as she has not even started to learn to drive yet, which is kind of scarily close, right?  Instead I said leave me alone were decoded as  This is kind of scary  You might want to start to scream started to scream and cry and then she just said I told you to leave me alone  So from brain from blood activity brain signals in the brain  The the the large language model was able to code those words  that's  unbelievable  The participants were then asked to watch four short silent videos while on the scanner the decoder was able to accurately describe  Some of the content this is all from a paper in nature neuroscience  Sometimes the decoder got the wrong end of the stick struggled with certain aspects of language including pronouns  It doesn't know if it's first person a third person male or female  Why it's bad at this. We don't know  says hooth  Uh, this is pretty wild and yes, there's the immediate application for people who are non-verbal  It's a mind reading machine  But you can think of all sorts of negative applications of this as well with everything in life. Yes. Yeah  The police will put you in a machine and they'll  It'll reveal the secrets of things you're thinking

It's nevertheless  Wow  I got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window  Expecting to see eyes staring back at me  But instead finally only darkness to which the decode that was the stimulus the decoded machine said  I just continued to walk up to the window and open the glass. I stood on my toes and peered out  I didn't see anything and looked up again and I saw nothing  Some of that's probably  the machine  Reading the interpretation the humans having of the stimulus

Start time: 8330.78
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Uh, I don't okay. So this is the  car  Let me not make it make sure i'm not making apple apple has

Start time: 8339.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  their own car key thing  And only one manufacturer to date has adopted it after two years and that's bmw  Um, I have a ford that allows me to use my phone as key  They call it phone as a key or paak and since it doesn't work 100% of the time  It's a non-starter, right? Because if you're if you can't get into your car  Then you go back and you get the key or and if you're and as I got locked out once for about an hour and a half  Uh, that's you only make that mistake once but i'm hoping that this new thing is at a time or two in our store

Start time: 8374.70
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you want me to tell you what it's about. Yeah

Start time: 8378.62
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, I just wanted to set it up. Okay  Yeah, and I and I also have a my I use my phone as a key as a key with my tesla  Yeah, tesla always offers doesn't work

Start time: 8389.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Start time: 8389.88
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It doesn't work if you're in like let's say a parking garage and there are lots of cars on top of you because it can't  Call out to the server and it doesn't work when tesla servers are down and you can't get into the app  This is different. This is local on the phone. This is done by the car connectivity consortium  and right now  The goal of this is to use ultra wideband in like pixel or samsung or apple phones  And a bluetooth a secure link with bluetooth to pass  the the ultra wideband determines  that you are  Near the car and exactly where in relation to the car you are so inside outside close enough to open the doors, etc  Etc and that data is passed over bluetooth  to open the car door  and  The key itself is stored on a special. It's a special enclave  It's a secure enclave, but it's it's a dedicated one on the phone. It only does the car key  so that's important to know and  The forum has members that include apple google bmw  Rivian samsung volkswagen  ford general motors honda honda mercedes-benz and mercedes-benz so not everybody but a good smattering of vehicles  and  they  the standard  Versions of the standard I think we're on version 3.0. I could be wrong on which version we're in  But it's only going to start coming out  Probably in a like the next year or two  You're going to see it start rolling out. So they just completed a plug fest at the end of march over at the google hq  Where they proved all this out and so the oems are now like they're like, okay  This is working. They figured out  like in for a user the experience isn't that you have  Of  You will leave your phone in your pocket you don't have to have the app it's all going to be local  So it should work 100 of the time if you have your phone in your car together, right?  And your phone is charged if your phone is not charged  I don't know

Start time: 8517.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know

Start time: 8518.46
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I just and I wondered about the whole because wasn't there like an nfc thing with this many years ago where people just had  These little cards in their wallet or purse or what heavy and it usually and it pretty much just used nfc as they got  Near the vehicle to let them in

Start time: 8533.16
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, and ultra wide band is a little bit more high. It's a higher resolution and it's  Than nfc and it can tell like if you're inside or outside so  It knows more about you than just nfc, which is like nfc is like one to two inches away from the thing  So you've got to take  It's like it's like tap to pay with uwb. It's you don't have to be as close although nfc has that

Start time: 8559.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Advantage that you can't do this snarling the hijacking that's happening with the hundais. My next question  And the key is, you know, these powerful, uh wireless technologies can be stolen in effect  Uh with little amplifiers, I guess uwb might help because your uwb would would say well, he's not there. He's over there

Start time: 8582.54
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right  That's the theory and there's I mean there are definitely like if you go on the ccc website  You will see tons of security papers like there's a lot of like yeah  They're paying attention to that nxp has an entire like section on how they've secured

Start time: 8596.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like i'm not steve gibson would be your guy to talk and do you know if this is related to apple's car key?  Solution like if because they're on the consortium

Start time: 8606.56
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They are maybe they're usually what happens with apple is they give code to the consortium?  So it might be that it is the same. I mean it has to be sort of related because they are both uwb. So my hunch is  Uh, this will not be a heavy and ford is a part of this

Start time: 8621.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I have a ford mustang and the way ford gets around phone as a key being not 100 reliable is  And fords have always had or many fords have had this you have a car a code on the door  So you can open the door with a code  A passcode and then if you your phone can't start the car  There's a password you give your car a password that you enter and then your car will start so there is a backup solution  Um, and you I guess you'd have to have that for any one of these  You know on you know, these fobs are very expensive when when I got my ford  They only gave you one fob because they said oh no  Do you have to worry about it because you're you can have up to five phones be the key  And then it was so unreliable the next time I brought my car and they gave me a second  They said ford told us to give everybody another fob. Yeah  Because it just it doesn't people were complaining about it doesn't work. Well, I hope this uh, I hope this takes off  Is tesla on this? No tesla's not  Nope  Tesla's always going to go their own way. They're always going to go their own way, aren't they? You don't mention them  I ford general motors honda honda mercedes benz and volkswagen  And something called denso. I don't know what that is denso is an automotive parts manufacturer. They're a  Okay  and apple bmw continental automotive google oppo rivian and samsung those are the  Other participants according to uh this article from the wonderful stacy this article that stacy wrote  Iot  I I mean, this is a great idea. It was sad that apple's car key only got  Adopted by one manufacturer and only on some of their cars at higher end bmw's

Start time: 8723.70
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, and if you're a bmd, I mean if you're a car maker  Why would you only work with apple phones? I mean that's  They did car makers did not want to get in  They didn't want I mean look at carplay and  android auto auto android  I mean look at how poorly that is gone for them. So that makes sense and it is it is digital key 3.0

Start time: 8747.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this the other thing that this does much like uh, is it the same is digital key the same as the door key?  spec  For your because one of the things you can do if you have digital keys for your home  Is send it to somebody a temporary key you could share it  And they showed that on their website that the car connectivity consortium you could grant access to a vehicle things like that

Start time: 8771.58
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Now that's all through the so part of the standard is things like titling. So when you change your  uh, when you sell your car you can  Give some you you basically lose access to it on your device and give it over to somebody else  But you could give a temporary access to a repair person. Yes, that's for a driver or a friend

Start time: 8793.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know that yes because they have a whole tesla is very very conspicuously absent from this list of auto manufacturers  Of course, there you go. Okay, they don't do carplay or android auto either. Yeah  No

Start time: 8806.68
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And it took me forever just to get spotify  Yeah, and the idea according to the guy I talked to for the ccc  Who was also at bmw he was like, yeah, the idea is that this will be  A feature for the car now  It won't be like a subscription feature like sometimes, you know  Like remote start or heated seats because I was worried that this would be something i'd have to pay monthly for  But this is something they want to kind of replace key fobs with  Oh, and you're right. They're not going to replace key fobs with a car

Start time: 8836.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute is not a  It says users won't have to do anything. It should happen automatically  Oh the app sizes are getting shrunk  And they're placing background apps into hibernation  So that's how they're giving you a little more storage.

They're very cool  I can tell you a lot about their connectivity options and choices  Um, but so you could use it like this, um  This could be used for cold chain monitoring with an attached temperature sensor  There's also a magnet sensor if you want to attach it, I don't know for magnets  But what so the button turns it on or triggers it or no the buttons triggers a signal?  And you program what you want that in my case. They said it they set it up for me to be a refrigerator monitor  So basically I put this in my fridge and anytime the temperature  Exceeds I think it's like 42 degrees fahrenheit  Um, it will send me a notification and if I press this button it will send me an email that says remember to get milk  So that's what we programmed it to do for me again this so  Don't think of the use case the use case in this case is silly  But if you are a business and you want someone to like hey press this button if the bathroom needs more toilet paper, right?
