Andy's in his hotel lobby and he's going to give us his take on iPad 2.  Thanks for joining us, Andy.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Thanks for finally getting me in here.  I hope that people will enjoy the shot up my nose.  They're worth live video screens on the internet today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I agree.  Gina Trapani is also here from San Diego where she has already decided she's buying an iPad

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have.  I want to talk about it.  I'm a trader.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Jeff Jarvis says.  Jeff is the blogger of BuzzMachine.com, the author of What Will Google Do?  Of course, Gina's smarterware.org.  Welcome all.  Time to talk about Google and the Cloud.  Although I guess because Android tablets are the hot item.  In fact, you could buy a Zoom.  Anybody have a Zoom yet?  Andy, did you get a Zoom?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I have a Zoom in the house for testing.  It's probably going to go back a few weeks, but yeah, I've had a couple now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  XOOM, that's the Motorola honeycomb-based tablet.  One of the things that I thought was very surprising was Steve Jobs taking direct aim  at honeycomb.  He had a little bee icon that he would use to show how useless honeycomb was, how few  apps and all of that.  It's the first time I can remember Steve himself making such targeted attacks at competitors.  Usually it's considered better to not mention the competition, but obviously Steve felt  this is time to go after Android.  Did you notice that, Andy?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  The iPad 2 was just one of the two sets of announcements at this show.  Mostly it was there to demonstrate not just that the iPad will continue to be competitive  against all these new tablets coming out in 2011.  The message was actually that we do not expect to have any competition through 2011.  We have seen the enemy and he is not us.  Yeah, it was a very self-congratulatory event.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had a long video at the beginning about how great the iPad was.  I didn't see the video, but it seemed like it was kind of a tearjerker.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It was your basic talking head in front of a white screen sort of thing.  How it's helping doctors, it's helping kids with certain disabilities.  There was a lot of, you know, it is a magical device and it's working its magic towards  all of humanity.  Not sickening, but it was definitely up there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet, Gina, you drank the Kool-Aid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did.  You know, I've been in the market for a tablet for a while.  Ever since I sold my Kindle, I decided I wanted to get a tablet and I wanted to wait to see  what the first official Google tablet would be, which is basically the Zoom with Honeycomb.  And then I wanted to wait, which I was very tempted by.  I nearly had a meltdown in Best Buy last week.  I was like, it's really cool, I thought.  And then I, but I said, okay, you know what, I got to wait until Wednesday, March 2nd,  to hear what Apple has to say.  And you know, I decided I'm going to get the iPad just because honestly, to me, it's like,  first of all, I'm just, I'm pretty conservative when it comes to buying gadgets.  I feel much more comfortable buying second generation.  It's so thin.  And it just, you know, the two cameras, the fact that it's been on the market for a year  now and has apps that have been developed for the platform is just, is really attracted  to me.  And honestly, just as a developer and as a commentator, I haven't used iOS seriously  in a long time.  I've just been able to make informed and objective comparisons between Android and iOS.  I mean, so many of my heroes, you know, like Marco Arman, even the Gruber, who I know is  just a big Apple fan, they insist that iOS has this magic in it that Android doesn't.  And I want to kind of understand that a little more.  So, yeah, I'm going to get the iPad.  I'm going to develop for the iPad.  I'm porting my app from Android to iOS, which is a big part of my reason.  And I'm going to kind of be able to be on both sides of the fence.  I also use Windows 7 and Mac OS X as well.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For similar reasons.  In all fairness, Gina, I have both since I have my iPhone and my Galaxy Tab.  So I'm...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm buy OS myself.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm buy, try, get for Linux in the mix.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you going to get a, what do they call it?  The smart case, the smart cover?  I don't know how it's smart.  It's a bit of rubber with magnets.  Well, it's magnetic, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The magnets are smart.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's pretty damn cool.  Because not only does it add practically nothing to the size of the case, if you would have  seen me at the demo area trying to play out the game where I bet there's a little mouse  inside the refrigerator who turns off and on the light.  I bet that if I open and close the door really quick, I can get back and catch them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So does it turn on the screen when you flip the cover back?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's incredible.  I mean, even if you pull the screen off and the screen wakes up and the device wakes up,  you close it and it automatically goes to sleep.  And I was actually shooting video of this.  I'm kind of pathetic.  If you just lift up a corner of it and slap it back down for that fraction of a second,  but that corner is up, it wakes up and then when it sleeps again.  That's hysterical.  It's you really, you wait until you actually hold one of these in your hands.  You would think that, my God, I can't believe I'm actually waxing poetic about a damn cover,  but it's Apple.  They can't just say, well, what if we just mold something out of vinyl and slip it in  there?  I know it's going to have magical magnetic connectors that automatically finds the right  place and automatically interacts with the device itself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say that's pretty impressive that they could get people, especially since this  is pure profit, right?  I mean, it's a piece of rubber with magnets that costs $30.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Andy, do you think that if you had the iPad with the cover on it, sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Andy's a little lagged because he's in the hotel lobby.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, right, because he's on the wifi.  My concern about the cover, I totally dig the magnet idea.  It looks a little flimsy.  Am I going to be able to take the iPad with just that cover without the wrap around, put  it in my bag with maybe a regular notebook and a couple other items and it's not going  to come off?  I mean, those magnets strong, is it really going to protect the screen in a bag with  other things or am I going to need a sleeve on top of that cover?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  The magnet is really, really, very strong.  I actually lifted up the iPad on those magnets.  Really?  I wasn't just like twitching it around, but I carefully lifted it up and yeah, it did  actually come up in the thing.  I think that you're more in date.  The only thing that I would be worried about is when I put it in this big noisy sort of  bag with all the stuff in it, are the magnets going to be attracted to anything else in  the bag?  Will it be possible for me to sort of like shear the magnets off the side of it?  But the thing is, when the cover is in place, and here's the bottom line, it really feels  as though it's a built-in cover that's held on firmly by screws.  Once you put this on, it really does feel as though it was a design element.  It really is Apple explaining that the reason, it's not $39 because it's $39 worth of stuff.  It's $39 because we put about $100 worth of thought into how to make a cover for this  device.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's pretty impressive.  If you really want to spend money, you can also get a $70 leather version of the same  thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I cannot believe that I'm going to buy this freaking cover, but I am.  Well, you know what?  You almost have to because all the existing iPad covers will block the camera.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you...

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But I'm sure they're going to switch to the new one soon.  But it has another really cool trick on it.  If you roll it up, there are magnets actually inside the cover itself that will turn it  into a wedge that will hold it at the right typing angle.  So it's not like it will all fall apart.  And Apple says that this isn't going to be like MagSafe connectors where they own the  technology and you have to buy a license to use it.  Essentially, if you want to design something that has magnets in it and it's a magnet that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's magnets in the iPad.  So it really is a strong bond as well as in the cover.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  What was the old Acleo Senior Wences class?  Senior Wences.  Hello, Eddie.  Hello, hello.  Hello, Eddie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It means nothing to you, Gina.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It means nothing to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does it have to do with that?  Is it like a Senior Wences cover?  Hello, hello.  That's the way the fix strikes me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's $39 in pure profit for Apple.  That's really what it is.  It's a good deal.  It's a good deal.  It's a good deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a good deal.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I think you've just defined the iPad 2 version of the Flashlight app.  The first guy who does a Senior Wences app that does when it lifts up.  It says hello.  Hello.  It will make $100,000 in a month and then never sell another one after two months.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It also reminds me of Quickdraw McGraw.  Hey, Baba Louie, all right?  Say it.  I wonder if they can expose the magnet API to developers though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A magnet API.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't believe we're talking about a freaking magnet API.  There it is.  Let me just show you the...  Hello, Andy.  I've got to go back here.  Magnet API.  Well, there is an open magnet API that all Apple devices are now supporting.  There it is.  That's the Senior Wences moment.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, Baba Louie, all right?  All right, all right, baby.  Oh, hello.  Hello.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hello.  The chat room says, damn, Jeff is so old.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if Jeff's old, I'm as old.  So, oh, we lost Andy.  Let's get him back on.  So what is it, Gina, though?  You don't have an Android tablet?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do not.  I do not have an Android tablet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is it about this that makes you want it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The iPad?  Yeah.  The fact that it's been around for a year and the apps are built for it, that it's mature,  that it's so light, that the battery life is so long, the Zoom's battery life wasn't  great.  The form factor on the iPad just looks amazing.  I mean, listen, I'm not saying that I won't ever have a Honeycomb tablet.  I just think that it's just too early.  And I kind of felt this.  I didn't get the iPad when it first came out because I kind of felt like, let this be out  for a while.  I haven't decided whether or not there's room for a tablet or I need a tablet.  But once I sold my Kindle, I was like, I want a tablet.  And it just, it seems clear to me that right now, at this moment in time, the iPad is the  most superior tablet on the market.  Not to say that an Android tablet won't catch up at some point.  But yeah, it looks really cool.  And I fell for the whole case thing.  I'm going to buy the case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Andy, you've held it because they had a demo room.  Does it feel lighter and thinner?  Is it noticeable difference?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It really does.  I mean, I had my iPad with me, obviously, and I was holding both in my hands.  I'm sorry, but I don't know how they got all that space out of it.  By the time you're holding an iPad 2 in your hands, you feel as though you're holding the  thinnest object of any use whatsoever you've ever held in your hand.  It's just it's just boggling.  I actually had to do I actually had to put them both screened down side by side to make  sure I wasn't just imagining that, oh, I bet they just tapered the edges down.  No, it is that much thinner and it feels that much thinner.  And after having spent the past two or three weeks playing with a whole bunch of different  Honeycomb tablets, nothing on Android.  When a consumer comes in with five or six or seven hundred bucks in their pocket with  a desire to buy a tablet, nobody is going to pick up an iPad 2 and anything else and  think that anything else is in that same class.  It has that kind of a response to it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My problem at this point, I could probably save face by saying, well, another has two  cameras of course, a co-coursel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, we should just to rub it in, point out that very famously had a re-boxing of his  iPad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Your re-boxing was more about the fact that it's a consumption device.  It was political.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the problem I have now really is I'm addicted to the size of the Galaxy Tab.  The fact that it's in my pocket and I'm thumb typing.  I imagine so I'm gadget nut.  Honey, I really need to have the iPad because my students are developing newspaper things  I need to see what Rupert's doing.  Oh, I can play it up.  I can do it.  Right.  I don't know how I use it still because it won't fit my pocket.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, here's one thing speaking to that original objection that I thought was very interesting.  They really emphasized GarageBand and iMovie in the talk today.  It does in a way address that issue of it being a content consumption device.  Very much more with the camera.  Those two applications, the ability to shoot 720p video, it does look a little bit more  like a content creation device.  I tell you with the camera apps on iOS, that's going to be an impressive camera.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I think it's a different message entirely.  I think one of the main reasons why they pushed out those two apps is because they are really  going to be banner holders for here's the difference between how good an app can be  on an iPad and please consumer, go ahead and compare this to any app you'd like on Android.  It really underscores the general attitude of we don't feel as though there's going  to be any competition for the iPad in 2011.  Although your point is very well made, I did spend some time building things with iMovie  and with GarageBand and boy, the iPad version of iMovie might be one of my favorite video  editors.  Speaking of somebody who always hates video editors.  No, it's a natural way to edit because you're handling it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very visceral.  That clearly is what Apple is starting to say and I think that with the new laptops  with thunderbolt on them and the ability to do a touch screen, I think iOS and touch is  going to, this is in a way pushing us more in that direction of full screen apps which  OS X Lion will support, iOS style interfaces.  I know Steve says we don't want to reach out and touch and I agree with him on a laptop  screen but I have to say it's such a natural interface for some things like GarageBand  and like iMovie that we're going to be clamoring I think for that ability.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of my other issues back when was the difficulty of getting stuff on it without a USB.  How have you found using it now?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think one thing they did that was stunning is this HDMI mirroring adapter which means  it's now a home theater device.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Not only that but the fact that every single iOS app gets video mirroring for free.  I don't have to support it, just simply this.  Take that, take the 9x graphical performance and also take the fact that it has a built-in  gyroscope and think about the games that can be built with this thing.  This is a controller for your big screen TV.  You plug that into an HDTV now and you will have something pretty formidable as a gaming  device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very intriguing.  Did you find out Andy, because they don't say it anywhere even in the tech specs on  the website, what the resolution of that rear facing camera is?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  No, I did try to email myself a picture but no go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to guess that it's the same as the iPhone 4 but it may not be that good.  All they said is 720p 30 frames per second video but you could do that with a flip cam  with upscaling.  They don't say native 720p so until we know the resolution that could be a sticking point.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'm not going to even guess.  Interesting, what I found interesting was the fact that the camera app for the iPad  is identical to the camera app for the iPhone.  So you do have selective focus, you do have selective exposure but it's not as though  they decided to use that extra screen real estate to put some extra features in the app.  It is just the same app you get before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well that's an opportunity for people like Lisa Bettany and third party camera apps.  You're right, Jeana.  I know it.  Jeana's going like this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Am I going to be walking around taking pictures like this?  It's kind of weird.  Slap in my hand?  You know, like, oh wait, hold on.  I think you are.  I think you're going to get used to it.  Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think especially with video, I can see this because this is a full screen monitor.  I mean I can see you shooting video like this and you're really seeing what you're getting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Andy, did you try Movie Studio in Honeycomb and how did you think that it compares to  iMovie?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I did try Movie Studio.  I didn't build anything start to finish with it but partially because I was kind of thrown  off by the interface.  I think that Movie Studio is a functional app.  I think that iMovie is an app you'll use because you'll want to use it.  I'd rather, Movie Studio, you use it because it's the app that's on the device that does  the okay job.  Whereas iMovie is going to be, hey, since I'm waiting for my plane anyway, why don't  I cut together a really good video and post it to Facebook, post it to YouTube, post it  to CNN before my flight boards.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interesting.  See, this would be really interesting for me because I'm not a movie editing girl.  I just, movie editing, I love it and I took a workshop, a weekend long workshop on it  and it took me literally eight hours to cut together my final project which was about  five minutes.  Right?  So it's like, I love it but it's exhausting.  It takes so much time.  So I'm really interested to see whether or not iMovie on the iPad will move me and be  easy enough for me to do more of that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not to turn this into Mac Break Weekly as they say in the chat room right now but...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're going to get to Google stuff.  We'll let Andy go.  This is a big story.  We're going to cover it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree.  I'm asking questions.  It's my fault.  I'm asking questions.  So the changes that I will get on my iPhone that includes hotspot?  Well...  Yes.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  There's also a preview of iOS 4.3 which is going to be released the same day as the iPad  and yes, mobile hotspot is coming to every phone that runs 4.3 so you will have it on  AT&T as well as Verizon.  It will not be available on the iPad though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What remains to be seen is how much AT&T might charge you for it and so forth and so  on.  What kind of limitations the carrier might put on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What it says is that in terms of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, hotspot has been available in Europe, right?  This is not new.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But my point is this.  If I were to get an iPad, one can now more easily get it without a phone contract.  Get the 499.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, you can always get it.  The 499 without a phone contract.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you could use your iPhone or your iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have an iPhone or you have an Android phone so now you can be pretty much guaranteed  of hotspot.  Then...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Then you don't need 3G because you got the 3G here and then it just kind of beams it  over.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The problem with that for my Galaxy Tab, the reason I went back and switched to getting  it A was because it has hotspot, I needed hotspot.  B because I wanted to do the mobile stuff with it so I wanted it to be mobile aware.  If you buy the iPad without a mobile contract, does it have GPS?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Only the 3G model has GPS.  However, you can buy the 3G model without buying a contract.  It is always month to month.  All I'm saying is if you're trying to save money on this and try to buy something less

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  expensive and get the functionality, what you give up is mobile aware of things, geo  aware of things.  With the hotspot, otherwise you're kind of okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  GPS is missing from the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, that's the main thing you would give up.  Just for the listeners, if you have an iPhone, you go to hotspot, you get the cheaper iPad,  you're okay except for that.  Precisely.  The other thing I saw in Canada, Rodgers just did a new plan in Canada when I was up there  a week ago that finally has the plan where you can do multiple SIMs, multiple devices  under one data plan.  And finally, that makes perfect sense, you pay 10 bucks a month more per device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who would think that Rodgers would end up being an enlightened company?  Exactly.  It's like the last company I would expect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wouldn't have thought so at all.  Having worked for them.  I want that so much.  I want to be able to have and they should want me to want it.  I want five devices, six devices and not have to do another huge contract because they don't  know what they're missing in terms of the things I won't buy because I'm not going  to do a full $80 a month contract.  Makes it too expensive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, anything else to say?  I'm going to let Andy go because we're going to go to, there's a lot of other Gmail and  Google search stuff to talk about, but anything else you'd like to say?  Oh yeah, I got one question for you, Ross, since I didn't watch the video.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How'd Steve look?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Steve looked great.  A lot of people, it was a big surprise.  He got a big hand from everybody in the room.  He looked no different than he did from previous appearances.  Also, I have to admit that when he left the stage for the video, I was thinking, okay,  now if he's going to disappear, disappear, but he was just standing by the side, standing  just off stage.  He did the whole thing just as always.  Yeah.  Did the whole thing standing up and by the, at the end he seemed just as strong and he  was in just as good of a voice as he was at the very beginning.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know his doctor from a personal relationship with him also saw him in Europe, and of course  he's not going to say anything about Steve's particular case, but he was, he wrote emails  to some of these doctors who, not knowing a damn thing about the case, were speculating  about it in the press.  He was saying, how dare you?  Yeah.  And everything that Steve's body has gone through, God knows, but he, you know, joke  about him here and there, but he's our hero, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and I, you know, he got a standing ovation when he walked on stage and I have to say,  I would have been there standing up with everybody else.  Yes.  He wouldn't let you there, Leo.  No, he wouldn't.  He doesn't like me, but that's okay.  I still like him.  Andy and Nako, thank you so much for coming all this way to cover the event for us.  We really appreciate it.  Thanks for joining us on This Week in Google.  Good to see you, Andy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thanks, Andy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good to see you guys.  Thanks for the flocked wallpaper and we'll see you.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Oh, Barbary coached action there.  To answer one question on Twitter, I'm not in the bordello.  This is just a very nice, very nicely decorated hotel lobby.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All San Francisco hotels look like bordellos.  That's just the nature of the beast.  Thank you, Andy.  Exactly.  Take care.  Andy and Nako, Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, CWOB.com.  And he was in there with the press covering the announcement.  We do have a, if you want to watch the full analysis as we did it live this morning on  Twitter, that will be MacBreak Weekly, which should be out by now.  And you can download that and listen to that.  We didn't have, they didn't stream this as they have the last two events, but we were  able to talk along with the live blogging.  It was somewhat, Tom Merritt and I kind of likened it to the old days of radio where  they would do baseball games via telegraph.  It's frustrating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's so frustrating they didn't stream it.  It seemed like it stepped backwards.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  I have to say with the iPad, there were certain things I was disappointed about.  I'm sorry that there wasn't a retina display.  I'm sorry there wasn't a price drop.  And I'm sorry that I'm going to have to rebuy apps twice.  But then again, it's like if I have to buy Angry Birds twice, it's fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't have to rebuy?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like in the Android market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Anything you'd bought on iOS though, you could bring over.  But you don't have anything in iOS, do you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  But you've got to buy separate apps for the iPad versus the phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not necessarily.  In fact, a surprising number of apps work on both.  Oh, they're just now compatible.  They do.  It's called universal.  And as time has gone by, I think more and more apps are universal.  Makes sense.  Yeah.  So we're going to take a break.  There is a lot to talk about.  Google changed their algorithm significantly, causing one major media company to fire 10%  of its staff yesterday.  We'll talk about that, the Gmail outage and more in just a bit.  You're watching Twig This Week in Google with Gina Trapani, SmarterWear.org, Jeff Jarvis,  BuzzMachine.com.  This show brought to you today by Carbonite online backup.  You got to back it up to get it back and do it right with Carbonite.  I can just make that the commercial.  It all rhymes.  It all goes together.  It all makes sense.  Why Carbonite?  First of all, it's automatic.  You don't have to think about it.  That's very important.  Any backup solution that just doesn't happen automatically is not going to make it.  And it's not backing up to a local hard drive.  Now, why is that important?  Well, what if, you know, in fact, I encourage you to still make local backups.  Use an external drive or USB key or CD-ROM or whatever, because it's convenient.  But what if the worst happens?  What if there's a fire, flood, an earthquake and you lose everything?  Somebody breaks in, steals your computer and the external hard drive?  That's not a real backup.  Everybody, every backup expert I know says you got to have an offsite backup.  And that's what Carbonite does.  Automatically, whenever you're connected to the internet, Carbonite is trickling your  data up to the cloud where it's safe.  Not only in case of disaster, but you can access that data.  It's really offline access.  You can access that data anywhere, anytime from any system.  Just log on to your Carbonite account.  There's your data.  They even have a free iPhone and BlackBerry app.  So your data is always accessible and available.  So it's kind of like, you know, cloud storage in addition to backup.  And the price is right.  It's the last man standing on Unlimited.  $55 a year gets you unlimited backup from one machine, the internal drive on one machine,  your personal data.  You know, obviously it's not going to back up, you know, 800 external drives, but the  internal drive on your existing machine.  And it also uses your bandwidth.  So I do want you to try before you buy, make sure that, you know, that you have sufficient  bandwidth and the speed is adequate for you.  You know, sometimes I get emails from people saying, you know, it's going to take me a  week to back up my 300 gigabytes.  So it's like, well, dude, yes, it's not magic.  Of course it is.  Because it's very gentle.  It's humane. It doesn't tie your system up.  It doesn't tie your bandwidth up.  But it does. Once you get that first backup done and that should take a week or so, then  always up to date.  And I love that. Try it free for two weeks right now.  Go to carbonite.com.  Use the offer code twig.  If you decide to buy, you'll get two additional months for free.  Carbonite backup done right.  Don't come crying to me if you don't do it.  Carbonite.com.  Speaking of backup, Gmail.  Oh, now it's only point.  They say only point oh two percent of all Gmail users.  But that was a lot of Gmail users.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's tens of thousands of people.  Scary to happen to you.  Yeah. Terrifying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I would have panicked for sure.  Gina, what happened? There was an outage.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There was an outage. So the official company story is they  released software that had a bug that got disseminated to their various Gmail  servers before they caught it.  So they so the data, their hot backups, you know, it ruined their hot backups.  Basically, they had to bring back the Gmail data from tape from tape, which is why it  took so long for them to relatively to get it back online.  Yeah, scary stuff.  I mean, hey, this happens. Bugs happen.  But if you're you know, if you depend on your on your email and it's in the cloud and  this goes for every kind of cloud service, it's always kind of a good idea to have a  little bit of a backup plan just in case this kind of thing can happen.  I mean, kudos to Google for being transparent about it, for being communicative, for  explaining what happened and explaining what they did to bring it back.  It makes me really happy that they have hot backup and cold storage.  So if things went terribly wrong, they bring back my email.  But, you know, if it was the middle of the week and, you know, I had some really  important important email that I couldn't get to, I'd be pretty freaked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People are out for like seven or eight hours.  There was no email at all.  Yeah, that's nothing was lost, but that's no email at all for seven or eight hours is a big deal.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. This is this is kind of my Gmail nightmare.  My Gmail nightmare is actually trying to log in and being locked out and not not being able to get to my stuff  and being just one person with, you know, with no voice.  You know, I mean, this was like an outage that affected a lot of people.  People were going crazy talking about it.  I got coverage. They communicated what was going on, that kind of thing.  Either way, if you're storing kind of mission critical information in the cloud, it's always a good idea to have a backup  and to back up your Gmail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so what's the best way to do that?  Is it back up a file?  Is it, you know, what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Kevin Burdey wrote a good article on Lifehacker here.  Suggested. Yeah, he did.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There are several, several options.  You can use something like Backupify, which is an automated thing that I use.  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah, you pay for it's automated, just kind of does it in the background, set it, forget it.  You can do things like back up your Gmail to a Hotmail account.  So you kind of redundant cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's fine. I mean, what are the chances of Google and Microsoft flopping at the same time?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. What are the chances?  Exactly. And then there's nerds like me.  Like I do. You know, I'm crazy.  I do. I have once a month I fire up Thunderbird and I pop all my Gmail from the previous month and I have kind of a local backup.  But you know, isn't a great solution because if it's the last day of the month, I still don't have a month's worth of email.  But I just like the idea that I have my backup and then it backs up to my backup service and on my time machine drive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's your data. And then it's searchable, too.  I mean, it's kind of like you have the database of all of your emails.  I think that's a nice thing to do and it's free.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It will be smart for Google to make deal.  It doesn't say very good PR thing for them if they say, oh, you got to back up on some place.  On the other hand, for all these services to say, listen, it's your data.  So here's some options for you.  Here's how you're portable.  And it would take away the oh, my God, they have my data and they've imprisoned me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I think the IMAP and a pop access is that, you know what I mean?  I think they couch it in like, hey, you can get it.  We can get us and you get Gmail on any client, but you can also use it as a backup.  They've never kind of explained it as a backup.  Although Matt Cutts back in 08, I think, did a did a blog post like, hey, here's how to use Fetchmail or  another command line client to sort of schedule backups via pop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, yeah, Fetchmail is also in that life.  Actually, you're the one who wrote the article.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had written up the article on Fetchmail, but then, you know, I gave up and I just went with Thunderbird  because I was dealing with different PCs and SigWin and all that madness.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you weren't on Windows, you could install Fetchmail on your Mac or your Linux box.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. And you could cron a job that pulls it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what you want to do.  That would be a great way to do it.  Oh, but you have to have Procmail, XM and Fetchmail.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Yeah, there's a lot to install.  There's a lot of nerdness happening there.  Yeah. And just a lot to install and configure.  You know, and my solution, which is to I have to remember to bring up Thunderbird  and pop my mail and bring up any kind of local mail client, which is also not great.  But I have just a recurring event on my calendar to do it.  Which makes me better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Backup, I guess, is always the rule.  And the good news is Gmail followed the rule.  Google had backups.  It just was off for a while.  See, a backup isn't going to solve that fundamental issue of you're not in touch.  Not only should you have a backup, you should have a second email solution.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. You know, I mean, well, you know, when you use Google Apps for your domain,  you know, I can move my email address to any service provider and it doesn't change.  You know, I mean, if you're using vanilla Gmail, then.  But then again, Gmail gives you the the option, right, to send.  You can you can send from any address.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's what I would do.  In fact, what I do do, I have Leo at Leoville dot com.  That's not a mail server.  That's my server.  And it uses an MX record to forward the mail first to Gmail.  But then I pop it from fast mail, which is an IMAP solution, and actually use fast  mail as my connectivity.  So I have copies of everything on Gmail and fast mail.  If Gmail were to go down, it's just a simple change of a DNS record to say,  oh, don't send it to Gmail, send it right to fast mail.  And I'm no no worse off.  So that's that's a way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's good redundancy.  That's really good redundancy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sad thing now is that you have you have even more copies of the thousand  emails a day that you don't want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'll never lose them.  Someday I may retire and you may get an email response from me like 30 years later.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twenty years of Viagra spam.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't die until I answer all my emails.  I could use that Viagra now.  You guys stealing business?  It would be funny if I started answering.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got an impotence joke and a Viagra joke at the same show.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why do you take this personally, Jeff?  It would be funny if I started answering email 30 years later.  Hey, I got your email back in 2007.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's like those great stories you see on TV.  They love the story where suddenly Mabel's email was lost in the post office for 60 years.  Yes. Now this is the email equivalent of that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's the dead letter file, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I like the idea.  That'd be a really fun meme.  Go back to Gmail, find a five year old email and just respond to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that would be fun.  I did that by accident.  I did that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I heard this on Twitter.  Didn't you have an email from your tech TV pals?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Show up in your inbox.  Well, it was because it was when I was setting up this Gmail fast mail thing.  And so I fetched it.  You can go back in time and fetch all your Gmail.  And I did. And it was back 2006 or something.  It was it was it was it was an early Twitter email.  And I didn't realize I didn't see the date.  And I thought this was a new email.  And I responded to all.  And it was I think it was just this weird, strange dissonance for people that they  were getting this email about a topic that they had discussed five years ago.  I love it. It was kind of weird.  It was dead lettery.  So we are going to talk about Google's new algorithm.  You know, poor Jason at Mahalo, he says he fired 10 percent of his staff  because he's seen a dramatic drop.  In in hits because Google has deprecated their content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So irony is the Mahalo is more human.  They're not really demand media.  Yeah, they're not really a farm.  I don't think so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think so.  So I guess back to Gina, what the hell happened here?  What is this? There's a new a new algorithm.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, so they say Google changes the algorithm to reduce,  you know, lower quality content placement.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's a constant. They're always doing that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're always doing that. Right.  But it sounds like this algorithm change was especially sort of targeted toward  content farms, however you define those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it demand media or is it something else?  It's primarily demand.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's primarily demand.  That seems to be word on the street. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's what Google said. It's not demand.  No, it's it's like these link farms.  It's just another form of link farm. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That too. If you look at the list of who was affected,  it was link farms and content farms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I saw that list and we had Kara Swisher here on Sunday on Twitter.  She had just spoken to Yahoo, which bought  with the demand media company. I can't remember their name.  Associated content, associated content, associated content was on that list.  It was like number five of sites that were kind of pushed down.  And she says Yahoo denied it.  That, in fact, they said, you won't we won't really know for quite a bit longer  whether it's impacted us or not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So did demand.  But these were independent stats from elsewhere.  And, you know, I think that the.  You know, as we discussed, Google is not  have the problem that the PR would make the PR would would make us believe they  have nonetheless, the PR is a problem and they had to deal with this.  And it affects their reputation.  And so, you know, I think there's a flight from crap.  That we've always had crap, as I always say, the Internet has always been filled  with crap. That's not the issue.  The Internet, the problem is finding the good stuff.  And Google in perception was getting less good at finding the good stuff.  And I'm interviewing Marissa Meyer and Tim Armstrong at CUNY next week for the  start of.  Oops, I just realized my God, I'll be on the show beforehand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, good. Oh, I wish you could go after.  We'd love to hear the results of that.  Well, it'll be a lot later.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Be a lot better. So hopefully it starts at six o'clock.  So I have to be off on time.  But OK, we will get you on time.  But, you know, I want to question both about, especially after Armstrong's  PowerPoint or the AOL way and Google doing this is, is are we trying to improve  the quality of the web?  You know, I think that what people tend to use more and more is Twitter and Facebook  and peer links.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's what's hurting Google, right?  They're using social search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's really the issue to me is that is the quality matters there that they've  got to find ways to improve that quality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're competing with a curated search, curated, in fact, by your social graph.  I mean, that's pretty damn good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, as Matt said on this very show, really long before this argument came out,  as he said here on Twig, they were looking for signals of originality and quality.  Right.  And that, you know, what's the line between crap and spam?  I don't know who said that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The lines are really blurry, right?  That's the issue. How do you define content form?  But, you know, how many people share links to Mahalo or eHow to their friend,  like recommend them to their friends?  You know, if I want to learn how to unplug my toilet, I'm probably going to get an eHow  article, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But are you going to like it on Facebook?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But am I going to start on, right, am I going to like it in Reader?  Am I going to start on, am I going to share it on Twitter?  Am I going to post it to my blog?  Probably not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Those links tend to be topical content, right?  Mostly.  So what about non-topical content?  Yeah, you don't share non-topical content that much.  Maybe you do. I don't know. Maybe it's just me.  Almost always when I share something, it's something, it's newsy  or of great interest, but it tends to be, you know, in fact, when I see on Hacker News  or other places articles that are several years old, I go, what?  Didn't you read it when it came out?  What are you linking to it now for?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good point.  But freshness is a signal, right?  I mean, it is. It's a big part of the signal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think one of the key signals here  that will make media companies happy is brand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Because demand media is supposedly a bad brand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. And so, you know, that's helpful.  If you look at YouTube, yeah, you can do the Mentos thing and you can make money  on viral, but YouTube said this week that they're paying hundreds of people,  six figures and thousands, five figures a year on YouTube.  That probably doesn't come from one video off at a time.  It probably comes from building a brand and having a following.  Right.  And so I think that that starts to matter here, too, is that you want to be how had  a brand and got a whirlwind, but it got bought.  But that's one of the signals you have is this is a reliable home for good stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting.  Demand Media's CEO says didn't affect us.  We're not journalists. We don't care.  Blah, blah, blah.  This is Mike Shields writing an ad week  this week, Richard Rosenblatt, co-founder and CEO of Demand Media.  When he heard that Google was changing its algorithm with an intent to weed out  content produced by companies like his, he didn't panic.  He shrugged.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What else is he going to say?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, what else can you say?  That's why I was surprised by Jason.  I mean, Jason, what did he jump on it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, he jumped on it.  He reduced it, fired 10 percent of their staff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, that seems like an instant admission of kind of a failure.  I mean, it's kind of like saying, like, yeah, our content wasn't up to snuff.  Wasn't up to snuff enough for Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis and Mahalo President Jason  Rapp sent out a mass emailing saying, among other things, that Google's changes  have led to a significant dip in our traffic and revenue.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wonder if there's not something else going on there.  Is Jason wears the hair shirt well?  Yeah, you're right.  Is he now going to say, big bad Google is messing with me?  I'm not like those guys.  And he over, you know, he quickly he overreacted.  He's the king of overreaction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He may, in fact, have just used this as an excuse to do something.  He needed it and wanted to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's that.  I think this now gives him the ability to act like he's poor, poor Jason and to act  as if Google is the enemy of his business and he'll use this cynically and  opportunistically. Love you, Jason.  But, you know, it's what you do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, consider the source.  I think that's what you're saying.  We don't know, but consider the source.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And looks like a reason to switch  to more video content to make to kind of pivot a little bit, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And go, because the demand media is the number one contributor of video to YouTube.  Video is really what they do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's Jason's Jason and Jason say,  interestingly, the search site of Google has impacted us negatively.  Google's video unit, YouTube, continues to be our strong partner,  encouraging us to ramp up our video production and publish even more of our  expert video lessons. Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a pivot, Regina. You're right.  It's an opportunistic pivot. It's a pivot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it sounds like it could be.  I wonder if Google uses the data that they gather through Google Analytics to hope not  to check to see, you know, kind of how these algorithms change.  It's interesting, you know, because Google knows how a lot of these sites do  in their own search results because of you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be a breach of confidentiality if they're one hand is saying,  we know a lot of stuff about these sites.  You want to share that with Matt here?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hope they don't need to use analytics.  They can use AdSense.  A lot of these sites are serving Google ads and Google knows everything about

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it. I don't think they should be using that, should they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, why not?  Because in the sense that they need to know where ads perform.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, because if it got out, then people would say, I'm not going to use AdSense.  I'll be a partner with somebody else.  I don't want to have my site search results deprecated because of information.  Google has gleaned from us being a customer.  That's a boy. That's not so good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure it has to be addressed somewhere in the analytics terms of use.  It's just it's interesting to me that they, you know, that they do both website  traffic reporting and have such a big impact on what that would be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, if they were to combine all these  different information sources, they would absolutely know everything they need to  know, and maybe they have never said that they don't.  I don't know.  It would certainly make people stop using analytics and AdSense if they knew that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this is the kind of channel conflicts you get now.  It's a channel conflict, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But well, how do you handle that as a company?  Don't you build a firewall, a Chinese wall?  Don't you? Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's how right.  That's how you have to do it at this point.  I mean, Google Analytics is I mean, I hate the days of Webalizer and what was that  other really bad? I mean, I mean, Google Analytics is kind of so good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they bought Urchin and Urchin was very good and they bought it and incorporated it.  But there are other there's there are other goods.  I think Quantcast is actually.  Better, don't you?  I mean, those are numbers you can sell.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think. Yeah.  And that's in fact, I'm pretty sure that Gawker uses Quantcast now.  But I'm not sure how it works.  I mean, it's not do you embed a JavaScript bug?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Same thing. Same exact thing as analytics.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. It's not like a toolbar or an estimation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like Alexa or something.  No, no, no, no, no. Those are useless.  Yeah. No, it has to be direct measurement of visits.  Right. Speaking of which, at some point,  I want to talk to you about hash banks in the URLs.  Have you been following this discussion?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, only insofar as you have to recuse yourself because Gawker is a big hash  bank user. Yeah, they're a big hash bank user.  And it's making me crazy because I'm editing the Lifehacker book right now.  And all the URLs in the book actually have the hash bank in it.  It sort of offends my sense of URL ness.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is a show to talk about it, but I don't I don't want you to.  I don't want you. I don't want you to feel a conflict.  We could use Twitter. Twitter uses it to anybody who uses a lot of Ajax is using it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  GitHub uses it. Yep.  Yep. GitHub uses it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  GitHub apparently uses it intelligently, though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK, like they use it in issues for sure.  In the issue tracker, but maybe not in other places.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about that.  There's a new Google profile search.  I hope it makes profiles more usable, not less.  I'm a little worried that it's separate from Google itself.  But we'll talk about that and a lot more.  You're watching This Week in Google.  Google in the Cloud with Jeff Jarvis,  Gina Tripani brought to you today by Squarespace.  Great. Now, speaking of clouds, this is a cloud application for your website.  I guess all websites are cloud applications, but  the software for Squarespace and the hosting for Squarespace are both from  Squarespace and there's an advantage to doing it that way  because it's always up to date.  You don't have to even think about that.  That's just part of the deal as it comes up to date.  They have such control of the situation that they can throw more bandwidth at you.  They've got very, very sophisticated Java based virtual hosting and so  forth. It's just really nicely done.  These guys, Dane and Anthony, wrote this in college as a solution for themselves.  And now, of course, years later, it's become  a many agree the best solution for a website, for a content management system.  I want you to try it for free.  If you go to squarespace.com slash twig, it's very easy.  There's no credit card needed.  Just you name the site, you give it a password, an email address in case you  forget the password. You don't even have to type the password twice.  I love that.  And a little capture here.  And now for two weeks, you've got the full  benefit of Squarespace, the 60 plus designer templates that are so easy to  configure with just sliders and drag and drop.  Of course, if you're a CSS wizard or  JavaScript wizard, you could do the hash bangs.  You could do anything you need.  It's all in there.  That's the beauty of this squarespace.com slash twig, a great iPhone and iPad app.  Make it easy to not only post content, but to moderate comments, complete  integration with your social media network, importing and exporting.  You're never trapped from the major blog  APIs, including movable type WordPress, type ad and blogger.  They've got photo galleries, forums,  just everything you'd want in a simple point and click environment that makes you  look like a web pro. Just take a look at the examples.  You'll get some idea.  This is what big businesses are using,  individuals for their blogs,  charities,  anybody who needs a website and you really need a website.  Trust me, don't trust your don't trust your presence on the web to Facebook.  That'd be a mistake. Here's Kevin Pollock's site.  Here's our site.  Their Twip blog is a Squarespace site.  Look how fast that pops up.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  Give it a try today. You will love it.  So I don't know, should we get into this  hash bang thing, Gina, or is that really the weeds?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, we absolutely can.  I mean, I'm fine. I'm fine with it.  It's crazy. I'm actually reading a couple of some good blog posts.  Tim Bray kind of weighed in a few designers.  Listen, the reality is a URL should point to a piece of content and hash bang URLs  depend on JavaScript to fetch content, to load inside, which is what the Gawker  sites do. Gawker is a company I worked out for five years.  I own stock there.  That doesn't mean that I can't criticize them a little bit.  It's weird. It drives me a little crazy.  I think they're crazy.  I have not looked at their Google Analytics  in a really long time, so I'm not sure how it affected their SEO.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's apparently got a way around it, but it's kind of a kludgy way around it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand why you wouldn't just, you know, if you're a  content publisher, why your URL wouldn't just be a regular string with the words  of your headline in it, you know, which is what Lifehacker and the other Gawker  sites URLs used to be. I mean, that just seems like good practice.  It's just straightforward.  I think it was Twitter that started this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if I go to Twitter.com slash Gina Trapani, watch what happens.  It transforms itself to the hash bang.  Twitter.com slash pound sign exclamation.  That's called a hash bang slash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hash bangification of the web.  Well, it's just like it's really like the web application of the web.  So the hash bang on Twitter came started when they did the new Twitter redesign,  which is very like iPad web appy like.  You tap and that side panel flies out.  It's much more kind of Ajax.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you could do this in HTML five without a hash bang with real URLs.  That's the I guess the what it is.  I think it's mostly no dot JS that people are using.  Everybody loves no dot JS.  Developers love it.  So what it means is when you go to Twitter.com, the browser actually.  Doesn't get Gina Trapani's content, it gets a big ass chunk of JavaScript,  which it runs locally on your machine and that generates the page.  Right. Get fetching bits of these are all different bits of content.  So there is no Twitter.com slash Gina Trapani.  It doesn't exist.  And that's what part of the difficulty with with Google is.  There's no page for them to index and Google's spiders don't run JavaScript.  So there's a kind of doesn't that hurt that doesn't that hurt Gawker at some  point, you'd think, but Google does apparently some sort of work around that

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  makes it possible. I mean, from a developer point of view,  it's attractive, right, because it's the separation of content and presentation  that you're getting.  I assume that it's Jason or XML, probably most likely Jason and then and then  showing itself. And I'm actually I really haven't counted this.  I'm not sure what Google's doing to see those pages.  It seems it seems strange that that that you know, you'd want to depend on a Google  kind of work around.  It's very inside baseball.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But if you have lately noticed, for instance, not unusual for me to go to  Twitter and get a blank page, that's because something's gone wrong.  I've got the chunk of JavaScript and it didn't or whatever Facebook.  It happens to me all the time.  Facebook's same. It's using hash bangs as well.  And so there is a side effect and reliability and performance.  There's definitely a side effect in indexing and you and URLs no longer really  refer to content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing, I think.  MSNBC has said that they're they're going away from pages, pages.  Right. Well, everybody is the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As you said, the web app of application.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's a window.  It's a it's a TV screen.  It's a whatever. And stuff just comes on to it.  Right. And that's where we go.  And, you know, that's OK.  But so much of the architecture of how we do the web, including the commerce of the  web and things like that, is based on pages.  Should it be? That's a different question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I just push to, you know, that you want to be able to push content and get  autorefreshing someone in the in the chat room helpfully gave us gave me the link  to making Ajax applications crawlable.  If you Google that, that that's the document for how Google works around this.  But you basically instruct the Google bot.  This is an Ajax application.  And here's how to get the content, which which makes sense.  But yes, the URLs driving crazy.  I'm not a big fan of the hash bang.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I  just started discovering this whole discussion about this on the web.  And I thought, well, I thought I'd like to bring it up and just raise  people's awareness of it and probably to inside baseball for us to discuss.  Nevertheless, I think fascinating.  And maybe at another time we need a web  developer show so we could talk about stuff like this.  I would point people to Chris Shifflett's blog, which is H.S.H.A.  has a bunch of S.H.I.F.  L.E.T.T. dot org.  And he has a good article on this linking to all of the big  articles, including Tim Bray's article  about this.  And  it basically violates Postel's law,  which is be conservative in what you give and liberal in what you accept.  And fascinating.  I think it's fascinating, but enough of that.  What about this new profile search?  So Google has a profile search engine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google, Google operating system  uncovered this, which is a great blog for all sorts of Google product tips.  They found that there's a way to search  Google profiles if you add a URL parameter.  Right. So this isn't so the profile search  isn't exposed in Google's interface right now, but likely it will be.  Right. This is usually how they kind of start to roll these things out.  If you add.  So what is the the query is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you go to Google dot com slash profile slash you slash zero question mark.  And then the query is specified by Q equals in the query.  For instance, if I do Q equals Leo, I'll find all the profiles of people  with the name Leo, right, including mine at the top there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's a people search.  The meaning of another kind of happened to Google me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this part of a Google me?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not really sure what's going on with Google me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's as fabled as HTML five taking over the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like Duke Nukem forever.  It's just it's imaginary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I think from what I understand, the last I heard about it is  Google me is just is not really a single standalone Google me product.  It's just these these slow and steady social like improvements.  Right. Like this, like this ability to search profiles.  Right. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I think it goes back to what Denny, I think I think I don't know if  we're going to talk about this separately, but Facebook's comment,  distributed comment structure to the Disqus Disqus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love Disqus. I use Disqus.  Yeah. Right. Is Facebook using Disqus now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Facebook's competing with Disqus.  Oh, are they?  You can embed Facebook comments.  Never.  Yes. Which means that when you go to the site, you can see just the comments  of your friends, they are prioritized differently.  You can, they have a support ability that you can put them on Facebook  and share your comments somewhere else, which is kind of nice.  Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, so what that means is Facebook steps closer to be  in the identity structure of the web, which they've always wanted.  They've always wanted to be.  And I've argued that there's some danger there because you've got to know what's  happening with what you do out on the web and how it relates to what happens  inside Facebook. But having said that, they're just comments.  Right.  And if you're putting them out on the open web, they're on the open web.  So now you can have a new ability to not only sign in with Facebook,  but share via Facebook and I think most importantly, get the social benefits  of comments. So it means you can see only people who sign with Facebook  and have real identities, which presumably will improve the civility  of the comments, which is the big issue with comments.  And you can also get the social value  so that you see comments prioritized for you.  If I got all this right, that's a big deal.  And that beats search and profile pages.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does. Basically, as a publisher, you give up your ability to host  the conversations about your own content and your own database for all the sort  of sticky social things that Facebook offers, which is, you know,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  if you do it now with Disqus, which is great.  Right, Gina. But this now adds things to it that poor Disqus can't do  because it's not Facebook. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I use a similar system, JSKits Echo, which does the same thing.  It pulls in from Facebook and all the others.  But boy, when Facebook does it, the problem is Facebook's not going to support  all the other stuff. It's going to be Facebook.  Right.  Like Disqus and then JSKit Echo will give you Twitter.  We'll give you. So it's great because if you write a blog post, tweet it.  All the comments from Twitter are pulled in.  All the comments for Facebook are pulled in. I love that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And that's the thing.  Right. That's the thing that's going to differentiate anyone else from  anyone else's offering from Facebook.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the if you go to  Inside Facebook, for example, or SB Nation, you'll see it in operation.  So inside Facebook.com and then go to a post there.  And at the bottom, it just says, leave a reply.  And it's a Facebook box. It's so familiar.  There it is. It's Facebook.  Add a comment.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  As a dumb developer, my first reaction was, why would any publisher do this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I could tell you why.  But yeah, it drives traffic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Drives traffic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can drive traffic back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So where is it that I go down below the ads?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, look, there's my Facebook picture.  It knows me. You're logged in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, crap.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep. Now, if I add a comment, does that also go in my face?  Yeah.  I see post to Facebook. You have the option.  Yep. But that's why they do it, because then my Facebook friends see my comment.  Maybe you're driven back to this page.  It drives traffic.  And we know the like button drives huge amounts of traffic.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I'm one of the ones who made fun of like and said, oh, who wants to do that?  And that's going to, you know,  smoke on me the way I run the web. Now I was wrong.  So now they've got the like button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've got the activity feed plugin.  They've got recommendations, the like box, the login button,  the registration button, the face pile button, the comments button and the live.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the really important thing, Gene.  I think there was a why why else publishers would do it is that one of the huge  problems, it's a big cost for publishers to have to manage comments.  And this kind of handles spam automatically, right?  Because not only that, but also you have to have an identity.  I mean, Facebook's bloodstream, you know,  they wouldn't even change their rules for a while.  Ghanim from Google when he had the fake identity to do the page.  And they had to find somebody else who was sympathetic to the cause to have them  be the host of it because Google Facebook is not going to get off the real identity  nor should they, I think, get off Facebook.  That's what they are.  And that has so that brings value back  to the publisher in terms of improving the civility and reducing the cost  and improving the engagement people have with their site.  It's brilliant.  Brilliant. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. But can publishers export or get  access to all the comments specifically related to their content?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hold on, Jada. Why would they?  In 10 years, has publishers done anything with their comments?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, but they should be right.  This is a community who's saying things about what they're doing.  Like, what's the point of having a community if you're not going to do  anything with the conversations that they're having around your stuff?  I don't think anyone is doing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it really is a question then of why you do comments, why you do community.  Is it to drive more traffic to get more engagement or is it because you care  what people say and I would guess in many cases it's the former.  You don't really care what people are saying.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should care what people say.  If you care about your community, you care.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're so old fashioned.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I agree with you 100 percent.  That's the only way in the long run.  Absolutely right. But they don't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've had 10 years to do it.  Comments. I dealt with comments all the time and we are publishers.  I lectured them and told them to do comments and all that.  And I hate them. They hate comments.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But this is the difference between the  D-bags and the people who care about the web.  Well, guess what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The D-bags are here, baby.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, they totally aren't.  I think they should embed Facebook comments.  I think everyone else should maybe also but also be worried about ways or be  concerned about ways to get that data and do something more with that data to  respond to their community and figure out how to engage people a little more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I've resisted putting like buttons and tweet buttons on our content.  You need to stupidly, foolishly for that very reason, Gina.  I don't want the Facebook bookification of the Internet.  But of course, it's home to the light.  I know I'm dumb and I'm doing my Zuckerberg imitation.  By doing so, I'm actually hurting you guys.  This is hurting me now.  He's stuck. I think he's stuck.  Because that's.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, this is where we are now.  You know, and Gina,  another view I have of comments is that I was always religious about how  sites should have comments, this relationship is and blah, blah, blah.  And I came to see that I was wrong to this extent.  Comments by their very architecture in content, at least say to the public,  you know, we don't want to hear from you until after we're done.  And after we're done, we will deign to allow you to comment on our work.  Yeah. And you know what?  You know what? We're going to go to the bar.  We really we don't care what you have to say.  We're going to come back and we're going to see all the broken glass and we're  going to say, see, the people are bozos.  Whereas true collaboration means you move people up the chain.  You collaborate much earlier in the process and you say, what should I be  doing today? What do you want me to do?  What do you want to know? What do you know?  Yes, let's work together. Right.  All of that. That does not happen out of comments.  That's going to happen in other structures and other ways that you that you do  things collaboratively together.  So the spirit of collaboration,  I think that that got kind of  not even collaboration, the idea that a relationship was formed, was formed  badly in comments, and I blame publishers for doing that.  And I'm not sure that I fully should have.  I certainly should to some extent.  But again, the architecture of comments is wrong.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I totally agree with that for the fact point that you just made.  But I do think that Twitter and Facebook are places where you can ask before you  write the story, respond to people during the writing of the story, post the story  and then collect the comments after the story.  And yes, that there's that there's the one writer.  Right. But you still have the community  engaged around and I've done this and we do it on Lifehacker.  I just I feel like this whole like I don't know when you treat your community just  like eyeballs and not like humans who are part of the collaboration.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I think another way to look at this is I have never said this before.  So I'll regret this in 10 minutes.  I almost wonder whether you kill comments.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got to think Nick, I have and on some of our content, I don't write content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the problem is that I have I condemned that before.  I said that was chicken and you're not  investing in the community, you're not doing this, you're not doing that.  Well, maybe there are now better tools to truly interact.  Right. Like IRC and like maybe Facebook and certainly like Twitter.  Yeah. Right.  Twitter is a good satisfaction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just don't want to have comments right under the shows because there were all  these trolls who would say bad things about the shows.  And then I felt like people would go  to the shows and see the bad comments and never listen.  So I've moved them elsewhere in effect.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right.  I mean, listen, this is why I love Wave so much, right?  Because Wave was all about collaboration from start to finish.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If if all users were  part as much part of the community, that wouldn't be so bad.  But you got there's not just D bag content creators, there's D bag users too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's the other problem is that is that not to get way high  at the altitude and low in the oxygen, you know, what I say to people is that we  in media, God like in our own image, see the the Internet as a medium.  And so we think that when people leave  nasty comments, they've schmutzed it all and ruined it.  Right. And it's not it's it's it's the streets of New York.  Right. There are bozos in the streets of New York.  The Internet is life.  Ergo, there are going to be bozos in the Internet.  And and you just have to realize that and work with that and  put the investment in to have the right interactions at the right time with people  in ways that truly matter and give them respect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you know, speaking for big media companies, it can be challenging because  if you have a large audience, it's not it's not trivial to interact.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very expensive.  There are companies, you know, there's one called Live Nation or  like the live world  that has been doing this for years of having people, you know, police the  comments that you have to invest, because if you don't, you're showing no respect  to the community either if you don't get rid of the bozos.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. But this is the thing, you can't be.  But when you have a business that's based around making content,  it's not about hiring police like you have to change your whole  your business is having a conversation and engaging in community people on the web.  When you're on the web, you're about communicating with people.  You're not about publishing articles.  So I totally see your point, Jeff, about comments after the fact being sort of  useless and maybe we can just get into Facebook because they are sort of useless  because there is someone just from on high posting and then they have to hire all  these people to like delete the trolls.  But but you can't you can't look at it that way.  I mean, the publications that are going to win or publications that are about  having conversations with their readers and engaging readers the whole way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You are preaching to the choir, Reverend Gina.  Absolutely. Yeah, totally.  I absolutely agree.  But in practicality, what happens is I when I was running local  sites, NJ.com and OregonLive.com and all those and we had the comments,  we had the problems you have, I thought that what we needed was every  forum that those days it was forums, not comments way back in the day.  And I thought we needed to hire moderators.  We hired moderators, right.  And it worked. And then I hired this really good social guy named Mark.  And he said, no, Jarvis, you're all wrong here.  That's like saying that you want the mayor who should be kissing babies to be out  there cleaning up the garbage.  You did it. There are people who are going to come in.  We're just going to schmutz the space and you got to deal with it.  If you don't invest in that and deal with that, then everybody's going to hate you  for it. You got to do that.  You have to have a cleanup crew for the bozos.  That's not the heart of your interaction with your public.  Right. That's an obligation that comes.  So you can have good interaction with your public because you can't just assume  that the bozos will disappear on their own.  That's right. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That makes sense.  I'm with you. They're functions.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're functions. Right.  So back to Facebook.  So Facebook, by having real identity and having the ability as a user to prioritize  my friends, if I'm in a place like Huffington or SP Nation, if I were a Knicks fan  in there, then I could see my friends and that takes care a lot of that function.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. So Facebook gives you the facility with the cleaning crew built in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  To some extent, it turns it around.  Rather than cleaning, it merely, OK, let's metaphor time.  It brings you to the room with your friends in it automatically.  It's Klaish-Shirky's filter failure.  It's Klaish.  It's a new kind of filter.  Rather than playing whack-a-mole with the bad people, what you do is you promote the  good, which is a better model, I think.  Right. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's why we're all going to have Facebook comments on our pages.  Yes, we are.  Damn it.  I'm going to set this up on my blog right after.  Damn it.  I'll put Facebook.  You know what?  As an experiment, we should try that on the Twitter page because that's where I  that's the place I turned off comments.  I have comments on my blog and everywhere else.  But on the Twitter page, maybe I'll turn them on, see what happens.  Why am I going to regret that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We got to take it.  OK, one second.  The press release I got from David Swain at Facebook for publishers, easy to  implement distribution, moderation controls, higher engagement for users,  authentic commenting and social context.  See the best of comments first.  Moderation and spam control.  Take the conversation farther.  Threaded comments and comment as page.  That's pretty compelling.  Page owners can comment on external sites as their Facebook page.  I think we're logged into Facebook.  You'll see the option to comment as your page to come out.  We shared on your page as well.  Blah, blah, blah.  So that's what they built here rather quietly.  I think I think it's a big deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very compelling.  In fact, it's exactly what I want.  And I'll probably turn it on this afternoon on the TV page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, you know, if Gina can buy an iPad, you can use Facebook.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know this is just this is this whole episode is about turncoats.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have to take a break and get our tooltip a number of the week.  Before we do, though, a couple of quick hits.  First of all, apparently Facebook raises  self-esteem in a study, 63 students who looked at Facebook, a mirror or nothing  for three minutes.  The Facebook group was only allowed to surf their pages and tabs, not their  friends after each student took a self-esteem questionnaire.  Those who study their Facebook reported  having higher self-esteem, those who stared at nothing or the mirror.  No change.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How clever am I?  It's the it's the witch, isn't it?  And you're on the wall.  Who's the coolest of them all?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The honeycomb statue has arrived at the lawn on Google Google's campus.  That means honeycomb is coming soon.  This is a good one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is what I want.  Is the bee going to kill the poor little Android guy?  He does look a little terrified.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It looks a little menacing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting that Steve  Jobs in the the iPad launch today used that bee to stand in for honeycomb in all  of his critiques of Android.  I thought that was kind of I mean, boy,  Apple's not slow to pick up on semiotics.  They see the bee is threatening, too.  We're going to take a break.  Come back in just a second with any other quick things we want to get in here.  There's so much stuff.  Have you updated Gingerbreaded?  Have you gotten it yet, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I have. I did not wait for the over the air.  You did it manually.  I did the manual.  As soon as I heard it was the official zip file, I did it manually.  I couldn't stop myself.  And I like it.  It's it's it's nice.  It's darker, smoother.  There isn't anything that's like standout marquee about it that I'm like head over  heels for, but it's definitely a nice, a nice little upgrade.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're just happy about that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, finally, finally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And and you can be reassured there will be, in fact, no Charlie Sheen talk today.  On the other hand, we might mention the Oscars.  I don't know.  Were you happy, sad?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  About the Oscars or about Sheen?  Sad about Sheen?  No, I don't know.  We can say who's winning?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  my face is melting.  All right, let's take a break.  Come back with more Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.  This week in Google Tech News today coming up in just a moment before we go there.  I want to mention fresh books dot com a great way.  If you're a freelancer or a small business person or sole proprietor to do your  invoicing, it's always a hassle.  It's the thing I hated doing so much till I found Fresh Books back in 2004.  That's when I started using them.  It's a website that lets you do your invoicing.  On the web, but it makes it easier for you to get paid.  And I kind of like that notion.  If you go to Fresh Books dot com, you'll see you can sign up for free for up to  three clients. So it's a good way to get started.  If you want paper invoices sent, they will do it for an additional fee.  Your logo goes on the invoice.  But once you send out an invoice via email,  your clients can pay you via credit card, PayPal or 11 other electronic payment  services. That just means you get paid faster and easier.  They will also do things like tickle you  when you haven't gotten paid automatically, automated late payment reminders.  If you invoice by the hour, if you do time tracking and billing,  you can log your hours.  They have an iPhone app or on the web and then consolidate those time  sheets right into the invoice with the push of a button.  I two million people use Fresh Books to do their invoicing.  I use it for a long time now.  Of course, I have a pretty large staff.  It cost me a lot more.  I really liked Fresh Books and I think you will, too.  If you are doing your own invoicing,  I want you to go to FreshBooks.com and try it today.  Painless billing.  Gina Tripani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Casa Web Albums does not.  Yeah, they do not.  They just changed their calculation for how they calculate how much storage space  you've used. They do not count small images.  So images under 800 pixels wide or videos shorter than 15 minutes.  Don't get counted toward your storage quota usage.  So if you haven't looked at the Casa Web Albums in a while,  there's also a front page change.  They kind of they list your friends' photos.  They're trying to make this a little more of a  just trying to improve the photo  sharing capability.  So there's a new front page update,  but they do not count 800 pixel wide photos and videos.  So that's cool.  Go ahead and upload your archives there,  the Pocoska Web Albums.  I'm not quite convinced to leave Flickr yet, but I'm getting there.  I really like the way the Casa Web Albums is integrated into Android.  It's much easier to share images in PWA via Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they show up in your gallery, which is really great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is really nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, I'm a big fan of this.  And you're right.  I mean, I wish it would kind of become as big as Flickr,  because I'd love to use this instead of Flickr.  Yes.  And I paid for more.  You know, I paid for like hundreds of gigs.  I don't know how much storage I have, but I really I've always liked this.  It's cool stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it cooks right into the desktop of Casa, which I love with the facial  recognition. It's a good product.  And this little change, this algorithm change has made me kind of take a look at it.  If you don't pay for the extra storage, you could you can send a lot of photos up  there at a smaller resolution and without without using up your space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Your number of the week, Mr.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jarvis, well, I'll tell you, it will not be that Charlie Sheen is about to hit a  million followers. Is he really?  Yeah. Yeah.  I already.  I heard sixty five thousand eight hundred fifteen.  Well, he is winning.  I wrote a post. He's winning.  I wrote a post complaining about how I think that he was used by  press who put him on as if he wasn't sick or did have a problem.  And they enabled that.  But, you know, he we the people are doing it.  We're following on Facebook.  We're giving them plenty of attention on Facebook, on Twitter.  So when did he join yesterday?  Yesterday, yesterday.  Now, Howard Stern hasn't risen so fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Transcript:  So that's not my number. What is your number?  A number is number two.  Bing is now number two worldwide.  But don't get excited.  Google's global market share in February was eighty nine point ninety four.  Bing's was four point thirty seven.  Yahoo is three point ninety three.  And of course, Yahoo is Bing.  So it adds up. OK.  But Yahoo losing, you know, isn't necessarily a good thing for Bing.

I don't know if you're familiar with food spotting,  but it's a social network that is is about checking into restaurants,  most particularly checking into food stuffs at restaurants.  So you take a picture of a meal you liked, you can add nom nom noms.  It's nice now because tied into the phone, you can see where you are  and you can see what's good around here.  So these are these are this is food that's nearby.
