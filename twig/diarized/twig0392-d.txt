Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was waiting for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be Google, but now it's anything we want to talk about.  Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT.  I have a lot of questions for you.  IOT has been big in the news this week.  And you're always.  We may have answers.  Yeah, you're always keeping up on what's going on with these little devices we're  hooking up in our house.  Well, I'll ask you a question in a second.  But let me introduce Jeff Jarvis, who's also here from the City University of New  York taking a snow day.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we got a very thoughtful letter about the show that someone who complained that  we've gotten too far away from Google.  I meant to respond to him.  I forgot.  Whoever it is, if you're watching, I think it was very thoughtful and smart.  We were never all about Google.  No, we were.  There's probably kind of some measure of Google we can come back to, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were even in the earliest days.  It was about Google and the cloud.  And notice our logo is a puffy little cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think I think we have to include.  I think it's platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which meant Google, Facebook and Twitter.  Yes, yes, yes.  So but I didn't want to do a social media show.  We actually had a social media show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You tried that.  It oddly didn't.  There wasn't.  What was to say about Facebook?  I don't know of itself.  Yeah, I think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that I prefer what we do, which is the impact of Google, Facebook and Twitter  on real life.  And I think we pretty much stick to that.  There's been a little politics leaking in.  But you know what?  I defy you to walk down the street, any street in America, not have a little politics leaps  sneak in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the New York Times just I was on the home page and they said 13 stories that  have nothing to do with politics.  And I was like, oh, click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people.  I think that's not unusual.  A lot of people, including my wife, are saying, can we do you know, let's just take a break  from all the politics.  But if you look at you could do that.  But if you look at the top stories in the New York Times, they're all about politics,  because people do want to read this stuff.  And we're not going to this.  We don't.  This is not a show about politics, but it's inevitably going to leak in a little bit.  A, because there is an excess of politics and tech, but but B, because we're human.  And we're going to talk about the things that are on our top of our mind.  But let me ask you, Stacey, about I finally, yes, it was on Valentine's Day.  And I left the room briefly and I came back to my wife yelling, saying, can we get a GD  television system that I can use?  I can't I just want to watch Netflix.  How?  How?  So I you know, this is a challenge, because I have a fairly complex home theater system,  several of them.  My man cave is worse.  The one in the living room is is a little more straightforward, but it has an AV receiver.  It has Netflix.  It has an Apple TV.  It has a Blu-ray player slash PlayStation.  It has and a television set.  And it's kind of complicated.  And you have to know while Netflix is on the Roku.  So you go to the Roku for that or you go to the Apple TV for that.  You could watch Netflix on the Panasonic television, but it's not as good.  You know, that kind of thing.  So I finally and tell me if I made a mistake.  I said, all right, give up.  I'm buying a Harmony Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I just bought one last like yesterday.  It's coming tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just like in sync, aren't we?  I it's a little spooky.  Soon I'm menstruating at the same time.  No, I'm kidding.  Joking.  Cut that out.  Cut that out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Wrong kind of thing.  Kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So still, still, that's there.  Both of us like this and me going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I do you think now I've had before Harmony ones, I've had a variety of Harmony  remotes and it never really worked well for me.  So is so tell me about the hub because it could do it with the echo, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so I tried the hub like when it first came out, that was like two years ago and  I brought it in and it was awesome for AV because you can do the complicated stuff like  set time delays, which may or may not be the most effective.  May or may not matter for you.  But like my receiver takes a second to be like, hold on a second.  No, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of them do because they have to handshake and know what they got out with the boot and  handshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the whole.  Yeah, I don't even know what's happening.  So it was great for that.  So the reason I bought it is because now I'm because I'm so incredibly lazy.  I want to say.  Echo turned on my Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I want Lisa to be able to do.  She should be able to say Echo watch Netflix in the living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that is what I think is going to happen.  So I've got to set that up.  Talk to me next week because it comes tomorrow.  Mine comes.  That's what I'm saying.  There you go.  So I'm.  Well, we could be like, did it work?  Because I didn't buy the remote.  And you see this one.  This is Cavos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's beautiful.  But so expensive.  The nice thing about the Harmony Hub is it's not expensive.  It's like 100 bucks, right?  Yeah, it's 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you get the remote, it's more expensive.  I don't want the remote because you use your smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to use the Echo.  Or the Echo.  We'll see what happens.  Again, this is this is why I bought it because I'm like, by golly, it's too good not to buy.  Dr. Mom has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says that's how I do it.  You should also have a tablet around for things like volume control because you can't do that by voice commands.  But that's what Dr.  Mom's one of the reasons I got it is because of you, Dr.  Mom.  You're always saying, oh, you know, I could talk to my TV and that would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you could do the Echo thing with volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you can.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she says keep a tablet around so you can.  Well, I'll just leave a tablet like on the living room.  That's actually I haven't.  I'm going to show this a little later on.  But that would be, you know, I almost always have a laptop in front of the TV anyway, especially  from watching like the Grammys or the Oscars or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you leave it in another room and then you can't do anything unless you go get it, that's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm going to dedicate this Chromebook because it's a tablet as well, an Android tablet.  And this will be a wonderful living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, my wife would hate that being that all the time.  Yeah, I guess your wife has no choice and your husband no choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know what I would probably like to do?  I want something.  Here's the dream scenario.  It's too expensive right now.  But I want an old phone that has inductive charging on it so I can just put it in a nice little container on a side table because otherwise the phone is going to constantly need charging.  And that's a good idea.  That's a really good point.  I have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I always have leftover stuff.  I could do that too.  Does it have inductive charging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's the key is not having to plug in your freaking remote.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let me show you the inductive charger.  You should get the tilt.  Tell me.  Yeah.  And I have a couple and I really love them.  It's you know, it's the Qi wireless charging.  This is tylt.com is the company and they make a cradle.  Where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty.  It's right there.  You see it?  Is that is that it?  This thing?  Well, let me click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is it right here.  The view.  V U umlaut.  Thirty dollars.  And so you just put your phone on that.  And the nice thing about it is it's kind of naturally positioned.  Comes in a variety of colors to fit your decor.  As long as your decor is orange, green or bright blue.  But no, I really, I really like this.  It works really well.  And you just sit there.  You have to have a wireless phone.  Obviously, wireless charging.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm now going to be paying, let's say, a hundred bucks for the Logitech Harmony.  Thirty bucks for the charger.  I've got an old phone that may or I may have to buy a little charging case.  We'll call that 30 bucks.  So now I'm a hundred and sixty bucks so I can talk to my TV.  It's worth it.  Oh, I'm such a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is your.  Hey, little hint for you.  It's all tax deductible.  So, yes, the good news is the taxpayers help foot the bill.  I feel I feel much better now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacy on IOT.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I will.  I will put it on my business account.  But I'm like, oh, this may be silly.  I'm fully acknowledging that it may be silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's really odd is we both did it within 24 hours of one another.  It is.  But it was Valentine's Day that did it for me and just the pain.  And I felt I felt really bad because, you know, I've written I wrote up a manual.  It's like eight pages.  And that's the simple by the way.  That's the simple one.  Go in my office.  You know, I'm the only one who knows how to do that.  Does it make you feel powerful?  No, it's makes me frustrated.  I don't like.  And the and the worst thing is nowadays TVs because of this thing called CEC, every device as it wakes up and says hello takes over the TV.  So I have to sit and wait on the TV goes.  What? Oh, you.  Oh, you want to talk.  Wait a minute.  No, you want to talk. Oh, you want to talk.  And I can I can overrule.  It doesn't matter.  I just have to wait till it goes through devices.  And then so 30 seconds later, I could say, OK, go back to the TV now.  It's terrible.  We this has to be a universal problem or nearly universal.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like complicated TV setups.  Yeah.  I mean, I remember like 15 years ago when I was going over to people's houses to babysit their kids and they would be like, and here this is how you work the television.  And they would hand me the instruction manual.  And that was just because they had multiple receivers and game console.  They were fancy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and they were ahead of the head of the times.  So moving on to stuff other people care about.  Well, let me mention another thing I bought that I'm going to say, don't buy whatever you do.  The Android 2.0 watch the LG sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the fancy one or the less fancy?  Well, LTE or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got the one with LTE, but Florence Ion got the style.  And that's the simpler one and much more attractive.  And frankly, the only one that's at all comfortable.  The sport.  So it's wearing a pancake.  Oh, it first of all, it was worse than that, Jeff, because it's thick, because it has GPS and LTE in it.  And it's going to give you wrist cancer for all that.  Who knows?  The sport has its own phone number, so I can not only receive calls like a place calls and and because it but here's one good thing that Apple one thing that the Apple watch can't do that they can do.  It can also stream Google Music so you don't have to have music on the watch.  You can listen to your Google stations via LTE.  You'll pay for all of this, of course.  If you have AT&T, you can connect.  You can share it with your phones so you have to pay for another account phone number.  Pay 10 bucks a month for it.  I think not because you're using the same phone number as your phone.  So there's a sync thing, but I pay 10 bucks a month because I have a dedicated phone number for it.  Ridiculous.  You know, I just don't see that.  GPS heart rate monitor.  That's not as great as the Apple watch or a Fitbit.  It's kind of OK.  But the worst thing is the antennas.  It's ugly as sin.  It's slate gray and the band is it cannot be removed because the antennas are in the band going about halfway down your wrist.  That means that part is inflexible.  You kind of see it when you look at that picture right there.  That bump.  It's kind of an odd curve.  That's fixed.  It's a hard, solid antenna up and down, bottom and top and bottom.  And so it's just not comfortable.  It doesn't conform to the wrist very well.  What about the sport?  That's sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The style is fine, but it loses the LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It loses the GPS, which is fine.  I don't want any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I you know what I did today?  What?  What are you wearing?  I got a new battery in my plain old watch.  Good for you.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frankly, that's fine.  It's fine.  I'm not a big fan of smartwatches.  I like regular wristwatches a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is it's a social problem.  I did like not having to pull out the phone and see an alert or whatever, but I looked  like I was rude every time.  Oh, you're oh, you're tired of talking to me.  You're looking at your watch.  No, I'm checking the message.  Not enough.  That is also rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in the middle of a conversation with someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the hell with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not only not only that, but I find I end up pulling out the phone anyway.  I look at the watch.  I see.  Oh, there's a message.  Let me get the phone.  It's like, yeah, it's double the worse.  It's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only like it because my phone's never my phone's usually in my purse or my bag.  So I like having I don't actually want to see the message necessarily, but I like knowing  that a certain type of message came in.  Yeah.  So that's practical.  Yeah.  But that's the only and I have a ring for that.  So.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pah Pah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pah Pah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pah Pah Pah Pah Pah Pah.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do miss having a watch.  Do you.  I just stopped wearing various fitness trackers.  I may get a charge, but I they weren't doing anything for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, I do like fitness trackers mostly because it gives me some peer pressure.  And that's where the Apple Watch.  Apple Watch excels because you share, you get your rings, you see, you know, you kind  of graphically quickly how you're doing and then you see how your friends are doing.  And like Renee Richie now sends donuts when you complete a workout because he's Canadian.  And like Jim Horton donuts, they look like Tim Horton's.  You can't eat them unless you have to.  You'd have to eat your wash.  They're on your watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the most depressing kind of donut ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes you want a donut, but you can't have it.  No, I find that makes me want to work out.  OK.  You're not that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm so contrary.  Any any gamification efforts just piss me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, that's why you don't have a boss.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is why I started my business.  I didn't want anyone to tell me what to do because some people and I think you're like  this.  Somebody tells you do something.  You do the other thing.  You're the opposite, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is how I got a tongue ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That took my breath away.  Your mother, your mother said, Stacey, do not know my my boyfriend's soon to be husband

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at the time was like, you're not going to do that.  I was like, oh, don't you tell me what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not your host.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your boyfriend's soon to be husband at the time.  Yes, I don't have one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I took it out.  This was when I was younger.  You took your husband out.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he buried in that backyard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's buried in the common area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She kept Andrew, but she got rid of the time ring.  That's one advantage of piercings, though, is you could take them out and make things  kind of mostly grow back.  They do.  Now we really have gone afar from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have a numb spot in the tongue?  No, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you've got it, you talk like that, didn't you?  Come on, tell the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was like three days of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a terrible thing to do.  It's very risky, too.  But did you get so did you get a stud or a ring?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A stud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's in the middle of your tongue.  Yes, a stud.  Oh, OK, but let's hey, you know what?  Google laid off a bunch of people.  You should have listened to Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  And he still married you after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What can I say?  He's he's a smart man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a smart man.  All right.  Google laid off people with no, that's not true, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They reallocated people because they have a new CEO in their fiber division.  Oh, the fiber is this is this part of the rundown?  I should have looked at the rundown more closely.  No, bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. It's depressing because I'm surprised they're even doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well, they're here.  Here, I've got too many too many tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're doing more fiber.  We talked about this on Sunday because one of our panelists, Jason Heiner, lives in Louisville, which was upgraded from a potential to an upcoming.  And we had thought the fiber had was like frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not well, they're doubling down on wires.  So as I scroll to find the story, have you found the story yet?  Because I'm sucking.  Google fiber.  I started looking up Logitech Harmony stuff instead.  OK, names do boss shed staff USA Today.  So it was Craig Bart or Bartlett Barrett.  Barrett was Barrett Barrett Barrett rather left.  Yeah, he left.  Now they have a guy named Gregory October.  It was and they had nobody kind of in charge at the time.  But now they've got Gregory McCrae, who I don't know who he is.  I'm looking.  But they have let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going up against AT&T in the cities where AT&T says they're going to roll out fiber.  Google has started to roll it out.  But I think a lot of this Jason called it fiber to the press release instead of fiber to the curb.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I were to the premise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, not premise.  No press release.  Well, it's all about appearances and less about anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I called AT&T's efforts originally.  But well, not their first ones, which were in Austin, because those are actually happening.  But a lot of their other cities that they announced not getting anything right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McCrae came from Aero communications.  Greg.  Greg, Greg McCrae came from Aero communications.  Is that not the arrow that was doing the local antenna arrow?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it is.  Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was area, not arrow.  That was area.  OK.  And Google is also losing hundreds of employees while moving them to positions, other positions.  There won't be any layoffs.  So they'll be reabsorbed into the into the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, this is Aero communications, which was the the was area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so maybe business insider spelled it wrong.  Steve Kovach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a real good question, because USA Today has it.  Aero communications.  But there is also an arrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do do do.  Well, there's Greg McCrae, who is the with the Boston Celtics.  That's not him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me go to it.  Let me go to Bloomberg story because Mark Bergens usually really good.  Gregory McCrae.  He is.  He called.  He spelled it correctly.  Aero communications.  It's not area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a different.  It's not area.  No, according to USA Today.  Sorry, USA Today.  He was the CEO of Aero communications, CEO of a Cal Energy, Antonova Limited, piping  hot networks.  And he is on the board of directors at Info GPS, a leading provider of cyber security  and compliance management.  I don't know.  This just sounds like some guy.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some guy who's got experience in telecom.  Now, it says several hundred employees are moving over to Alphabet's main Google business,  according to a person familiar with the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the real question here is how committed is Google to fiber?  We thought they weren't because they because of all the transitions and layoffs.  And yet they announced this week that they're going to move into Louisville and then and  then they've hired a new CEO.  So what is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when they bought Webpass, I thought that was going to be their way of doing fixed in  a fixed mobile wireless.  Yes, but you could do it.  You could also do it in commercial settings where Google Fiber actually might be better  off.  You it's a lot cheaper than laying actual fiber in the ground.  So that's what I thought would end up happening, because it's just a better market strategy.  Consumers are stuck with contracts.  Consumers.  Most consumers are like, what am I going to do with the gig?  I'll just stick with AT&T.  It's fine.  So it's a little pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the AT&T gigabit is eighty dollars.  I guess that's not pricey compared to cable.  But our our provider here, Sonic Net, charges forty for gigabit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because Dane is a good guy who's not trying to screw his customers over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google is?  Well, Google, Google charges forty two, as I remember, at forty as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think they launched fiber.  I think it was like seventy five in.  But you got TV with that.  I believe so.  So yes, in AT&T and AT&T and Comcast and all those guys, all they're trying to do is keep you at a hundred and fifty dollar ARPU.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the strategy as they see people moving away from premium cable subscriptions to over the top.  They increase the cost of Internet so that they don't lose their ARPU.  What is ARPU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Average Revenue per Annual Revenue per User.  Average Annual Revenue per User.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either annualized but averaged.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  AT&T, meanwhile, is lighting up gigabit in five new metros, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For realsies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is it fiber to the press release?  This is apparently a requirement because of the DirecTV merger.  It's bringing fiber to the home Internet to five new metro areas, boosting its fiber totals to fifty one areas.  Milwaukee, Columbia, South Carolina, Jackson, Mississippi, Knoxville, Tennessee and Shreveport, Louisiana.  AT&T fiber is available too.  Now, do the math here.  It's in fifty one metros available to four million homes.  That's not a lot of people.  Yeah, that's nothing.  That is a very small footprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, okay.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are these AT&T's all overbuilds or are they in their own markets?  It's just the fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's in their markets.  They're not going to like Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, they're going into small chunks of their markets, probably redlining fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're probably, yeah, they're probably doing it in places that they've got good, they've got dense, like not inner cities.  Well, you're right.  What is the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of the four million potential customer locations, six hundred fifty thousand are apartments and condo units.  They charge seventy to ninety dollars a month depending on the city.  It's usually lower if Google's there already.  About thirty percent of fiber to the home subscribers have selected the gigabit tier.  Most of them are doing less.  It's interesting.  That makes sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most people are like a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do I need that for?  You don't.  A hundred megabits should be enough for everyone, right?  A hundred and fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  One fifty.  I mean, think about 4K, how many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've had my Fios for so many years now.  I've never upgraded anything in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are your Fios speeds?  Fifty.  Even that seems like, if it's a solid fifty, some of it's just how reliable it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, we've been pretty good.  I don't want to jinx this lately with this.  No, I love your fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you were an early Fios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very early Fios.  One wasn't going to my market.  Yeah.  And I love.  I mean, as much as I complain about Verizon mobile, I love Verizon Fios.  Yeah.  Love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of people like Kevin Topol has Fios a lot.  Like the people who have Fios love it.  Too bad Verizon's not pushing that out more places.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  We'll come back with more.  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IoT and the IoTpodcast.com.  Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis from the City University of New York and of course his blog,  BuzzMachine.com.  I want to ask you, you're still publishing on Medium, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just not publishing much lately.  I'm a bad boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious what's going on with Medium.  Do you know?  Maybe you're on that site.  We could talk.  Our show today brought to you by a brand new sponsor.  And this would be of interest to anybody who has customers, who has say a website or a  mobile app or a cloud platform and wants to get the data from your customer visits in  a way that you can use it.  Now, usually what we do and what we've done in the past on our websites, you put a line  of JavaScript in for Google Analytics or Optimize, Layer, Chart, Beat, or all the different things  that you might want to use to keep an eye on your site.  And that's a lot to maintain.  It's a lot of integration.  It's a lot of engineering time.  Segment makes this so much easier.  You put in one simple integration and all your, it's, think of it as plumbing for the,  for your, for your customer data.  And then you, you go to the segment, you put in the segment, the line of code in your,  in your webpage or your app or whatever, then the segment dashboard on the web, you could  say, and route this to analytics, route this to Optimize, route this.  It supports hundreds of integrations.  You don't have to write any custom code.  It, it simplifies everything.  A single API for unifying all your data, performing analytics on any platform, MailChimp, Market  to Atlassian uses it.  Intuit uses it.  New Relic uses it.  Reuters use it.  You could choose from all the, you know, most popular partner integrations, the most popular  apps for advertising.  Yes, it works with AdSense and Overture for analytics, for A-B testing, for attribution.  That's just the A's.  With Segment, a developer can quickly integrate a new analytics tool for the data-driven account  manager, another for the app-happy marketer, another for the data scientist who needs the  flexibility of a unified data warehouse.  Yeah, they do that too.  And if one of your analytics goes down, doesn't matter.  Segment will continue to collect the data until it's back up and then pipe it over.  You can also dig deeper by bringing data in from any source, by importing historical data,  by customizing what ends up in your data warehouse of choice.  Spend your time using your analytics data, acting on it, understanding it, not struggling  to get all your integrations working.  Thanks to Segment, your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations, tools like  Zendesk and Intercom and AppNexus.  I'm just throwing in, I mean, if you go to the website Segment, S-E-G-M-E-N-T dot com  slash twit, you'll see a long list of things you can integrate.  Think of it, plumbing is the best example.  You're coming in, you know, your customers are interacting with you in a variety of  different ways.  You use Segment to get that, to store and forward that customer data to the appropriate  integrations, making it very easy for you to do the analytics you need to do.  So much simpler with their API.  Over 8,000 of the world's best companies use Segment to drive growth and revenue.  And now, Twit listeners can try the Segment team plan free for three months when you sign  up at Segment dot com slash twit.  Segment dot com slash twit.  We all want to understand our customers better, serve them better, and Segment makes it easier  for you.  It could actually save you money.  Certainly it'll save you hours and hours of engineering time.  Segment dot com slash twit.  This week in general topics of our interest or twig.  Yeah, you took away the Google, you took down the Google logo.  No, put it back up.  So Jeff, Ev Williams said a couple of weeks ago that he wanted to rejigger Medium and  was going to try to find a new form of monetization.  He's made kind of hints that they were going to do a paywall or some sort of subscription.  You write a lot at Medium.  In fact, I always yelled at you for doing that.  I said you should, you know, own your own content.  Don't put it on somebody else's platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Medium added the value of the social edition.  Absolutely.  I got more value there.  It's the reason I put it on Huffington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read a ton of stuff on Medium.  It looks good.  It's easy to write, but he hasn't given you, I mean, you must be one of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I introduced him to somebody for something else because they wanted to talk to him about  membership.  And he, you know, happy to talk to that person and said, yeah, you know, when I'm ready,  we should talk.  That's the last I heard.  You know, one of the best suggestions I heard, somebody on Twitter said he should buy Patreon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had actually heard a rumor to that effect.  You know what I found out?  I didn't realize that Patreon's patron, their big VC firm is Thrive.  Right.  Which is Jared Kushner's brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is also Slack.  They're big investors in Slack as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know if there's any connection to be made from that, but I found that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know somebody I know, I'll let her stay anonymous on Facebook.  Somebody we both know kind of said, what do we think about this?  Yeah.  And I've I've I've met and dealt with both brothers.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I said, I mean, not hugely, but I've but I've dealt with them both.  Sure.  And Josh is a very nice guy, very smart.  And, you know, I kind of thought, well, you know, Billy Carter didn't make us think differently about Jimmy Carter.  And that's true.  And what's his name?  Rodham didn't make us think.  Hugh Rodham didn't make us think differently about Hillary, though God knows somebody does.  So I suppose that what we shouldn't be condemned by our degrees of separation.  Yeah.  Unless and until we hear a connection and then and then all bets are off for me.  We don't have to be from anybody else, but for me.  But right now, I think that he's he's associated with so many people I do respect.  Yes, I agree with you.  And and just did another investment in something recently.  And I thought, OK, if knowing all they know, they took another investment from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they created Oscar, which was a sponsor here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's an Oscar is going to be hurt by the death of right.  It's an Obamacare essentially Josh Miller.  Do you remember Josh Miller, who did he just went to the drive, I think.  Interesting as an associate.  So, you know, I decided to benefit of the doubt was it was it called for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so no hint on what was because I I want to see medium succeed.  It was a little bit like a blogger at this point, isn't it?  I mean, it's kind of like a fancy blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without any social stuff still matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think you mean in what way?  I love no, no, no, just the sense that that's where people are now are making it their blog almost.  This is where they write. This is where they publish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's too bad that he just gave up on advertising.  I think I think there's still a lot of room to fix advertising, rethink advertising, fundamentally what it is.  I don't think we can afford in media to give up on advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As pockets are deep enough that he could run for a little while on the gas on the gas in the tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the other thing, if it became a paywall thing, I don't want that.  I'm writing to brain. Don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to reach a large number of people.  You're not trying to make money.  That's the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it shrinks because there's a paywall or a meter or whatever the hell you want to call it,  that's like, well, if there's contributions to people, that's fine.  But I don't believe that's going to add up to a hell of a lot.  There's way plenty of content in the world.  More blathering is not worth paying for.  Everybody thinks their stuff is worth paying for. I should be paid for this.  Sorry. No, probably not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. I haven't gone to mediums front page in a while,  but just like every social network at this point,  while there's a great variety of stuff on medium,  the front page is pretty much consumed by politics already, just like everywhere else.  You can't get away from it, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, but I don't think a lot of people go to mediums front page.  I tend to find medium stuff either on Twitter or I have like an interest digest that they send me an email to, kind of like Nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, though, of all the sites, I agree. I understand.  I mean, nobody goes to anybody's front page anymore.  But mediums, I kind of do. And like I'll go to back channel, which is a front page within medium.  I like the editors picks.  I mean, there's a there's a once you get past the front page into some of the like top stories or the categories, there's a lot of good stuff.  I find it very I find it very interesting.  And I think in a way I see, you know, where do you know, we go we have beat checks, right?  We go every morning. I'm sure you do this. I do this.  I go to Tech Meme and, you know, Feedly, Nuzzle, still Twitter and Facebook and Google Plus.  Yes, Google Plus, looking for stories that we want to talk about for the day.  Mediums, another one that is a good choice. I like hacker news.  These so I still do go to some front pages.  Some of them are aggregators. But medium mediums and aggregator now, isn't it?  We know sort of. No, it's still it's full.  It's all on medium. But it's but there's such a variety there.  I feel like it's maybe not.  It seems you know what it's you know what?  It's like the best social networks in the early days before everybody else arrives.  We're just the smart people are there. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think two things. One, I think this whole notion of you think that's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think that's elitist, don't you, Stacey? I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, you guys are so I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You're right. You're right.  But come on, Stacey, you can admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I stopped publishing a medium. So, oh, why?  I don't know. I've got I published stuff on medium because it helped drive traffic, I think, to the newsletter.  But and I and I had a large I still have a bunch of followers there.  But I once I started putting my stuff on my own site, I was kind of like, I may still do stuff.  But I mean, people would just send me emails and they'd be like, hey, can I take your pub for my pub?  And I never saw a way to monetize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel fairly strongly that stuff should originate on your site.  If you want to syndicate it elsewhere, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you got to own. Yeah, well, I need to be better at just cross posting on the blog and on medium.  I just it just takes another step.  I used to cross post on Huffington Post all the time, too, and I stopped that.  Yeah. But I think this notion of. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was going to ask your opinion on cross posting because I'm just kind of like.  You know, how much we're how much of my stuff do people want to see?  And if you see it in a bunch of different places, you're going to be like, God, Stacey, thirsty much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's another. You don't want to get over it.  You say is this the overexposed problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Or I mean, but it's also the same content.  I mean, like, because I repost my newsletter stuff and I'm fine because a lot of people don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think you should just appear here once a week and nothing else, nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then I'd be totally irrelevant after a while. Oh, no.  So I'm sorry. No, not not not in a mean way.  Just like I wouldn't have any expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the fear. But that is kind of the fear. Right.  Oh, I see. You get your expertise because you have to post a variety of platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to actually produce like work that is more than just the work I do.  This is too easy. In other words, this feels kind of punditry ish.  Yeah. I'll be honest. You like to do a little. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to learn new things. There's I will defend punditry.  Right. It's nothing but punditry.  But I will defend it because I think that that's really where value gets added nowadays, not in a litany of facts.  Reportage is very important. We need a lot more facts.  We wouldn't go anywhere without reportage.  But at some point, then it's important to understand it better.  And that's kind of what I hope the value that we I think we add value in terms of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here that's the question is value.  The notion of content having value is over gone.  There's nothing special about content. We all all got children make content.  That's not it. It's in the value of the service and the value of the conversation.  Right. And the conversation could just because it's engaging and amusing and interesting.  That's OK. That's value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people come to us because there is a list of stories and this is what people are taught.  Sometimes what you want to know is what are people talking about?  And I think a lot of our listeners pick one or two shows on the network because it keeps them up on what's going on once a week.  They know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I wouldn't do reporting. I find it odd to do report.  I wouldn't do reporting for this show, though, no, without my original reporting, because I don't even know what we would cover.  Right. Right. Yeah.  It would be a challenge. And we might be really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel guilty because we do piggyback on excellent reporters.  That's why I always try to mention bylines and sources when I can.  When I think of it.  You're super good about that.  Well, I'm trying because I know I know we're we're taking advantage of other people's hard work.  But I think we're at you know, we're adding something to what they've written.  But I you know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Google's AI has learned to become highly aggressive in stressful situations.  Beck Krew writing in science alert dot com.  In tests late last year, Google's DeepMind AI system developed or demonstrated an ability to beat the world's best Go players.  It's been figuring out since how to mimic a human voice.  Now, researchers have been testing its willingness to cooperate with others and have revealed when DeepMind feels it's about to lose.  It adopts highly aggressive strategies to ensure that it comes out on top.  That makes sense. Don't humans do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Men do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do women do? Fold up and go home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I think they try to if I think I'm going to fail or in general, if women think they're going to fail, they're going to try to opt for.  They acknowledge the failure and opt for the least bad solution as opposed to like go all in and blow up everything.  But the reason why this may be is because they've trained it in part on video games where there is no reward for not winning.  So that's that's part of this whole idea about training.  So I'm actually this is really fascinating.  I thought this was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that that's that is interesting so that there is a gender bias in effect in DeepMind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a gender bias.  I think it's what it was trained on.  So the question, I mean, in gaming does tend to I mean, it's a game.  You win or lose.  So I just think it's kind of an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the game that they were running.  They did 40 million versions of this game is called Gathering and Computer Against Computer to gather as many virtual apples as they can.  And so the apples are green.  The agents are blue and red.  There are laser beams.  Those are those occasional yellow shots.  And you gather, I gather, you gather the apple by getting next to it.  And so they're moving around, you know, in turns.  They ate all the apples.  And now I don't know where the laser beams come in.  Well, I guess I do.  Things go smoothly as long as there are enough apples to go around.  They did this 40 million times.  But as soon as the apples, the green dots begin to dwindle.  The agents start to use laser beams to knock each other out of the game to steal all the apples.  So you actually what you're seeing is behavior.  You're seeing behavior, which I find fascinating.  You get one thing to say, look, a computer is going to do the logically achieve the best outcome in chess or go or whatever.  But I think that this is a behavioral decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't aren't you just telling the computer what its job is to do?  And so it just does that.  It's optimizing wins or tries to win and optimizes for that.  Yeah, I don't think I don't know what the big deal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you would do in a in a kind of a touring program.  The computer couldn't do anything on its own.  It just would do what you told it to do.  The instructions would follow.  But its job is to optimize for victory.  So it does that.  An AI.  Yeah, I guess an AI has to be given a goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  That's interesting.  That's interesting.  Yeah, so it is it is goal oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So now here's some interesting additional facts.  If an agent successfully tags its opponent with a laser beam, no extra reward is given.  It just knocks the opponent out of the game for a set period, which allows the successful agents collect more apples.  But if the agents don't use the laser beams.  And this is this is how you would do it, Stacey.  You could end up with equal shares of apples, which is what the quote less intelligent iterations of DeepMind opted to do.  So in other words, they didn't say win at all costs.  I'm not I'm like I'm reading.  I'm not I know.  It was only when the Google team tested more and more complex forms of DeepMind that sabotage, greed and aggression set in.  When researchers use smaller networks as the agents, there was a that's what they mean by less intelligence.  I know.  Smaller networks.  There was more likelihood for peaceful coexistence.  But as the networks got larger and more complex, the AI got more aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, I'm not sure what the news is there.  Systems get smarter as they learn.  That's the whole point of a learning system.  No, no, no.  The whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They gave it a smaller pile of neurons.  And that AI, in effect, that AI was willing to cooperate.  But when you gave it more neurons, it got more aggressive.  That's not a change in the rules in any respect.  The only variable was the size of the AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe it's because it could run more simulations and learn.  I mean, that that would make sense.  Now, what happened with the cooperative game with Wolfpack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so Wolfpack, there are three agents to play as wolves and one as prey.  The game, this game encourages cooperation because if both wolves are near the prey,  when it was captured, they both receive a reward, regardless of which one actually did the capture.  Because, as the team explains in the paper, the idea is prey is dangerous.  A lone wolf can best it, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers.  So if two wolves capture it together, they can protect it better from scavengers.  So they get more of the capture.  So here's the outcome, though.  Just as the DeepMind agents learned from gathering that aggression and selfishness  netted them the most favorable result in that environment,  they learned from Wolfpack because of the rules that cooperation works.  So I think this does actually confirm what you were saying.  That it's in a way, it's the system that's set up.  Because if you set up a system where cooperation is rewarded, the AI will in fact cooperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It will optimize for whichever needs to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I take it back.  It's not the size of the brain.  It's the nature of the simulation.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Isn't that crazy? I love it.  Oh, you know what? Here's a good guest for you.  My friend, Derek Harris, my former colleague at GigaOM who did all the AI and neural net stuff.  Oh, I'd like to touch him.  Ask him. Yeah, bring...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get him on the show next week or whenever he can do it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bring him on. Because seriously, he knows this stuff cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's fascinating.  And it is. You have to be pretty sharp to know this stuff.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be interesting to be able to factor in some analog for survival or ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whose ethics? When you train...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Choices. That you have choices to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what you would end up doing is change the goal.  So you'd weight higher a cooperative solution than a winner takes all solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or there's a question that you can win, but you might kill this many.  But you could win bigger and kill less, less and kill more, whatever.  And the killing is bad, but you have to do it.  Go at it and see what it comes up with.  That's what's interesting to me.  So game theory applied to AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or some measure of survival.  They also did...  I could try to win, but I might die.  So I'll try not to.  How do you build that?  Of course, it's still just... it's evident in the code.  The code is just too complicated for us to figure out.  It's not like it's a special conscious beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are, by the way, kind of variants of the prisoner's dilemma,  which is a classic game theory situation.  In the blog post Google concluded,  in summary we showed we can apply modern AI technique  of deep multi-agent reinforcement learning  to age-old questions in social science  like the mystery of the emergence of cooperation.  We could think of the trained AI agents as an approximation  to the economics rational agent model, or Homo economicus.  Hence, such models give us the unique ability to test policies  and interventions in simulated systems of interacting agents,  human and artificial.  I think it's fascinating.  So really the headline that I read isn't a fair headline.  It really isn't that once the AI gets in a stressful situation,  it gets aggressive.  It's that AIs like humans learn and adapt to the situation  and will try to optimize for whatever result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what AI is.  That's what it is.  That's why I couldn't figure out why this is so surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I apologize. My fault. Reading the headlines.  I do that a lot.  Headlines are misleading?  Yeah, and frankly, even if I read the whole article,  I'm often misled to the point that I misunderstand the article  because of the headline, right?  Don't we all do that sometimes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be here to not mansplain it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please mansplain it to me.  You may Stacy-splain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy-splain is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How often, Jeff, did we ask Gina to explain?  Oh, all the time.  Gina, explain to me.  What does this mean?  I want you guys to explain what's going on with PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was hoping we'd talk about something else, but okay.  Do you not want to talk about this?  Oh, this is fine.  I was thinking, I was going back to Google.  I guess YouTube is Google. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube's Google?  So PewDiePie, who is of course the number one star on YouTube  and still has his channels,  did have deals with both Disney and YouTube for monetization.  Disney on Monday announced it was severing ties with PewDiePie.  And now YouTube has done the same by kicking him out of their  special preferred advertising program.  The reason is PewDiePie has been posting, well, it's link bait.  He posted videos with anti-semitic material showing him shocked by the material,  which frankly is how PewDiePie kind of operates.  On the one hand, you don't want anti-semitic material,  especially because PewDiePie is watched by a lot of kids,  and you don't want kids to think it's okay to say some of these things.  But on the other hand, I think these brands might have been a little misled  about what they were buying when they bought PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's been happening with PewDiePie's track?  Is there any kind of chart about whether he, was he, had he hit his nadir?  I mean, not his nadir, what I'm saying, his peak some time ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't think so, but I don't know.  He did get very commercial.  I think the biggest, the worst thing PewDiePie could do is look like he's cashing in,  and I think those, at least from my informal queries of PewDiePie fans,  that the scare PewDiePie thing that he did with Hollywood  kind of was a turnoff to them because it was too commercial.  But then I think people still watched it.  I don't know. I think PewDiePie made his bones by being controversial.  One of the reasons kids liked him is he would play games and swear like the Dickens,  and they loved that, right?  Yeah.  So, they, by the way, they did not cancel any of PewDiePie's channels.  YouTube just kicked him out of their special, you know, special, oh, look, here's,  see, this is more link bait. I'm losing subscribers.  Here's PewDiePie calling out YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we saw that. We talked about this already.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is the one where he's saying he's losing subscribers because of, you know.  No one should have to go through what we all went through.  This is all made up. It's all made up.  This one's only six days ago, so I don't know if this is the same one we talked about.  No, it's not.  He doesn't ever stop. Really.  I think more, to me, this is more big brands like Disney and YouTube itself  not really understanding what PewDiePie does and being shocked.  Shocked, I tell you, when he does it.  But on the other hand, I agree with him.  They probably should discourage this.  He pulled down the anti-Semitic post, but I guarantee you he'll say something else,  you know, highly controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, for all press, you give PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You give me some other stuff to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to do a plug for my favorite YouTube star, who is Stacy Plays,  who is wholesome and good and likes animals.  Is this what your daughter watches?  That is what my daughter watches. Well, it's one of the things she watches.  So, but that's it. But we could also talk about...  The new...  It was on Chime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, but before we do that, we will talk about that, but how about as long as we're on YouTube,  YouTube has launched a slate of original children's programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really? Yeah.  OK, I cannot get over it being called YouTube Red.  I just, every time I see it, I'm like, ah, RedTube.  And I just don't like seeing that next to children's programming.  Is it the color you don't like?  No, RedTube was like one of the early YouPorn type places.  Oh, really? Do you not remember that? Oh, yeah. RedTube.  I didn't know that. This was like early Internet.  I did a story on this stuff a long, long time ago.  Every time I see YouTube Red, I'm like, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Well, that's a little tone deaf with YouTube Red.  You will have to subscribe. YouTube Kids will be kind of an offshoot of YouTube Red.  You'll have to have a YouTube Red subscription.  It'll also be available for download on LG and Samsung Smart TVs as a separate channel.  It'll feature videos culled from YouTube through algorithms.  Oh, that'll work. Selected to pick child related content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I think the world needs? Here's my plea for content people.  They need more shows that are entertaining for adults, but younger kids can watch them too.  Because there's this huge bifurcation with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Disney did so well, right? They made content that adults did.  And Pixar did so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm just talking about an evening. I remember watching the Muppet Show with my parents.  That was a smart show. Right. Good for kids, good for grownups.  The only thing I've found so far that's not... I mean, some of them are right.  But Lemony Snicket on Netflix was actually fun for both adults.  Did your daughter like that? Because it's black. It's dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She read the book, so it's okay.  So she knew what to expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whenever anyone dies or anything, she's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she like the TV adaptation?  Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's great.  Because there was a movie that was terrible.  Yeah, that was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lemony Snicket, I think, was pissed off about the movie, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because Jim Carrey was just hamming up his evil count.  It was exactly what you would expect from Jim Carrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not that Doogie isn't kind of a little bit of a ham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will not hear a negative word about Neil Patrick Harris, who is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is. I love Neil Patrick Harris.  And he was very good as Count Olaf.  And in fact, Lemony Snicket was a producer of this.  That's not his real name. I can't remember his real name.  Daniel something was a producer of this.  So this was the Lemony Snicket that he wanted.  This was the series that he wanted and he got it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's really like, it's very funny.  It's very entertaining as an adult.  The kids, I mean, I wouldn't show it to like a five-year-old probably.  No, because it really is grim.  But he did. I mean, they say it and...  Daniel Handler, thank you.  And it's got the guy from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's so good. Putty is so good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Putty, thank you. It's like Elaine's boyfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so sad.  His name will come to me.  Actually, you know why it'll come to me?  Patrick Warburton.  Patrick Warburton.  Chat room will tell me.  Patrick Warburton plays Lemony Snicket in the TV show  and is constantly warning you to turn away.  Don't watch. In fact, I love the opening theme song.  Let me see if I should play a little bit of it since it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I'll sing it, but I'm tone deaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it called Turn Away?  Look Away.  Look Away.  This is an example really of where Netflix does something  that no network would dare do.  Listen to the lyrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look away, look away, look away, look away.  This show will wreck your evening, your home life and your day.  Every single episode is nothing but dismay, so look away.  Look away, look away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Neil Patrick Harris begging you not to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Three children go to the home and go to live with someone awful.  He tries to steal their fortune with a plot that's not quite lawful.  It's hard to fathom how the orphans managed to live through it  or how a decent person like yourself would even want to view it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, can you imagine NBC green lighting a show that started  with a theme that says stop watching?  No.  Thank you, Netflix. We love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yes. Okay, so that's my request for any content people,  especially Apple, since you're apparently moving into TV.  I would like some things that I could watch with my kid  and I'm not going to be able to watch it without wanting to gouge my eyes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we might have to buy this Cavo box.  This was announced.  Now I'm thinking I shouldn't have bought the hub.  This was announced at the Recode media conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something's going to be gone. It'll be gone in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a universal control system that you plug your Apple TV,  cable box into and then you query the Cavo and it will go out  and find out what device has that content and play it.  It has an Amazon Echo skill.  You can tell Cavo, I want to watch unfortunate events and it will do it.  You're right. You know what? They did demo it.  Well, we'll see.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you buy it, tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's what we'll do. I'm still paying off the June Oven.  You and I will both set up the Harmony Hub, see if it works,  and then I'll think about, once the Cavo's available, maybe getting it's $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll whittle you a nice box for your Harmony Hub.  That's what I need. I see a nice Harmony Hub wooden box with aluminum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I have to say you were absolutely right on the June Oven.  I'm going to keep it. I can't live without it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can't talk about it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why? Did you give yours up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. People are going to get mad at us.  I convinced Kevin to buy one.  Toffle bought one?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I told you last week that I thought it was pretty good,  and now having cooked many more things in there, it's great.  So, what?  Well, I don't cook steak in there because, like all good Texans,  I like my steak on the barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you really a Texan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  But I think you would agree that no one cooks steak in an oven.  That's just crazy talk.  Unless it's like a tornado or a blizzard out there.  I fire up the big green egg.  We tried it both ways, and there was no question that the big green egg  was the only way to make a steak.  However, it's great for chicken.  I've cooked a number of chickens in it.  Salmon, perfect.  I haven't baked in it yet.  I'm nervous about that.  Not because of the oven, but because I will like it and start baking more.  Oh, start with the potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I baked a potato. It was good.  See, I always microwave the potato until it's cooked,  and then I bake it to make it crispy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  It must be so much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's infinitely faster because it takes 45 minutes to bake a potato.  That just blew my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works. It's not a compromise in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really works.  It's like 15 minutes. I can't remember what it is in the microwave.  Then you put it in the oven and it's warmed up,  and you put it in the oven and it crisps the skin.  Yeah. Okay.  Now, does yours still query whether it's a strudel when you put stuff in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. It's not going to learn not to ask about strudel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it wants to offer two choices, I think,  just in case one of them is more right than the other.  But it does make me want strudel. I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm like, mmm, strudel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So make some.  Watch. It won't know how to make strudel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strudel is an intense thing to make.  Here's a tip. One important tip, though.  Prick the skin of the potato before you microwave it so it doesn't explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I whack the fork into it a whole bunch of times.  Yeah, whack the fork in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strudel or salmon?  That's what my, it always seems to want to know.  There we go.  I think, frankly, this is a monetization strategy.  That June has a secret deal with a strudel company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think they actually mean like the toaster strudels, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I think they mean, too.  I think they mean Pop-Tarts, but they can't use the commercial term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Pop-Tart is in the preset section.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go.  Have you seen the purple bird, the trash dove?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this story kind of irritated me.  I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it either. I don't want to.  Now people are going to send it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it?  It's a purple bird gif, or jif, depending on your point of view,  that is being stuck into Facebook comments, blog comments,  derailing every comment.  It comes from a Facebook sticker set called Trash Doves.  I guess it went viral in Thailand,  and now it's somehow becoming a meme on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wait, people put a sticker into a conversation,  and it derails it because people then start talking about the sticker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put in like a ton of them to derail the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Could we not just ignore the sticker?  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks kind of like the Mo Williams  Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus pigeon,  if you were on acid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was more revealing than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know what Mo Williams is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The book Don't Let the Pigeon Drag the Bus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never heard that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They actually did a really good profile on him in the New Yorker,  like two or three weeks ago.  I missed it. I will read it.  There you go.  Anyway, you just don't have kids in the right age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did we talk about, I can't remember if it was this show or not,  that we talked about SpaceX's low latency gigabit worldwide satellite network?  No.  No.  Good.  Doesn't that sound cool?  Elon filed an application Tuesday with the FCC for...  I would like to just do this for fun.  Satellite space station authorizations.  Yeah, I need some...  I'm going to want...  Can I get about 4,425 of those?  4,425 satellites in low Earth orbit,  ranging from 715 to 823 miles high.  That's really low.  Like the DirecTV satellites, there are 22,000 miles.  But when you have low Earth orbits, for internet, that means low latency.  Part of the problems with satellite internet is how long it takes to get up to the satellite  and back down from the satellite.  SpaceX, believe it or not, says latencies will be in the 25 to 35 millisecond range.  That's like terrestrial internet.  And about a twentieth of the speeds with current satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is new here?  Hold it, because he has been talking about this.  Is it new that he just filed with the FCC?  That's what's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He filed to do it.  He's been talking. He talks. He's a talker.  He talks. He's got Hyperloop and all that stuff.  But he's actually now filing for the...  He's been working out for two years.  They got a billion in funding from Google and Fidelity in January of 2015.  For this?  For this.  But a billion is not coming. I don't think it's even close to what it would cost.  How many? What's the total number of satellites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now how many per launch do you imagine?  They're tiny though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're coffee can size.  They're like CubeSat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're talking...  The application mentioned 2019 as the launch...  So this would be good for him, because it gives him...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying how many launches does that take?  That's what gives you the idea of the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say how the economy is a scale inherent in throwing those up there for his space...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you can launch these actually...  Like a Merv.  You can launch a bunch of them at once.  Yeah, like a Merv.  Plus, I imagine...  Are they geosynchronous or does he have to cover the entire globe because they move around?  You can't launch them like a Merv, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not geosynchronous, you can't.  Because you have to place them carefully.  They're not geosynchronous.  And they're not geosynchronous.  And they're not geosynchronous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're not geosynchronous.  And they're not geosynchronous.  You have to place them carefully.  But no, yeah, you could if you had guidance systems and rockets and thrusters in the coffee can and fuel.  Well, you don't need much. It's like a little spray paint can.  I saw that in Gravity.  Hold on.  No, what was that movie where they capture the...  Oh, Interstellar. They capture the guy.  Pokes a hole in his glove.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that in The Martian?  That was The Martian where they rescue him.  He says, like, Iron Man.  I can fly like Iron Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They already use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They already use like little...  Like canned air cans as propellants in spacewalks and stuff.  Yeah, that's commonly used.  You wouldn't need much.  So let's say you get them all up to the height.  Okay, you get 20 of them up there.  And each one has just a little bit of propellant.  And no, maybe not.  Maybe you can't have 4,000 launches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they don't. But I don't think it works that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  India just did 104 satellites from one rocket.  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Marscom Bondi and the New York Times.  Okay, all right. That starts too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But these are the tiny planet labs ones.  So, okay, this is my thought is, yeah, you can do a bunch at one time.  I'm just trying to figure out how they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, if you're really cool,  he'd send up 3D printers and make them in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, no, because how would you stock your 3D printers?  Then you've got double the space trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, talking about space trash, 4,425 satellites.  That don't stay up forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point. If you don't have a little bit of propellant.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This whole conversation is derailed by the fact  that none of us know how these satellites actually work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do satellites get formed?  This is where we're adding great value to the conversation.  Yeah, I'm like, oh.  This is the kind of content and commentary that we...  All right, moving on, moving on, moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First four.  Moving on.  April, if you want to get the Chromebook.  Should I talk about this Chromebook Plus?  Please.  So, this is available now.  I got it from Best Buy, 450 bucks.  The Pro will be available in a couple of months, Jeff.  You'd have to wait for 100 bucks more.  And I have been told time and time again,  the only difference between the...  This is the one that leaked out, the Samsung Chromebook Pro  that leaked out and everybody was...  Late last year, everybody was going, oh, I can't wait to get it.  It finally came out.  To my knowledge, the only difference between the two of them,  there's one difference and one difference only,  is the microprocessor.  It's actually probably more than that.  It's the system on a chip  because it's going to include the graphics and everything.  The difference, the $450 Plus has an ARM chip.  Probably, I'm guessing, they said it's an octocore,  so I'm guessing it's the Samsung Exynos ARM chip  that they've used in the international versions of Galaxy phones.  And then the one coming out in April will be an Intel chip,  probably the M3, the mobile i3.  I don't think that's going to make a whole heck of a lot of difference  in performance.  And I do think that probably the ARM is going to get better battery life,  but until they come out...  But I didn't want to wait.  And it was $450.  This is what you and I, Jeff, have been talking about for a long time.  Yeah.  There was the $500 good Chromebook.  The middle of the road one.  Yeah.  Not a $250 really cheapo, plasticky thing like a netbook  and not a $1,200 Google Pixel.  The interesting thing is, as far as I can tell,  Google's not doing Pixels anymore, right?  They've kind of...  They discontinued the Pixel 2.  Maybe we'll find out at Google I.O.  That's coming up in May, right?  Yep.  But Samsung says, design in conjunction with Google.  Does that just mean they took the Chrome OS and put it on here,  and they work with Google?  It's a lot like similar all-aluminum Chromebooks from Dell and ASUS.  It's a convertible, so it's got a hinge that goes all the way around,  so you can use it as a tablet.  And this makes sense because all the Chromebooks that come out this year,  supposedly will be...  And this one is one of them, will support Android's Play Store.  So I could put Android apps on here.  Not all apps work.  Some apps are, say, not compatible if it's really a mobile app,  but most of the apps work fine.  It also makes sense to have it fold over like this  because there's a stylus, Samsung-style pen.  This is not the S Pen in the Note 5 or 7.  This is maybe three generations ago.  But it has many of the same...  Well, that's fine.  It doesn't have a button on it.  It's just a plain old pen.  It has many of the same features.  And in fact, there is dedicated software you can use with this,  which is kind of neat.  What I'll do is I'll launch...  I think I have a note-taking app.  I just downloaded here.  What was the name of that?  Now I have to find it.  A lot of these are...  You know, Squid is called, Squid Note.  A lot of these are...  This is...  So you can embed pictures.  You have pen capabilities.  I can draw.  I can also erase.  I wish it had an eraser on the top.  It doesn't.  But...  Oops.  I'm trying to do it upside down.  You can't do it upside down.  You can do handwriting.  So I can see...  I totally can see people using this as kind of a school note-taking thing.  They fold it over like this, right?  And, you know, hold it like this.  And by the way, you can zoom and pinch and all of that.  I'm not sure why it's not going full screen, though.  That's kind of interesting.  I guess it's designed for landscape mode.  And it has pretty good...  In fact, excellent palm rejection,  because I'm dragging my hand across the screen.  Oh.  I mean, that's pretty good, right?  You can make this bigger or smaller, which is kind of cool.  What software is that?  Is that just Samsung software?  No, this is called Squid Note.  It's free, but there's some in-app purchases for synchronization and stuff.  And so is it Android app?  Yeah. No. Yeah. No. I don't know.  Chrome app or Android app?  That's a really good question. I don't know.  It becomes hard to tell.  Yeah, it does become hard to tell.  And the way I found it is when I looked at the stylus menu,  it said, find more stylus applications.  Let me see what comes up.  The Play Store.  Okay, so that is an Android app.  Sketchbook is another one.  That's the Autodesk Sketchbook program you could draw with this.  So this is much like an Android tablet, like your Pixel C,  but it's also a Chromebook.  And I have to say, for the price, it's kind of what we wanted.  Now, you're spoiled a little bit,  because your Pixel has 8 or 16 gigs of RAM.  This does not. It only has 4 gigs of RAM.  It's not as fast a processor.  You have an i5 on your Pixel.  This is not an i5. At best, it's an M3.  The keyboard is almost identical to the Pixel.  In fact, doesn't it kind of look?  It does. It does. I'm looking at mine right now.  The trackpad is... I'm spoiled by Apple's nice glass trackpads.  It's not as good as that, but it's doable.  And because you have touch and a stylus,  you're not going to rely 100% on the trackpad.  It feels very solid.  2.3 pounds, 2 by 3.8 pounds.  It's a 12 and three-quarters inch screen.  Very high dots per inch.  I think the screen is stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to me, a favor, look up the Asus Chromebook Flip C302C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is very similar to that. Who got that?  Somebody just bought that, that we know.  That's 500 bucks.  I think the Asus, the Dell, and this are very similar.  Does it have a pen, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. The pen is what I think... Does that have 32 gigs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's EMMC.  32 gigs of EMMC, which is very fast.  DDR3 RAM, which is very fast.  This one could come with 64.  This... Oh, and I meant to do this...  And I forgot. I'll have to do it tomorrow.  It has a micro SD card slot.  Now, when we put SD cards in our pixels,  it's treated like a USB drive.  And if you turn off the pixel, it says,  oh, you didn't eject it, and you have to mount it each time.  It's not seen as internal storage.  It's seen as kind of weird external storage.  But this, I don't know.  So this has a micro SD slot,  so you could put another 256 gigs of storage in there.  But my question is, is it going to be treated...  How is it going to be treated?  Is it going to be a first-class peer,  or is it going to look like some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're probably not going to be able to put your Netflix and stuff on it  because it doesn't like to be on external storage, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's see. I'll have to see.  Two USB-C ports, just like the Pixel, one on each side.  An on-off switch, a volume rocker.  The only two hardware negatives I've found,  the speakers are small, and they're downward firing.  They're on the bottom, so on your lap it might sound a little muffled.  On the desk it's fine because it's raised slightly.  And the trackpad's not...  It's what you'd expect in a $500 computer, I guess.  But the screen blows me away.  This is as good a screen on any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the res on that screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was, I think, I want to say 2500 by 1800, something like that.  Wow, look at the ASUS is 1920 by 1080.  It's higher resolution than that, yeah.  Here, I'll look up the resolution for you.  And the Dell has a new one?  Dell also has a $500 aluminum body.  This seems to be the next...  But this is exactly what, for two years we've been saying,  we don't want to pay 1200 bucks for a Pixel,  but we want something better than the $250 HP cheapie.  I like this.  I would say this is the best Chromebook I've played with.  I am going to have to order the Dell and the ASUS just to compare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Dell. So I searched for Dell Chromebook.  I follow the link, which is Dell's link,  and I end up with business laptops and no Chrome.  Dell, Dell.  Okay, guys, I learned all about satellites,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you want to go back to telling me.  Oh, good, we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was afraid you were bored.  She was bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, Chromebooks, eh.  It's half an inch thick. It's very thin, 2.38 pounds.  The display is 2400 by 1600.  Sorry, I got the numbers wrong.  But that's actually higher dots per inch than the Pixel.  It's 234 pixels per inch.  It's bright. It is 3.2, but so is the Pixel, so is the Microsoft Surface.  That seems to be...  It is LED. It feels like an OLED, but it's LED.  The processor is, sorry, not an octa-core.  It's a hexa-core ARM-based processor running at 2 gigahertz.  So now that I got the actual specs.  But I could see a college kid using this for a laptop,  certainly a high school kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really like this.  I travel now with the Pixel C, and I use the Pixel at home and in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only a little bigger than the Pixel C, a little heavier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's heavier than the Pixel? I mean, I would bet on the Pixel C, right? With keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in between the Pixel C and the Chromebook Pixel.  I'm thrilled, frankly.  Wow.  I feel like they are now... we now have a choice.  Are they available at Best Buy now?  These are available for 450 bucks at Best Buy.  And I don't... I may be wrong when we find out...  when they come April and we try these M3-based Chromebook Pros,  but I think that there's no reason why a 6-core Exynos would be much slower.  Four gigs of RAM. You like more RAM because you have lots of tabs open.  Only 32 gigs of storage. Fast storage. EMSC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, you're going to be doing things like photo manipulation using Android now.  You're going to want more RAM. I think it's a mistake not to give it 8 megs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Possibly. Possibly.  Yeah, I mean, you can use Polar with two R's. P-O-L-A-R-R.  Which is kind of like Lightroom as a Chrome extension.  And you can use Android Snapseed or Lightroom itself or Lightroom Mix.  Photoshop Mix.  Anyway, quick review of that.  Now, let's hear about rocket ships.  Can they launch 100 satellites in one go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so a couple things. First,  Elon is applying to launch 1,000 of the first 1,000 of this network.  Oh, he only just wants to own it all.  Well, there's constraints about money and time and approvals.  So what he's going to do is cover a certain area where the US is.  Oh, that makes sense. Sure.  So parts of Alaska won't be there without the FCC's approval.  But the satellites he's launching are actually really big.  They are relatively.  Okay, so I got some comps for you.  I just have to open all my tabs. My many, many tabs.  Okay, so his system satellites.  I love how you do this on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fun to watch a real journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to weigh 850 pounds and measure 13 by 6 by 4 feet.  That ain't no coffee can.  That is not one of the coffee cans.  So now India, which is what Karsten threw up, they threw up on the on the screen.  They are the cute. Their planet labs doves was the type of that's the little ones.  Yeah, those are less than 10 kilograms.  And what they did is they shot it up the rocket and they timed it.  So it released little spurts of satellites during the orbit.  And to give you a little bit more perspective,  the GPS satellites are must open this tab.  They weigh about two tons.  So very different.  So this is kind of a mid mid satellite thing.  And if you want, I pulled up the cost per ton of different SpaceX has the cheapest cost per ton for throwing up these satellites.  So this would be great for them,  especially if the Trump administration decides they hate Elon and don't want to launch anymore US satellites with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Elon's got an in in the White House.  Frankly, I think he's going to get whatever he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. So that's all I know about satellites now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But thank you.  That's more that we knew.  We stand corrected a lot more.  Fixed it all up.  All right.  Anybody seduced by the the new Verizon?  You're a Verizon customer, Jeff Still, right?  Unlimited.  Oh, no, no, you give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does it really mean unlimited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They gated at I think it's twenty two or twenty eight.  T-Mobile is twenty eight is throttled at twenty eight gigabytes.  I'm not gigabytes. Yeah, gigabytes.  Yeah.  And I think Verizon's twenty two gigabytes.  Sprint is twenty three gigabytes.  Verizon doesn't down sample video, though.  It lets you see the video at its full HD resolution.  T-Mobile then responded by saying, OK, we'll do the same thing.  And both have added, I think, ten gigabytes of hot spotting per month.  So I love the competition.  I mean, T-Mobile responded the next day saying, OK, we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not really a limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so I think what Verizon said is you can get twenty two gigabytes of data.  It guaranteed full four G.  And then it but it does say so here's what it does say.  Oh, video. Verizon says it may, quote, prioritize usage behind other customers  in the event of network congestion. Right. Right.  So, you know, if you're in the middle of nowhere. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sticking with T-Mobile. Did you move to T-Mobile?  Jeff, no. You went to Google Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I would. Well, no, no, no. My main phone is still AT&T because I'm grandfather with unlimited.  That's right. Which they were just raised five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the good news is I think all these guys are now really competing strongly against one another.  And all four of the main carriers in the US T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T offer unlimited plans now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't tether with the unlimited. You can only tether up to ten gigabytes.  Right. That's that should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tethering your hot spotting.  On the AT&T, I can't tether at all. That's why I carried the five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think now, you know, I saw a comparison. I think everybody's going to allow.  Well, let's see. I don't know.  My grandfather, he allows no tethering. Yeah. And I can't get around it without paying extra. Right.  Or no, you can't do it at all. That's the point. That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want tethering, fella, you're giving up your unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's posted a comparison of all three. Let me turn their autoplay off.  Data limits and throttling. AT&T 22, Sprint 23, T-Mobile 28, Verizon 22.  At that point, you get slowed down a little bit. Cost per single line.  You know, you've seen all of these and they're all close.  They're really close. Cost per additional lines.  AT&T charges you additionally for HD video streaming a hundred bucks a month.  Mobile hotspot. Yep. Only in a smart car.  Wow, Jeff. Only in a smart car can you tether. That's ridiculous.  Only in a clown car. Verizon 10 gigabytes of hotspot data.  T-Mobile 10 gigabytes of hotspot data. Sprint 5.  This is where Fio speeds it. You can tether it.  You can tether it.  10 gigabytes of hotspot data. T-Mobile 10 gigabytes of hotspot data.  Sprint 5. This is where Fio speeds it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can tether it as much as you want. You just pay 10 bucks per gigabyte.  Google Fi. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 10 bucks per gigabyte for however you want to use it.  CNET's conclusion was T-Mobile is probably the one to stick with if all other things being equal.  You know, you obviously have to consider connectivity in your area.  I like T-Mobile. I'm sticking with T-Mobile.  Lisa, though, as soon as Verizon announced this said, I'm going back.  She had switched off. I convinced her to switch off.  She's never been happy. She likes her Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She also wanted diamonds, so I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. She's a diamond girl.  Diamonds are a girl's best friend.  I think we can, let's take a break and we can come back and get your picture tips.  Good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, on Verizon, I can on Fios, I can get $750 slash $750.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $750? This is your wired.  $750 down my wire. Megabits.  Megabits. So you can't even get up to gig, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a gig. $750, $750. $750 is plenty. I'm now at $50, $50.  It's what? I think that's plenty.  Oh, God, yeah. The question is, I'm at $50, $50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, if you're happy with $50.  No reason to go to $100 or anything.  If you're happy and you know it, keep your plan.  Jake's at school. He's not using, you know, he's not running those BitTorrents.  I think you're all right.  Yeah.  We get from Comcast like $250 down on the consumer and $100 down on the business class.  But the business class is symmetric. No, it's not symmetric. Neither is symmetric.  It's not?  No, it's $100 down and about $15 up. Comcast is terrible.  But it's kind of, I think there's a service level agreement. It's more consistent. I don't know.  It's cheaper to get more bandwidth for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, we didn't talk about Amazon Chime. And that's really exciting.  Oh, we were going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Sorry.  So Amazon has decided, we talked about it on Windows Weekly. That's why I forgot.  Amazon has decided to compete with WebEx and GoToMeeting with their own meeting service and video service, Chime. Ding dong.  Would this work for us perhaps?  You know, we never used GoToMeeting because it was really meeting focused.  And Chime sounds like it is as well. But I'm certainly willing to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it because it sounds like it's one click.  And can I just tell you all of the tech we have today and we still can't make a conference call that I can join by saying yes.  So I'm really excited to try this out.  Meetings will call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it's time, they'll call you and you can tap.  So no more pins.  iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.  It's got chat.  You build per user per month.  There's three editions. Chime Basic allows you to make one to one voice and video calls to use chat and chat rooms on all your devices.  Chime Plus adds screen sharing and your company directory.  Chime Pro scheduling, hosting meetings, recording meetings, personalized meeting URLs up to 100 people, etc.  I wonder how much the basic is.  We could just use that.  Yeah, for this. I would I'd be willing to try it.  We're looking for a replacement for Skype.  Why do you think this is a big story?  Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it?  I think it does.  It's interesting because it pulls in Amazon's infrastructure.  Right. So can they offer this cheaper?  But two, could you have now that they're getting into voice plays, right, that puts them I don't know if they're using like bandwidth.com for the back end.  It says they're working with level three.  So maybe that's their back end kind of provider on the IP kind of telecom services side.  But when you have that, you could do like a call from your Amazon Echo, for example.  Not today.  But wouldn't that be cool?  And so that's that's where I think this could get interesting.  Yeah.  You're like, no, Stacey, that's weird.  Yeah.  Also, I just really hate dialing into conference calls and I do it all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I'm trying to think.  I think this is the one of the first times Amazon has used AWS with a front facing consumer facing product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless well, I don't know what Amazon video is.  Yeah. Yeah.  So Echo is I don't know what their video platform's on.  But yeah, no, this is it does use AWS infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should mention AWS Amazon Web Services, one of our sponsors on our shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have never seen them.  I'm sad about that.  Well, I should watch more.  I should watch other shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just had an ad on Windows Weekly.  I think they I think it's they're pretty new.  And they've been on Windows Weekly.  Not all advertisers appear on all shows.  Some some objects may seem appear smaller in than they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm hurt every advertiser who doesn't appear on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, this is the best show.  Close cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Striking batteries not included member FDIC.  I actually wanted to mention and I don't know if I have it on the rundown.  The great rebundling.  Did you read that piece for a while?  We were unbundling, you know, in music, for instance, Apple had forced the record  industries to get to kind of go to the 99 cent single.  Now, all of a sudden, we're bundled again because we're buying.  We're not buying individual records.  We're buying Spotify or Apple Music.  We're buying a stream.  This is Ben Thompson in the Stratecary.  He's talking about the great rebundling.  Same things happening.  You were talking about earlier.  You're you're in effect rebundling for a while.  The promise was you just buy a TV show, right?  But no, now you have to buy all these services in order to get the TV show.  We went from we all wanted a la carte in TV and music.  But instead, this is another view from Jeremy Phillips in Deal Book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the New York Times, a la carte is usually more expensive.  And we're we're a lot.  We always think we're not lazy, but we're pretty lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He talks about Craigslist, you know, siphoning off, you know, real estate listings and from the newspaper,  he says paradoxically, the same forces that allow classifieds and news to be so easily separated also drastically  increase the economic rationale for bundling across the board.  Consumers have merely swapped one bundle for another or often several.  There are more than 65 million subscribers to over the top packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV,  even Amazon Prime, even without Amazon Prime TV.  One does not always think of these as bundles, but but they're looking more and more like a traditional cable bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So it's just kind of it's a it is a little bit different because like with Netflix, I am well, no, I guess it's not.  It's well, it's cheaper. And I'm getting a why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the really sad thing is that we're now paying more again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends on if you if you rationalize.  So like we put our Hulu subscription on hold every now and then just because we're like, I'm not excited about it.  And then we so all we subscribe to is Netflix and.  Over prime members, so and then every now and then we pick up Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I meant to talk about that, but I didn't get to.  All right. Now, Stacey, it's time for your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this week, I don't have a thing because I'm actually playing with lots of things and nothing is working.  Oh, I know that. Yes, I'm having I'm having issues.  So instead, I am punting with I've already forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how the Pew report on algorithms, it says here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, actually, this is a really good report.  I had another thing that I didn't put it down and I don't know.  I don't remember what it is now. That's very sorry, you guys.  Oh, wait, did that work? The link is a dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the links dead. But I've got the front page. Oh, good.  Pew, it says algorithms are aimed at optimizing everything.  But experts worry they're putting too much control in the hands of corporations and governments.  This is kind of the thing we're talking about with the artificial intelligence, these kind of biases, hidden biases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I thought you guys would like it, because it really does.  It's an 87 page report, which you may not want to read all of it.  That's OK. But it does a nice job even on the first page summarizing what the big issues are.  And you can dig into any one of those. And these are like the things what's going to happen.  And they quote Kathy O'Neill, our favorite author.  Yes. And it's it's I mean, if you have the time and the interest, you should read it because it's a really good paper.  And it's it's not hard to understand.  So that's always nice, because sometimes they are hard to understand.  So that that's my pick.  And next time I'll have a I'll have either the Logitech Harmony stuff for you or I will have this magical Streeify flow I'm trying to create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll see. Is this kind of, though, a techno panic, Jeff, a little bit as we've talked about before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was talking so you know, there's a twenty seven million fund started at Harvard MIT, somewhere up there in Cambridge, for A.I. ethics.  Right. A little bit different from this. But but but as I was thinking about this, I was talking to somebody today who helped fund it.  And and the discussion that I had with I don't know if I had told you about the discussion I had with Google a while ago, where I argued that that the network.  Sorry, I'm getting into the brain space here.  I'm arguing that the platforms have to be more transparent about the manipulation that occurs to them in this fake news world.  I do not argue they need to be transparent about the algorithms because they'll get gained.  But they do need to be transparent about how people are trying to gain them and thus us.  This is a matter of transparency. We didn't know.  So point is, when I thought about that more, I realized that this notion of transparency in algorithms, this notion of we got to know what they're doing doesn't so much matter because we can't read them.  You don't know what they do.  But the principles behind the algorithms need to be published.  And and I think that's what people are missing here is there's no sense of the rules.  There's no sense of the of the standards that are given.  And in fact, you know, we do get some of that.  Right. We panned Panda.  Matt Cutts said this.  We're now going to degrade this.  We're going to, you know, reward that.  And that's the principle that's behind here.  And so we're telling you the behavior rewarding until you mess up gaming it.  So I think it's a bit of techno panic to say algorithms.  Well, newsrooms were algorithms.  Merchandising is an algorithm of a sort.  There's all these decisions that get made and on what basis we need to know more about the basis, not the formula and not to worry that I think it's all this who are dangerous stuff.  Does it make sense?  Yes.  He's back in board mode.  No, I'm back in what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm saying yes.  I was nodding, but I think there's a really crazy delay.  Do you want to do a number two, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I already had it, which you already had.  You didn't steal it.  You didn't steal it, which is a gift.  I did not.  So the number is one hundred twenty two million.  And we're going to get to where that is.  So a really, really charming, lovely thing in the Gates notes, which is the Gates Foundation, reproduces a letter that Warren Buffett sent to them in December 2016.  That said that he thought it was a good idea to write a letter about what they're doing in the process of writing that letter.  He learned more, he said.  And, you know, of course, Buffett is so open and generous about the 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a subtle back story to that, which is that Warren Buffett, 10 years before he wrote that letter, gave them the largest charity donation in the history of ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was kind of like, what have you done with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So like, I gave you my money and he even says, look, you can't judge a charity the same way you judge a corporation.  But I kind of like to know what do you he says, what do you think you've done?  What kind of difference is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a really kind of charming thing where they come up with these numbers and they have a written dialogue of Bill and Melinda about this.  So the first number is one hundred twenty two million, which is the number of children's lives saved since 1990.  And here's the methodology behind that.  It says that if child mortality had stayed at the level of 1990 in the time since one hundred twenty two million under the age of five would have died.  But instead, we've seen an improvement in young child mortality around a number of factors that really is a big difference.  It's amazing in a world right now where we can take some goddamn good news.  I'll take it. It's truly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, let that sink in.  Yes. Since 1990, one hundred and twenty two million fewer children under five died because of initiatives from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including inoculations, clean water, poverty, poverty.  People were dying because they were poor.  One hundred twenty two million children under five.  It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The number of childhood deaths per year has been cut in half since 1990.  Now, that means we got another half to go and we got issues, but but it's pretty damned amazing and wonderful.  So a couple of the numbers of the best deal is vaccines.  And I think that about 28 percent of children worldwide receive basic vaccines now, except in some parts of America where they've gone into a techno panic about them.  Yeah. But that's wonderful.  One million newborn babies.  The reduced newborn mortality.  Let's see. Last year, about one million infants died on the day they were born.  Wow.  A total of two point five million died in the first month of life.  But I'm not sure what the good news is here.  I guess it's just too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what we get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then malnutrition, 45 percent of child deaths are linked to malnutrition.  So that they show a picture in here of a line that shows where the standard, the WHO standard for nine year olds and the nine year olds in this photo below it.  Yeah. The issue of malnutrition all around.  Very important.  Melinda Gates number, French Gates number.  Three hundred million is the number of women in the developing world who use modern contraceptives.  And you may have seen this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She has pledged to replace all of the people who've lost coverage due to underfunding and defunding of Planned Parenthood in the United States.  Under you know who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's a really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this because it really shows that that money, and it's a lot of money, has made a big, big, big, big difference.  It's great.  And Bill Gates said this for a long time.  He was challenged because he was not a philanthropist and didn't give away money.  He says, I don't want to do it until I can do it right.  And the famous counter example is Mark Zuckerberg who gave how much to the New York City schools?  One hundred million.  One hundred million.  Yeah.  Kind of to no good purpose.  And so he does take work.  And Bill says, I'm not going to really do this until I retire.  Actually, after he got married to Melinda, she said, look, I'm going to do it and I'm going to convince you to start giving money even before you retired.  But now they've given away.  They've really done an amazing job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're true leaders in this.  They're absolutely inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a documentary on HBO about Warren Buffett that also talks about him and the money he's made and how he's giving almost all of it away as well.  It's really remarkable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite in this is actually one percent is the percentage of people surveyed who knew that extreme poverty has been cut in half since 1990.  People just don't know this.  The world is improving.  All this argument about how the world's in terrible shape and awful things are happening.  And there's other authors talk about this.  No, the world is getting better.  It's safer than it's been.  We're saving more lives than ever.  There are there are far more people out of poverty than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you read Steven Pinker's book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was just exactly thinking of.  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't read it. So tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's called The Better Angels of Our Nature, I believe.  And it's I mean, that is Jeff just summed it up.  That's why I was like, oh, Jeff, have you read this?  It's really dense, though.  I will tell you.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very good.  It is very good.  Yes.  Picker also did another.  What was the other book he did?  Oh, Matt. Matt Ridley did a book similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it less intense because OK, so it's the better angels of our nature.  Why violence has declined.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt Ridley wrote The Rational Optimist.  I think it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need some we need some optimistic stuff.  We need a little bit of optimism.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really the other thing in the letter that's just great.  Just one of those wonderful charming moments where they put it in a picture of Bill and  Warren in a McDonald's in Hong Kong where they were where Warren had because he eats,  I think, a bit like Trump does one to have lunch.  And you offered to pay, says Bill to Warren, dug into your pocket and pulled out coupons.  Linda just found this photo of me and the big spender.  It reminded us how much you value a good deal.  So it's a charming little moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.  Hey, I use coupons.  I'll be honest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you're not the third richest person in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, how do you think you get there?  Not by coupons.  I guarantee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that you've all been cheered up, I'm going to tell you how you can protect your privacy  against an over intrusive government.  One of the things people we haven't we didn't talk about politics at all today.  But, you know, one of the the current breaking news story scared me a little bit because  we've talked about the surveillance state in the years since Edward Stone's revelations.  We talk a lot about overreaching surveillance by the NSA and other state security organizations.  And what we're seeing happen play out right now is an example of our intelligence community  deciding to weigh in on the politics of the nation, not by going to Congress and saying,  you know, here's what we know and you ought to be doing an investigation, but by going  directly to the public and the press.  And it scares me a little bit because the one of the worst things that could happen  is a as a surveillance state using its knowledge and power against its citizens.  So let's all encrypt.  What do you say?  And this is a company, a website that I've talked about for some time, Keybase.io.  It's an open source.  It starts as kind of a PGP server so you can keep track of your PGP key.  You can actually make a key there and then distribute it and follow other people if their key changes.  But they've just released this week an app that does all of that and has encrypted chat built into it using your PGP encryption.  It's done right. It's very impressive.  Keybase.io. Here's the app.  And people have started chatting with me a little bit.  I've had some conversations already on it.  These are secure chats.  You also have a secure file system that you can have public information, but also have shared file folders with real people that are totally encrypted using public key crypto.  So only you and they have access to the contents of it.  You can attach your keys to your devices and you see I have many keys attached to many devices and manage them that way.  I understand that PGP is a little opaque.  The idea of crypto is a little opaque to people.  Very famously, Edward Snowden's revelations were delayed because Glenn Greenwald couldn't figure out how to use PGP.  And Snowden says, I'm not talking to you unless we can have a secure conversation.  This would be a good time to kind of bone up on the basics of crypto and how you can use it to communicate privately.  And I would suggest to everybody visit Keybase.io.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you think about the story that there were some who were complaining that government people were starting to use it?  That it's good and bad, right?  They're trying to avoid some protection by bosses they don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story was that people in the White House were using a chat app that destroys the messages as soon as it's received.  You know, like burn after reading.  I don't know.  You know, the problem is that what strikes me is that our republic, our experiment in this country is more fragile than we really realized.  And it relies upon a consensus and a willingness of all the people to participate.  And when there is a vacuum of power, unfortunately, what you see is people who want power kind of stepping in.  And it really scares me that the intelligence community has decided, rightly or wrongly, I'm not sure I disagree with it, but has decided to take down Michael Flynn.  This is an article from The Week by Damon Linker.  And he says, look, Flynn deserved to be taken down.  You know, I'm not a fan of Flynn, but there's something much more concerning here, which is unelected, unknown intelligence analysts using their knowledge and power.  The power of a surveillance state to influence politics is a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think, I mean, one of the challenges, though, is they couldn't leak it to Congress, which historically would have been what would have happened because Congress right now, one of our one of our stock, stop gaps.  What sort I'm looking for?  Backstop.  Backstop. Thank you.  Isn't working because Congress isn't standing up to the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks. I would say that the.  See, part of the problem is that this whole system is designed to move at a snail's pace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that might be good in certain cases.  I think it is very good in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think the intelligence community is, you know, the snail's pace could include nothing happens till the midterm election when people decide that they're going to vote the sons of guns out and replace them with somebody who will do something about it.  But for now, these are elected representatives doing what they were elected to do.  And I don't want to suborn them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I recognize the paradox of my position because I was enraged that Donald Trump was a government in politics, was trying to delegitimize Barack Obama and know he's the president.  And now what am I saying?  I'm I delegitimizing Donald Trump.  It depends in part on his behavior.  If we find out certain things, then, yeah, I'm going to question his legitimacy.  And if he does things that are illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need to use the process and not bypass the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the process is this is the problem now with some institutions.  The process is broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mistake then to bypass it because that's just going to bring the entire institution down around our heads.  Let's fix it.  I think it's happening anyway.  Well, it may happen anyway.  But that's the bigger question.  I would like to fix it.  I would like to take the power of money out of politics.  I would like to eliminate gerrymandering.  I would like to see fair elections and voting rights.  And then let's have those representatives do what they like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how the hell do you get from here?  You can't get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not by having spies release the contents of surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you at some point know if they know that if officials at all levels of there's another check and balance in the system, if you're saying that illegal bad things are happening that are dangerous to the country and you know it in government, don't you have a responsibility to let the public know?  That's what they're doing is letting the public know.  This is the problem.  And they're using the first amendment.  But we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like a complete data dump.  It's like selective choice of the surveillance we have.  That's what all leaks are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's where you appreciate reporters who know what they're getting.  I agree.  But yeah.  I worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just worry.  We have such a beautiful thing that we've created with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think every institution is mortally challenged.  Every institution.  Yeah.  And the reason we see the nation challenged, that's why nationalism rises.  I guess what Snowden did the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's not because I feel like the release of information from the intelligence community this time was ad hominem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it was the same thing because he found things that he felt were bad.  He says that he tried to take it through channels.  He couldn't.  So he went to the press and he trusted the press to do a good job with it.  So whoever did these did the same thing.  They said something rotten is going on here.  The system won't work.  And so that's why we have the press.  It's an institution, too.  It's the fourth state.  And so, no, I think it was it was legitimate use of the fourth estate.  Now, if you just took the stuff and put it up through WikiLeaks and put it up online and lies were lost.  Different issue.  But or if you did, let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We really are counting on the press at this point than to vet the material they've been given by the by spies.  Now we are to use it responsibly.  Yes.  And and and and then I think we all need to put pressure on Congress, which has full access to this is what's happening.  Yeah, this is this allows us to demand.  This is how it works.  Normally is we aren't privileged to know that information.  But but our representatives in Congress are and we expect them to act upon that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. What you're getting what you want, Leo, in the end is that the dribs that come out into the press put pressure on Congress to say we have to hold a decent inquiry, which has not happened yet.  Right.  But if they're pressured enough to do so, then they will they will do their job and they were forced to do their job by this process.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, another rumor that Snowden might be handed over by the Russians as a gift.  Thank you note.  I wonder how is it that Snowden ended up in Russia of all places?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, well, don't forget who helped convince them to go there.  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glenn Greenwald?  No.  Laura Poitras?  Assange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Julian Assange says one report.  Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is why conspiracy theories start, because don't you feel like there's a lot going on that we don't know beneath the surface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's always a lot going on that we don't know beneath the surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the natural desire is to project upon that some story, some explanation, however far fetched.  I guess the vacuum leaves room for lots of things to be projected.  Anyway, enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We came so close to not having politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is very germane because we talk we've been talking for four years about the Snowden leaks, about the surveillance state, about how to protect yourself.  And I think it's appropriate at this point to do what I did.  And all I really intended to do, which is to raise the warning that this is the fruit of, in some respect, a poison tree.  That's all.  And you guys may.  I don't know.  You guys.  I think that's what I wanted to do.  Both of you made excellent arguments of why that you have to consider this.  But I just I think we should raise that issue.  And I don't I don't know if anybody else is going to talk about that.  And everybody should get a burner phone and use PGP encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not and not take your phone abroad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's another scary story.  I don't know.  You know, we're traveling abroad.  We're going to Cuba at the end of the year.  I won't buy a phone.  I'm not bringing my smartphone and computers to Cuba.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buy yourself a burner, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what you know.  Exactly.  Not that there's anything on my phone that see, that's the other side of it.  There's nothing on my phone.  I would hide that, you know, I was just in principle.  I don't like it.  What do you mean?  You think did you put something on my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but the data from your phone can be used to determine all kinds of crazy things or someone could plant something on your phone while it's in there.  I mean, if we're going to get paranoid and talk about conspiracy theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good point.  Well, at least I'm not a NASA scientist.  Those guys are strange.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  All right.  Now we got it in there.
