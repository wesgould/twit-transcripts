Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig.  This week in Google, episode 101, recorded June 29th, 2011, inside Google+.  It's time for Twig, this week in Google.  And boy, what a big Twig this is going to be.  Let me introduce our regular panelists first.  It's Twig+.  It is Twig+, literally.  Jeff Jarvis is here from his office at the City University of New York.  He's the author, of course, of What Would Google Do?  and professor of journalism and blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  Gina Trapani is also here from San Diego, California.  She's at SmarterWord.org.  She's been using this brand new thing for a full 24 hours.  She's our expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we do have two people on the show been using it longer.  Let me introduce in the upper left hand corner, Bradley Horowitz from Google.  Hey, Bradley.  And what is your relationship to Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big fan, big fan.  Big fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you're a little more than that.  Vice president of product and was part of the team that helped build this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  And Vic Gundotra, who's also very well known at Google and I think a happy man right now.  Hi, Vic.  Yeah.  Hello, everybody.  We also have kind of a hangout going on.  I don't know if you know this, but we've got quite a few people, including Matt Cutts from  Google.  I see Doug Kay there.  There's quite a few people waving Trey Ratcliffe, Robert Scoble, quite a few people in there.  Oh, wait a minute.  There's my there's the werewolf.  Okay.  Dylan Field is in there and he was a werewolf, but he's not anymore.  So this is this is a part of Google plus called the hangout.  Who wants to who wants to start?  Vic, do you want to start or Bradley?  Do you want to give us?  I need somebody to give me a thumbnail of what this is.  This is probably the biggest Google product launch in quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why don't I start off by just giving you a little bit of a description of what our  goals were?  Okay.  And then we can dive into the various aspects of it.  Okay.  You know, so we recognize that a basic human need is a need to connect with other people.  And of course, we do that all the time.  We smile.  We talk.  We we cheer.  We connect all the time in real life.  And unless like you're in solitary confinement, right?  But increasingly today, people are connecting with each other online.  And yet when they connect online, their interactions are not like the real the choices that they  have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm starting to lose your audio.  I'm not sure what's going on there, Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hear some background noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you hear me now?  Let me cut the back.  Now you're good.  It's better.  Is that better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay, good.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  So when you look at the online choices that we have to connect with people, they often  give you very rigid choices.  One tool allows you to speak publicly to everyone in the world.  Other tools force you to put all of your connections into a big bucket.  And it turns out all those people are not really your friends.  And so we thought, you know, there's got to be a way to do this better.  And when we talk to our own friends, we talk to our own families, when we looked at market  research, we consistently heard from people that they want to communicate with different  circles, that in real life, how you communicate with your closest friends is different than  how you communicate with your co-workers.  How you communicate with your sister is different than how you communicate with a neighbor.  And so we asked ourselves, why is it that that doesn't exist in software?  That richness and nuance that we have in real world communications, why don't we express  that in software?  And we recognize that in some respects, it's just hard.  People don't like having to go create these circles.  And so we really tried to develop a tool.  And this tool is at the heart of the Google Plus project, which is the ability to create  these circles.  And we had Andy Hertzfeld, who is one of the original members of the Macintosh design team,  really help lead a team that built a breakthrough UI that makes it very simple for you to not  only have lots of connections in your life, but put them in the appropriate circles.  You know, a family circle, a friend circle, a Napa buddy circle.  And then that concept is core to everything else that the product does.  And I think you talked about hangouts.  And since you're showing them here, I'll briefly talk about how circles relate to hangouts.  You know, we recognize that when groups of people want to connect, when you want to connect  with people that matter in your life, today that is largely a newsfeed or stream-based  activity.  And we asked ourselves, why can't you go higher fidelity?  Why can't you do group video chat with the people that matter in your life?  And we argued that there was three things that were holding back group video chat.  One is it's expensive.  You have to pay for group multi-user video.  Number two, it's complex.  You have to call your father and help him install the software and get through the permissions  and shut down the antivirus.  And it's too complicated.  And we said, what if we made it free?  What if we made it easy?  But then people do group video chat.  And we said no, because there's a third reason why people don't connect that way.  And that's because of the social awkwardness problem.  You know, you try to do group video chat.  You send someone an invite message, and maybe they're not dressed appropriately.  And then, you know, then they have to say no, and your request is rejected, and you  feel bad about interrupting them.  And so what we decided was what happens in real life?  In real life, people give subtle social signals that they're available to chat.  It's unlikely we're going to knock on our neighbor's door at 8 o'clock at night just  to say hello, because we might be interrupting them.  But if our neighbor is sitting on a porch, well, we're much more likely to go, you know,  hello, Bob, because his sitting on a porch is a subtle signal that it's OK to talk.  And if two neighbors, if Bob is sitting on his porch and your other neighbor, Mark, is  talking to him, then it's almost rude to walk by and not say hello.  And so we built that into software.  With Google+, when you start a hangout, a notice gets put into the stream, and you can  decide which circle gets to see that.  Maybe just your family circle or your Napa buddy circle or all your circles.  All of them get to see that you're hanging out on your porch.  And whenever someone's available, why they can join you.  And it's amazing.  We see the exact same dynamic.  As soon as two people are in a hangout, pretty soon three people join.  And it turns into a party very, very quickly.  And we support up to 10 people in a video hangout at no charge.  So that's a quick overview of the Google Plus project and one aspect of the Google Plus  project hangouts.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Vic.  And as people watching the video, as we went through this, we showed a little bit of my  interface to this.  It was very easy to set up.  There's a plug-in you download.  And it really is.  It's kind of amazing.  I'll turn up the audio briefly so you can hear it.  There are 10 people in there.  So it's kind of a party going on.  I could have sworn there was more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where were there, Scoble?  There was a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're on air, guys.  There we are.  Okay.  Now we're on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everyone goes quiet.  Everybody got quiet.  It's really, it's quite a thing going on in there.  Hey, Robert Scoble.  And I noticed, Vic, also the focus shifts automatically to the person who's speaking.  There's Matt Cutts.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  You also can mute your mics and you can mute mics of somebody who's being very noisy and  disturbing the room.  It's really, really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, so that got quieter when I did that.  That's Robert Scoble explaining how this stuff works.  So you want...  I would never mute you, Robert.  And there's an empty chair, apparently talking right now.  So you launched this, Vic, yesterday.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we went to limited field trial mode yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How limited?  Who's, who...  It seems like a lot of people I know are on here.  Scoble's already added a thousand friends.  Of course.  Mostly Googlers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the friends that he added were people that were already part of our initial seed.  And we chose the initial seed very carefully.  We wanted a lot of diversity.  So we have people that represent over 42 of the world's languages that are in that initial  seed.  Trying to really test the product, make sure that we meet people's privacy expectations,  that the systems are working, that we can scale.  And we'll slowly grow that initial seed as we're ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People can get invi... or ask for an invitation by going to the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you get it, you suddenly get on your Google...  Well, actually, I think everybody's getting this now, this black bar.  Is everybody getting that on their Google page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, this black bar is a new part of the interface here, but if you are part of the PLUS experiment,  you'll get the...  Maybe I should call it experiment.  The PLUS...  Project.  Project.  There we go.  Because I gather not fully experimental.  Although my interface to my computer, apparently, is you'll get the PLUS and your name there,  and you can click that to go right to PLUS.  How many people...  How quickly do you plan to roll this out more publicly?  How many people are going to be involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, we're not disclosing any numbers right now.  We're just working with our initial seed.  We're watching how the systems react.  We're measuring certain characteristics, and we'll have more announcements in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Looks...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the thing that everyone asked last night, and has been asking me today that I asked  Bradley last night, is apps yet?  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it is a very...  It feels, as I play with the stream, it feels very Facebook-y, very...  Or friend-feedy, or buzz, in a way.  And yet also more social.  I think the circles really does solve that list-making problem.  Even Mark Zuckerberg has said that we want different groups, but nobody wants to make  lists.  This kind of crag and drop interface really is kind of fun to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is.  That's what we were trying to do, is we were trying to eliminate the awkwardness that some  of these tools have.  Right.  And so, we tried to make the circles fun, but you'll see that subtlety all through the  product.  And I think you mentioned earlier that in the Hangouts, the camera switches automatically.  We realized that the higher-end telecommunication services that corporations use often have  this camera switch capability, and so we tried to bring that down.  Because in the real world, people interrupt each other's conversations, and the conversation  jumps around.  And so, the software recognizes that the conversation is jumping around, and it tries to move the  video with that, which I think provides a really fun experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you using video as a back-end for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are not.  I'm assuming you're referring to some of the codec work that we're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I was under the impression that G-talk uses the video.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is not that.  We are not disclosing which codecs we're using at this time, because we're actually  experimenting with a couple of different options, and as we go through field trial,  we'll make various engineering trade-offs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hangout also allows you to jointly watch YouTube videos.  Gina, you said you were doing that last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it works really well.  If you watch a YouTube video together, if someone skips ahead, the person you're watching  with skips ahead, that happens for you too.  It's very much an instinct kind of, you know, it's a group activity you're doing with your  friends.  I would love to see screen sharing.  I'd like to pair program in a Hangout.  I'd like to use a whiteboard and, you know, listen to music.  So it's a neat, I really like the YouTube functionality a lot.  I want to see it do more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt's playing with his bucky balls right now.  You can see the party, the fun element of this, but Trey Ratcliffe, who's a photographer  and has a website stuck in customs.com and uses Hangout, or has been using Hangout, with  his work friends who are distributed all over the country, said it's also very useful  for them because they just leave it up and running and then as they need to communicate,  they can.  So this isn't pure fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it seems to be that when it came to work versus fun in the release so far, fun won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bradley, I take it you've been using this.  Yes, fun always wins, doesn't it?  You've been using this for a while.  Have you, as you've used it and as you've seen new people come on, have the use cases  changed and shifted a little bit, or are you surprised at how sometimes people are using  this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think the most surprising thing about Hangouts was that even though for the last  few months as we've been testing this, we've been trapped in a work scenario, it's just  been our colleagues, fun just sort of erupted.  All kinds of traditions emerged around Hangouts.  Vic, you know, even other executives would, there we go, Matt Cutts is, this behavior,  like for some reason, you know, you put people in a Hangout like this and all kinds of hilarious  behavior ensues.  People were in Hangouts for hours and hours because once the originator leaves the Hangout,  the Hangout can keep going.  I like that actually.  And so it's the last eight hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Robert Scoble was mentioning that and I think that that's a subtle but valuable  feature of this.  Nobody owns it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good design decisions.  I'm going to make a sign that says I'm with stupid and hold it up when I go on a Hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we have, we have, this is Hangout.  We've shown you Circles as well.  And then there's, then there's Stream, which is a stream of content going down.  And then there's Sparks.  Tell us about Sparks, Bradley.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google knows a lot about the content that's on the web.  Obviously through services like Google Search and Google News, we have fresh up to the minute  content.  Sparks allows you to express your interests, your sort of durable interests.  I'm interested in hiking or scuba diving or whatever esoteric interests you want.  There's a free text search there.  And we will bring you fresh topical content suitable for sharing.  So if I type in IBM to the Sparks interface there, we're not going to bring you the Wikipedia  page for IBM or navigational queries for IBM.  We're going to bring you up to the minute news stories regarding IBM that are topical  and meaningful for today.  So we think that one of the things we want to do with this product, it turns out to be  really great for conversation.  In other networks, it can be sometimes hard to have a meaningful, threaded conversation.  You can do that here.  And we want to sort of give people an icebreaker, a spark to the conversation, and then allow  them to have meaningful conversations that aren't filled with spam or random people sort  of chiming in, but are contained in these circles.  And we've certainly seen that in our testing that sort of has upleveled the quality of  conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's not Google Alerts.  In fact, it looks like this is going almost a search of Google News.  Is that accurate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a subset of Google News?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google News is included.  The corpus behind this is custom.  So it's nothing you've seen before.  And we're continuing to tune it and figure out what content belongs in Sparks, whether  it's YouTube videos or news stories or blog postings.  All of that is fair game.  And then we're tuning the relevance.  The things you may want to share with other people might be different than the things  you might want to read privately.  So we're continuing to use machine learning to tune the relevance to bring things that  inspire this kind of sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is so I've added two interests.  I've added movies and Android.  When I go to Sparks now, will I see a stream of movies and Android?  No, I continue to see these these suggested.  On your left hand column, your left hand column.  So I'll have to click.  So there's no collation of all of them.  I'll do one by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There should be.  I mean, Leo, you're right on.  I mean, the welcome screen that you see there is basically a placeholder.  We will do something much better and more interesting than that.  But when you click on Sparks right now, you see those suggested Sparks, those, you know,  cycling and Paris.  We're just trying to give people a flavor for what the product can do.  But you can imagine that we will have a much better combined relevance rank stream that  will be a better experience for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is always it's funny because on this show for a long time, we've one of the complaints  I've had, I said Google needs to hire fewer computer scientists and more social scientists  because now we've got all these great technologies.  But it's so complicated for an end user to grok what's going on and to implement it.  And it's clear that Andy and your team have put a lot of effort into thinking about how  humans will use this.  But it sounds like this is an evolving interface.  This isn't you don't consider this done by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, field trial is the right term.  We're not.  That's not a euphemism.  There's a lot of rough edges in there and a lot of learning we have to do.  The feedback we've gotten in the first 24 hours has been tremendous.  I mean, even if it's stuff we've heard before, the chorus of people debating it and all of  that informs how we prioritize getting to this work.  So our ears to the ground and we're very excited about the level of engagement and the feedback  we're getting from folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One more feature to mention and this is the photo sharing feature.  And it's essentially is it automatic?  This is what I'm not sure.  Would you explain how photos works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  We had this insight after talking with, like I said, our friends and doing some basic research  is that people were finding that they had photos and videos that were abandoned on their  phones.  Yeah.  And we asked them, why didn't you just copy the videos and photos over?  They said it was just too hard.  Sinking your phone to your computer, recognizing it as a USB device, copying the images onto  your machine, putting them scaled down into the right program and then sharing it in mail  This was just all too complex.  And so we put in a feature called instant upload.  And for Android devices, that means with your permission, whenever you take a picture or  you have a video, we will upload those in the background to a private album.  And it turns out to be a very magical experience.  If you come back then to your computer, any picture that you have taken in the last eight  hours is instantly available for you to share.  It literally shows you small thumbnails and you can just select those thumbnails from  the party last night and you can just share them really easily.  People who have used this feature claim that they're addicted to it.  It really simplifies the entire workflow of using your mobile phone as a camera and then  later sharing those assets.  Currently Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  You're explicitly choosing what to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's correct.  Everything is put into a private album.  Nothing gets shared automatically.  That's kind of important, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People do all sorts of things with their camera phones they may not want to share publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vick or Bradley, talk a little bit about the privacy.  One of the memes about this so far has been that it's, I won't compare you to Facebook  on privacy, but there's a lot of privacy thought in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Vick said thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your, of course I want to mention here that I have a book called Public Parts coming  out September 27th, Simon & Schuster, but we'll get past that.  That's the privacy goal of Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Bradley, you want to take this or you want me to start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll take this.  I mean, I think one of the things we tried to do was understand users' unmet needs.  Gina wrote a really wonderful, thoughtful post this morning.  Some of this is informed by mistakes of our past.  Some of it is informed by primary research we did with users.  But people really do care about how they are represented online.  The current systems fail to meet many users' needs.  We heard this again and again as we asked.  And one of the things we tried to do is make privacy not something that's sort of nine  settings deep where you sort of set it and forget it, but to pull the basic tenets of  visibility and who's in the room and these kind of things that the physical world sets.  You know, in the physical world we have walls.  And I know that if I'm in the room with three people, my sound isn't going to go through  the walls and reach people on the other side.  And in the online world, it hasn't felt like that to date.  When I look at a share box, I really have no idea who's going to sort of receive this  on the other end.  And so we're just trying to reintroduce some of these basic concepts like specifying an  audience or when I take a right gesture to comment on something, I deserve to see who's  in the room and who can see this at that moment in time.  So privacy is different.  It's not like a setting.  It's an approach toward building the product that sort of integrates this in at a feature  level.  And we think that's something users want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to let you guys go because I know we're using your time and we really, really, really  want to thank you for being part of this.  But before I go, I should ask a question that our chat room is asking particularly about  APIs access to this data.  Is there a fire hose people can get?  You know, this is one of the complaints people have about Twitter.  Certainly you've had about Facebook is lack of access to this data.  Who owns this data?  How can we get to it?  Is there an API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So obviously we are a platforms company.  We believe that the data belongs to the user.  And so you should expect those APIs to become available.  Right now we're in field trial mode and our primary focus is on building a great experience.  If it isn't a great experience, there will be no users.  And if there are no users, the API access won't matter.  And so we're really focused on making sure that it's a great experience.  But you can be assured that we are also going to have a platform.  In fact, we're simultaneously working on that and we'll have something to announce in the  future.  Absolutely critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And finally, how can our viewers get invitations?  You got any invites for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can go to plus.google.com and you can sign up.  We have an unbelievable number of people already signed up.  I bet you do.  And just be patient with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think what we've done is we've created an unprecedented demand for this because I think  as people look at this and how you can use it and the hangouts and the and just the features,  I think there's an unprecedented going to be an unprecedented demand for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, clearly this is going to get more real the more of my friends I can actually have  on.  I mean, I have a disproportionate number of Google friends, which I really quite enjoy  and I'm getting into a whole new world, but I can't get the full sense of it until I get  more of my world in there.  So the sooner it's big, the sooner it's real.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has been doing an unbelievable job of customer support, answering questions.  I mean, almost every thread.  I've seen so many threads and even hangouts where Google are hopping in and answering  questions really.  Please pass on to them that I think they're doing an unbelievable job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, like you, the fact that you gave such good advice to your users, people like Mark  Pinkus gave as long suggestions about what to do.  It's really impressive to see in a beta culture when you put it like this, the suggestions  and the help people give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also want to thank you for the Android app and ask, is there an iOS app in the future  or other platforms?  Yes, there is an iOS app.  What a surprise.  I figured there was, but I figured I should also ask.  I was just playing with this on Eileen's Nexus One and I'm going to put it on my Android  phone immediately as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want it because of huddle.  Huddle is the Android app only, which is really neat.  I can't wait until my lunch buddies or I'll have the huddle app installed because then  we'll be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The huddle app will be available in the iPhone version as well and it also works with your  friends who just have plain old SMS on their phone.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I wanted to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We didn't mention huddle.  Yes, explain huddle.  It's group messaging, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Group text messaging, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, thank you for having us on the show.  Thank you, thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Senior Vice President for Social for Google, Bradley Horowitz, Vice President for a Product  at Google, thank you so much for joining us.  We really appreciate the time you spent talking about this and congratulations on an exciting  launch.  Thank you guys.  Take care.  Bye bye.  Plus one.  Yeah, I still have my badge from Food Camp.  Thank you, Bradley.  Now I know what it means.  Unfortunately, when he gave me that plus one badge, I went, I like this and I don't know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  if you'll forgive me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You always get in trouble, Leal.  Meanwhile, the Hangout is still going.  This is really, you know, I'm trying to be a calm journalist and not gush and effuse  over this, trying to find the flaws, trying to be negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially after I said that, pardon me, Gina, Wave was going to change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Gina in her article said that right up front, you know, that she's a little gun  shy.  We're all a little gun shy.  clear.  They said it, but I think it's it's bears repeating is they have learned a lot from  Buzz and from Wave and from other launches that didn't go this well.  In fact, that's that's the name of Gina's article.  What Google Plus learned from Buzz and Wave?  What did they learn, Gina?  What are they doing better?  What are they doing right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this product, these Google Plus, this Google Plus suite of products has a lot of  good design decisions that are very evident.  And so in my article, I kind of run down.  I mean, there are so many mistakes that are made in Buzz and Wave.  Wave launching without email notifications to get people to come back to it.  You know, as soon as as soon as the press was saying, it's not that impressive.  People weren't, you know, were waving back and not seeing their replies.  They weren't getting email notifications.  This you know, the way that Buzz kind of just landed in your Gmail inbox and was this giant  add on and made all this noise.  You know, Google Google Plus isn't this single monolith that was like Wave, but it's not  this, you know, invasive add on either.  It's this separate suite of products that you that you can opt into.  It's plus it's extra.  And, you know, I just it feels like they just there's a lot of thought that went into it.  And, you know, no one wants to make lists of friends, not even me.  I'm the organizer.  I get a lot of satisfaction from organizing.  No one wants to make lists of friends.  But the fact that Google was able to let go of its focus on speed and efficiency and let  Andy do his do what he does best in that that circle interface, that chips interface, dragging  and dropping people onto a circle.  It is so sweet.  The leading a circle is just so delightful and neat.  You want or see, this is the thing.  Time Machine does this well, too.  Like no one wants to back up your data.  Right. But Time Machine is really cool.  It makes it fun. I think circles makes an organizational task, which is kind of a pain,  really easy.  And what I also like about this is that up front when you're sharing, you have to say,  who am I sharing this with?  Which circles am I sharing this with?  Now, I believe that Facebook, you can make lists in Facebook.  I'm not even sure if you can share selectively with lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But in groups, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have a group, but it's not it's sort of you have to really know the product well.  And it's sort of buried.  This is what I like. I really like about circles that up front and center.  You're saying I'm showing this to my mom and my brother or I'm showing this to Jeff and Leo.  And I really dig that.  So I like that Google.  I think this shows a lot of evolution.  There's this is this is the iteration three, I think, of their major social social apps.  It doesn't look like a GWT, you know, the Google Web Toolkit design, you know,  doesn't have the Google Voice, Google Wave, email design.  This is gorgeous. It's beautiful.  It looks really nice.  And I too, I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic.  The reality is that social products are only as useful as how many of your friends are in it.  Right. So this remains to be seen what adoption is going to be like.  Right. But I mean, just hang out alone for me.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I was thinking, I hate being alone in my office all day.  I'm going to find a co-working space.  I need to see more humans hang out.  Well, that'll be something I'll have on all the time.  Yeah. And for my coworkers at expert expert labs and my former life hacker.  I mean, I'll be able to see my friends talking more and talk with them face to face a lot more.  And in fact, I think it's interesting.  Last night, Jeff and Vic and Bradley and I were in a hangout.  And that's actually the first time I've ever had a chance to talk to Vic directly.  I've seen him at conferences and I've always been too intimidated and too scared to walk up to him.  But then suddenly Google Hangout.  I was talking directly with Vic.  I was a little intimidated.  But Jeff asked Vic and Bradley to be on Twig today in Hangout.  And there's something there's a social pressure about being asked something face to face in front of nine other people.  And they both kind of paused because they're both busy men.  They paused for a moment and then they just said, OK, you know, like you could tell that if we had sent them an email, they may not.  They may have ignored it.  No, they could have ignored it.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, Gina, I also looked at you because I was I was making an executive decision here,  not sure whether this was the right thing to do for the show.  Kind of, you know, is that OK?  And Gina says, yeah, you know.  And so this the signal that the human cues and signals each got all around became really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a really, really interesting moment.  I was thrilled that you asked because I didn't have the guts to ask.  I was like, of course, this is what this is what a real journalist does.  Right. I was like, oh, my God, it's Vic.  I'm a New Yorker, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been in California too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess so.  I guess so.  I was like, hey, you're going to join us or what?  Get in here.  Hey, get in here.  I should have done my book that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I talked to Tim Shea, who's the head of NextDo Networks, which is bought by Google.  And he said, I said, think about it.  We just saw it.  So then hang on.  I hadn't seen Tim in a year and a half.  So I got to reconnect with him, which is part of the magic, let's remember, of Facebook and Twitter, too, is you reconnect.  And so I talked to Tim and he was talking about this.  And he said that even though I'm seeing this is very social, he said he hasn't had a phone call with anyone since he's been at Google.  All he's done is hang up.  Interesting.  Everything is this.  And that's how it is all communication that he's had.  It's just nobody wants to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I find this very exciting to be honest.  I'm thinking of things.  Tim was at food camp, as was Bradley Horowitz, as was Gina.  And Gina, one of the things that struck me is that you can have little mini food camps.  One of the great things is meeting, seeing people in real life, the ability to do these hangouts and see these people.  We could even play werewolf in here.  I see Dylan Fields in here.  We could even play werewolf in here.  I mean, it would be this is I don't know how we do it, but we'll have to they need a werewolf button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a private I am conversation going on with the.  So are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt and Dylan are in, by the way.  So I just think this is really intriguing.  And boy, you can read and Scobel's not.  You can really you can really see the design, the UI put into this.  I think it's it's kind of boy, I don't know if it's all Andy, but this is unique.  Look, here's a dog cat.  What is that? Will's got a animal of some sort.  He's holding up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's marketing.  There's no ads visible now.  Not yet.  My my editor, Simon Schuster, when he saw this, said, oh, can we do a book party on on plus for?  I don't know. A certain book coming out September 27th and seven issues for public parts.  And Pyrrhus available now on Amazon.  Yes. And so, you know, can you can you can you imagine getting together with new kinds of focus groups?  Imagine customer service here.  I'm sure in a huddle of people running problems with my computer.  You know, you just start to start to I swear I always go too far.  But but what other kinds of communication besides just hanging out make this possible?  I mean, Gina, you really hit on something there.  You know, Vic Condulter's box is the same size as Gina Japani's box.  Yes. There's an equalization there.  There's no stage here.  Everyone gets the stage when they say something and they don't get interrupted.  And that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's it's pretty darn interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Hangouts, they definitely they did they did they did great with Hangouts.  The stream is not that different than than Facebook or Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It feels like friend feed. It feels like Buzz.  It feels better than Facebook because I have more control over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. But it's irritating because any it defaults to giving you any post with recent activity.  So Vic's post last night that said, wow, congratulations, team, as all of his employees sucked up to him and said, yeah, thanks, boss.  I pumped that up to the top of my feed constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was a buzz problem. That was a big buzz problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't learn that one from Buzz. And I and I want more options to decide what it is.  I thought incoming was just new posts.  And then somebody from Google said, no, it's not.  It's kind of people who I'm not following.  I want a few more controls there. Not not defaults, but just let me see just new posts.  Let me see current activity.  Let me see stuff you recommend. Make that very clear to me.  The names, as Gina said last night, are really nice and human and cute.  But sometimes they need a little clarity, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's let's keep let's keep nitpicking, understanding that this is nitpicking.  What else is wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the main thing is siloing, which is not necessarily their fault.  But how is this going to connect to Twitter?  How can it connect to Facebook?  I want to be able to post one thing.  I mean, I was I was still feeling like it was a little bit of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hence the API question. If they provide an open API and access to the firehose,  there's nothing to stop Twitter from federating with this, right?  Which should be fine. I mean, I think that that's the key.  So that's the question. And that's why it's an important question.  I didn't mention this to Vic, but that came from Lou in our chat room who works at Microsoft.  So I think that there's genuine interest in this.  And, you know, if they do the AP, why wouldn't they do it right?  Because unlike Facebook, unlike Twitter, they're not trying to silo.  It's in Google's interest to get all of these companies to federate. Is it not?  Is it in their interest? They want to drive traffic.  Isn't that all they care about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's in their interest to get users.  They really want to get users. And this is I have to say, I'm really,  I'm really glad that the focus is on users first and then developers.  Not I mean, I'm certainly interested in the API and I'm dying to integrate this  and think up and all those great things. But but, you know, I think there's something about  we don't want another buzzer, another friend feed where people just sort of pipe  their Twitter posts and Twitter, their friend feed posts.  We want you know, they Google wants people to be interacting on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the difference between Buzz and Plus in Buzz.  Buzz became just another Twitter because everybody was pumping their Twitter into it.  We're not proposing that.  We're not saying that Google should suck it from Twitter.  We're saying Twitter should steal away from Google.  That's a big difference, especially from Google's point of view.  In fact, it might be the reason the Twitter doesn't do it.  They don't want to become an also ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I want to I want to pump out to Twitter and let people know.  And in fact, that was what's happening when when Tim or when somebody else  put up a hangout, they put it on Twitter.  Oh, yeah. Publishing a hangout on Twitter. Bad idea.  Well, but you only get 10 people.  That's true. But you get the first the first 10.  The first 10. But if you're like, you're really lonely  and you only get in with the URL. Right.  Part of part of what I don't understand here is that  there's two things that I haven't got my head around yet.  Well, there's more than that. But I'll list two now.  One is that this is a sink. This is not Facebook.  It's a sink like Twitter in that I can follow people.  They don't follow me.  But I don't understand all the implications of that.  Right. If I follow Robert Scoble and what Scoble doesn't follow me,  does he see what I say? I don't see what he says.  I don't understand that.  The second is when I make something public,  what does public mean as opposed to just one of my circles?  But when it says public, how does the world see that?  Does it does this have the potential to be Twitter  and that I can follow lots of people who want to go to the world?  And where do I find that? And how does that work?  And of course, I can't yet because it's a closed test.  But those are the two things that are really confusing me so far about Plus.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan just did a post.  I don't have the URL on me, but about he  about how public Plus posts show up in search results.  So right now, I think that you can search.  You can use like the site colon plus dot Google dot com  advanced operator and search for search for Jarvis. Let's see.  And then, yeah, so like I'm getting posts  posts by Jeff Jarvis. Yeah. In Google Plus.  So so Google Plus public post will show up in search results.  And I'm sure that they'll show up even more once we're out of the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in that case, I want them to show up on Twitter, too.  And I actually do want them to show up on Facebook, too.  Facebook probably won't allow it.  But if Facebook lets Twitter in, why wouldn't they let this in? Right.  So I want that end of it. Right.  What was the other thing I was confused about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm looking at Danny's post here.  Anything that happens with Google Plus can be made public with the world  if someone chooses to do so.  So when Scobel declared he'd friended over a thousand people,  he made that public. And you can see it says public, of course, right there.  Of course, everything Robert does is public.  And then presumably Google does, you know, do a good job of of of spidering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google. Oh, I know what I was asking the asynchronous nature of that.  OK, so so Leo, if you and I put Robert in our circles,  we will see what Robert says to the public world,  but we will not see what he says to a circle of neighbors.  You know, right.  I don't know. Let's ask Robert.  If Robert doesn't see him in a circle, Robert doesn't see me.  Go ahead, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's absolutely true.  If I share an item with just my family  and don't put it to the public feed, you won't see it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, that's as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Go to the next level, Robert.  So if I follow you, I will see anything public you say,  but you will not see any public I say unless you follow me. Right.  OK, so it's a it's a it's a it's a refine.  It's Twitter with circle that I'm not sure about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what happens is if you take a picture, I just get the sense.  Let's say I'm following that cut. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that cuts is a friend of yours and that cuts is following you  and you share something and he plus ones it.  Does it put it in my view? I believe it does.  Oh, Matt.  Is Matt in there anymore? Yeah, he's he's right there.  Yeah, that's the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead. Speak to us, Matt.  This is so cool.  I'm going to use this from now on on all the shows.  Ten of you will get to talk.  How's it going? Hey, Matt.  Hey, Leo.  Leo, this is your video.  You're going to be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, Leo, this is your video.  What we call stuff. This is freaking cool.  This is exactly what we talked about last week.  With all the corner cases, you can mute people and you can chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really pretty nice.  I'm going to try to compose myself and be a a journalist here.  But it's kind of hard not to jump up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm going to leave this running on one of my machines 24 hours a day.  And people can just see if I'm there or not.  I am too. Yeah, actually, yeah, actually hang out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's automatically shut down after a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, is it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we'll tell us who you are, Will Norris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we so I'm a developer advocate or developer programs engineer at Google  working on the Google Plus platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he knows in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you explain this async to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That means we don't get to watch Robert on that bed in the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Gary Kay, by the way, the deep voice coming from a studio.  So, Doug Kay, Doug Kay, Doug Kay, Gary Kay is an old friend.  Doug Kay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's a matter of, well, am I right that if your friends of,  let's say, Leo's and Leo shares something in public, I don't see it.  But you plus one, as it put it in my view, because I'm calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good question. I'm not 100 percent sure.  That's very buzz. That's very busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't believe that simply plus one will expand the apple.  Oh, dear. And this is the problem of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. I'm just going to mute that.  We were for a while. It was working nicely because I think Robert, help me.  Did I have do I need to mute everybody and unmute people as we speak to them?  How is this going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, somebody needs to meet themselves or we need to figure out who's noisy and we'll meet them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. So I do have I see I have these granular mute controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I can probably the problem was that somebody was watching your video.  Streaming and I'm speaking at their mic open. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't do that, unfortunately, which is a little bit of a limitation.  I guess you could do it if you wear headphones or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why that's why I'm wearing headphones and have a good mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And then there's otherwise like we can't hear Jeff in the hangout.  You can't. You wouldn't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can make that that would be a bad thing.  We can make it so you hear Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. If you feed Jeff and Tina,  Jeff and Gina into the and into the Google plus audio, then we'll all hear that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am doing that. And then it's utopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Only if you get you die and go to heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so Leo, we were talking last week about having a wall of screens  where you have Twitter listeners able to come in and join and talk.  Google just made it for you. Yeah, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is fascinating.  Yeah, there's so much I can do with this.  But but it's not it's not specifically me because really this.  Yes, there's a broadcast value to it.  But what it really does is it solves it.  It's a social thing that works socially and in intriguing ways.  You know, this one of the things that strikes me is that a company like Google  has so much clout and these products have such widespread use potential.  You know, this could literally be used by a billion people  that it can change society.  Yeah, here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, don't you think?  I know what I always do.  I'm trying my best not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Habermas would have said  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really interested in like kind of the cultural,  like behavioral effects that these kinds of things have.  Like I really like Vic's analogy about someone hanging out on a porch.  The thing about a hangout, though, is that it's a moving porch  because there is no host or owner.  You know, it just sort of lives as long as there's someone in it.  It lives. And and so Andy and my co-worker, Andy and I were hanging out today  and we were talking about, you know, what are the kind of social conventions  around popping into a hangout and leaving a hangout?  Do you say goodbye?  Can you pop in and really not say anything and just lurk like you can an IRC?  And so last night, Jeff and I were on a hangout and a Googler  who I won't name was saying that one thing that's been happening  internally at Google is that, you know, hangouts have been sort of  happening all through the night.  And there are these kind of young young Googlers and interns using it.  And so eventually someone says something flirtatious  or there's some sexual innuendo.  And so that the new the new thing that people do is they show their hands  when that happens. Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So already we've got a new cultural culture, like somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody says something dirty. You show your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's that is really interesting to me.  You know, what are what are the conventions?  Am I going to am I going to leave this on and with my coworkers  at the hangout and just sort of walk in and out of my office?  Look at they're all showing their hands, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Handshake, handshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is, you know, it's kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This solves this part.  We I held myself back and not using this word  while the two esteemed guests from Google were on.  But this solves the penis problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I almost said that and then I thought better of it.  But I did. I did, too. I stopped myself. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but but it's you know, it is the chat roulette is that identity  is interesting. It's just enough identity.  You know, somebody well enough.  It gives you enough control to mute them.  It really becomes far more proper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There can be anonymous people in here, but they're friends of friends.  So, for instance, I started this hangout.  I don't know many of the people in here because Robert  then added a bunch of people. Right, Robert?  So that that. Yeah.  What is that symbol?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's the hangout wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's starting this.  I have to say this is starting to feel a little bit too much like the Gilmore gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's really getting a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has a Gilmore.  Well, in some ways, though, I say that in a positive way.  I'm not required for that.  No, but it has the value of the Gilmore gang.  It would be somewhat more controlled situation plus video.  I mean, I think this is very intriguing.  I mean, one of the things I like about the Gilmore gang is the is the large group  and the somewhat anonymous ability to add people.  But Robert, these all these people are your friends.  So they're friends of friends.  Now, can they then add somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I wouldn't call them friends.  They're people I found  on the on the street corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you have the penis problem and then you have the Scobel problem.  It's another problem entirely.  We need a new sign.  In my first four hours, I found twelve hundred people on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. I can't believe you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We need a new sign for Robert.  This is the Robert sign.  It's an S Scobel problem.  No, but but but this is friends of friends.  So it's not completely anonymous.  And if somebody does do something untoward in here, they are they are  in somebody on here's circle.  Nobody's disconnected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you can report them.  There's a red hand underneath everybody's picture,  and you can report them to Google and say this this person's naughty.  Oh, that's the naughty hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I see. I tried to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, it was all this time.  If I got into a fight with Robert  and I wanted to just knock him out because I want to talk to everybody else  and he wanted to knock me out and still talk to everybody else.  That's again an asynchronous thing that we didn't want to do it  and actually report somebody.  We were trying to figure out last night, what are the what's the rules  that's built into the software around that?  Matt, do you know?  Matt Cutts, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Matt, you're that's trying to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was I was he was making a sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put it in the mirror.  It's backwards.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just asked the chat room where they were jealous of the hangout.  I think they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we'll use this. I'll tell you what, we will use this on Twitter like crazy.  This is I mean, I could say my mind is reeling with the possibilities here.  Yeah. And you know, one thing that always kind of made me sad,  I wanted to use, as you know, friend feed, I wanted to use buzz  and they just didn't take off.  And I ended up back at Twitter and I've never been fully happy with Twitter.  I keep hoping somebody will come up with the next thing.  And this some in some respects, is it too soon to say feels a little bit like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not sure it goes that far.  And I'm not looking at it that way.  Good. It's fun.  I mean, this is something that Google hangout is something you can't do with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So right. Or Facebook, I might add.  Now, how big a threat to Facebook is this is is Mark.  Jeff is Mark Zuckerberg quivering in his adidas shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Malik wrote.  Oh, Malik wrote today that that they shouldn't be worried.  Facebook shouldn't be worried.  You know, the problem is, I think we have to ask why Google's doing this.  And part of what I believe and part of what I think Omen said, if I remember,  it was his, is that this is a lot about search.  I have been arguing that the war now is over the best signal generation.  How do how do companies entice us to generate signals about ourselves  so that they can better give us relevance and targeting in content, services  and advertising? And Google finally admitted  and realized that they didn't have our lives.  They didn't have us as people.  They had us as words and questions, but they didn't have us as people.  And they have to learn more about us.  So there's going to be the fight that says, oh, Facebook has,  you know, 600, whatever million number of people, 100 million people it has now.  And Google will have pick a number, 100 billion.  They say, oh, Google lost.  That's not going to be the calculation.  The calculation is going to be how we use Google, how we think of Google,  how Google can serve us better, how Google learns more going forward.  And so, you know, what is I think what I would ask instead about  Facebook is not a numbers game.  Certainly Facebook is going to look and they better have this video feature fast  or something equally as cool. Yeah.  But I think that, you know, I actually think that one of the very interesting  things about about this is sparks.  I went through and found stuff about newspapers and journalism  and the odd wonky things that I want to know and did immediately  add them to conversation.  People did immediately pass them around and it added more substance than,  hey, I got drunk last night,  which is what has been interpreted as social.  So it adds. Try this on.  It adds substance to social.  So I think Zuckerberg has to say, how does he add new functionality  that they have here? How does he add substance to social  and give us more control?  I think that the whole notion of being able to create circles.  Facebook might well have done it, too, but the difference for Google is simply that  it started from day one.  Once you have a thousand friends in Facebook, you were never, ever,  ever going to organize them.  So a long winded answer with absolutely no conclusion.  I don't think Facebook is necessarily scared.  I don't think that the war here is going to be over raw numbers.  I think we're going to see some really interesting competition about features.  And I think it's going to be really good for both of them, including Twitter  and Twitter clients and Foursquare and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's interesting. I just played with sparks in that way.  I picked an article and I shared it.  When you share it, you you actually it's this is really kind of intriguing.  You have a choice of sharing it with your existing circles,  adding a circle, extending a circle or public.  And you can do several at the same time.  So I can I can add public and then and say, oh, and by the way,  send it to my family, too,  and email for people not using Google Plus.  So this is a very granular, very kind of, I think, powerful sharing system.  So I agree with you.  Sparks is maybe a dark horse here that has some interesting potential. Certainly.  I guess it's the conversation starter. Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems to be what the name kind of sparks a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Gina, we're all being cautious here.  We're all being Leo started go off the edge. We pulled him back.  Thank you. So close. I would have lost.  And I'm there, too.  I really because, you know, you saw  the potential in wave.  Is this less profound and slicker  or is this as profound as wave could have been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wave was trying to solve  problems that people who were on mailing lists and use wikis have. Right.  And that's a kind of a small group, I think, of superpower internet users.  I think that plus one is really trying to hit  mainstream folks who want something, who are frustrated with Facebook,  who want something better than Facebook.  Have you seen the XKCD  cartoon about about Google Plus?  It was, you know, somebody says you should try Google Plus.  And what is it? It's not Facebook. What's it like?  Facebook. And it's like, oh, yeah, that's exactly what I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want something just like Facebook that isn't Facebook. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like Facebook that isn't Facebook.  So I think I think that wave and plus are trying to solve different problems.  I mean, there's the broad stroke problem of like collaboration.  I mean, wave is more about collaboration, collaborating on documents.  Plus seems more about connecting people.  I'm kind of obsessed with Hangouts, which is this, you know,  feels like a very strong, strong connection.  But huddle is something that I'm really looking forward to.  My lunch buddies, I can't wait to get huddle.  Oh, that's the group messaging group messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that available now or is that something I have to wait for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's available now in the Android app only, and it will be in the iOS app  and it will also integrate with regular SMS.  So it'll be easy to set up a lunch buddy circle and say, hey,  where do you want to meet today?  So so let's put it this way.  Plus is trying to tackle a much less geeky problem than wave was. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so here's a so here's the here's the huddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. There's the interface. Tap on huddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I think Jason Howell has has already created one.  So I I see this message.  It came in as actually what looked like a text message,  but it had the Google Plus notification sign next to it.  Why isn't it on the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interface. Yeah, it's a good question.  It's not in the mobile web interface.  I mean, I think it's supposed to really they're kind of positioning it  as group text messaging.  And yeah, it's only available.  In fact, definitely getting the feeling from iOS folks  that they're feeling a little bit left out or not being able to try huddle.  Because it's Android only. Can we add a video to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Watch out, FaceTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to tell you, this show is the reason why I got so excited  about Hangout is because because I just feel like video video chat,  group video chat is such an intimate kind of way to talk and meet with people.  I was really shy about about video chat before before we started doing twig.  And then when I saw Hangout, I was like, yes, exactly.  I'm going to do my own twig that isn't broadcast.  And this is, I think, an important thing.  The fact you can't record a Hangout or, you know,  unless you're using screen recording software,  it lets you talk about people who came in and left.  You know, when you go into a Hangout, there's also a text chat on the left side.  If you come into Hangout, you do not see what people said before you came in,  which is interesting. It's a very ephemeral, you know,  just a conversation at a cocktail party.  If you're there, you're there.  And if you're not, you miss it kind of thing.  And I really like that. This isn't about productivity.  It's not about journalism. It's not about broadcasting.  It's about just hanging out. And and I dig that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just figured out how you could play werewolf with it, too.  All right, everybody put your head down.  Now werewolves wake up and see they'll look up.  You got to trust everybody. Yes. See, look, see this.  I knew you were a werewolf.  This is really this is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Leo, take what you just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just there's the awake check, by the way, since I haven't done anything.  It says, are you still here? And I have to say yes.  OK, so like a dead man's switch.  Yeah, dead man's switch. But I don't know.  That was an hour and I think, yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so so one thing you could do here is I could imagine the network  deciding that you could have a mini sub show. Right.  Right. You could just have a Samsung tablet people pick their own 10 people.  And because they can't broadcast to the world through Twitter, you could.  So I'm saying, right, hang out.  So it extends this extends this into a public form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can do that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make it make a hang out public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should broadcast. I should probably get I should have asked Vic, but I guess it's  he he kind of by his silence gave me permission.  I wonder if there is in the license  agreement something that prevents me from doing what I'm doing right now,  which is broad rebroadcasting this out.  Surely not. It's it's how could.  Well, I probably have to put a message up that says, everybody, by the way,  you're on the air. Oh, that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's that's not a licensing issue.  That's a Google licensing issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Seth is showing us his tablet version of of this.  Is that huddle in tablet form, Seth?  Speak so that we can hear you so we can see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can you can click on what do I click him if I just double click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I click on it makes it makes the main one.  There you go, Seth. Show us the tablet again.  I don't hear you. I don't know why.  Oh, because I muted you. You foolish me.  Go ahead, Seth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was actually showing you Robert's, I guess, message post.  What is what is the unit of a shared thing?  You get to name it, Seth. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mona, it's a Mona.  Let's call it a Mona.  A Mona. It's good. I like that very contient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So. Zeke Weeks in Twitter just said that,  however, we might solve the penis problem for chat, but not for politicians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just think of what Representative Weiner could do in the hands of Weiner.  That's terrible. Oh, my, oh, my.  Terrible, terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd have his hands up all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Will. Will's got his hands up. OK, Will.  This is fun. This is really.  I could see getting a lot of work not done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been the same.  I just wanted to go into a hangout.  It really is.  Well, the other problem I have is I feel like I'm living in the middle of Mississippi now  because I'm looking at my Twitter stream, I'm looking at my plus stream,  I'm looking at my Facebook stream, not to mention my frigging email.  A little bit of RSS. Remember that? Yeah.  You know, it's just life.  It really has become profoundly afloat.  And you know, I talk about process versus product all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what does that have to do with Mississippi?  I'm sorry, I missed the analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all a stream. It's a huge stream.  Oh, I get it.  You feel like you're living in a river.  Yeah. Sorry, but that wouldn't have worked very well. Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The muddy, muddy Mississippi.  I get it now. I understand what you're saying.  Old man River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just old man Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy. You guys should just do your own hangout.  We're going to. Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should have an old men hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could empty the hangout. Yeah.  Hangouts for singers. Oh, karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Oh, come on.  Let's get let's get the hangout room to all sing one song.  Let's see if we can do it right now.  The first karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not going to work so well because they're all there's some latency.  So what song are they going to sing, Jeff? You get to pick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, the loudest singer will win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Because only we only hear one one audio thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You only have one time. Oh, that's right.  OK, never mind. It won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm muting them again. I don't want to hear it.  All right. Let me get back to the philosophy.  Any good technology to succeed, to continue on, to be used has to be generative.  Yes, it has to.  And we're seeing this already  in many ways.  It creates new uses, creates new thoughts about how you might use it.  This is this is absolutely generative technology.  I would say I would venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it as generative as Twitter was?  Not yet. Or could it be?  So Twitter, Twitter became generative  to the extent that people could set  could set standards, right, and could act on them.  You could search on hashtags. Yep.  I don't know that I see that yet here.  It'll be interesting to see how people try to try to extend this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will. I mean, the hands up behavior is sort of is sort of the new  retweet, I guess, a lot less useful, but kind of fun and private.  There's not a lot of search going on here.  I mean, this is viral and so much is that if you share things in your stream,  the fact that you've shared it will show up in my Google search results.  I mean, there are sort of subtle hooks into other places.  Like so I'm going to assume if I search for Android  and Leo has posted something from his sparks, he shared something.  I'm going to see that right in my search results.  So that's going to be that's that's there's some virility going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is very intriguing.  I think that what we're seeing is something brand new  that has some huge potential. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask you another way.  Gina is developer queen of the developers.  What would just knowing what you know, so write something.  What would you write?  What APIs would you want out of out of what do you want?  You're going to get your hands into. Yeah. Great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is that is a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could you you could write tweet up for this? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would definitely want to integrate this with ThinkUp.  So I think pulling public posts and pulling posts that are revealed  to circles that I'm in doing the kind of sentiment analysis  and conversational analysis that we're doing.  I mean, you don't need that as much here because, you know,  this is threaded discussion.  So I can post a prompt or a question to my followers or people who are,  you know, in their circles, and I'll have that conversation in a particular view.  I definitely want to search through things that my friends have said,  things that, you know, I have a circle called my inner circle  who are like my super trusted VIPs.  I would love to be able to search through just things  that they've said about a particular topic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really still kind of kind of thinking about what what else.  Now, what's interesting about this, did you guys read Stephen Levy's Wired piece?  I really recommend it.  Kind of the background, it's a long one.  It's like eight pages on kind of the process of building Google Plus.  From what I understand, the four or five products that launched yesterday  are just sort of the beginning.  And, you know, a lot of other things have launched previously,  like plus one was part of this.  It's going to be the Emerald Sea.  I get that was the code name for their social effort.  So I'm interested to see what else they've got brewing  and what else is going to come out like like hang out, you know,  being able to watch a YouTube video together. That's cool.  I also want to be able to listen to music, like I said, like turntable.fm.  I want to be able to pair program.  I want to be able to share a whiteboard, that kind of thing.  So so this seems to lay the groundwork for that possibility.  Again, now, social stuff doesn't matter unless your friends are there.  So it'll be really interesting to see.  I'm going to Twitter really competed for my attention from,  you know, from plus in the last day.  Is that going to continue or when I spend more of my time?  It'll be interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It feels more like a place you actively play in than. Yes. Yes.  A place that you see Twitter.  I don't actively play and I might it's not as compelling in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, here's another way to put it. I scraped Twitter. I don't. Yes.  Yes, I think you're right. You're probably this is this is where  I don't know if I've said this in the show before, but when I took  the son, Jake, with me to interview Zuckerberg  and on the way there, Jake said the wall wasn't something entirely new in society  and Zuckerberg himself disagreed.  And of course, I'm going to side with Jake here.  Jake said, well, what happens there is people are having conversations in public.  And that's what made me realize that I didn't look at it that way.  I see the Facebook wall and Twitter by by reflex as a place to publish or broadcast.  I see it as media. Right.  Jake doesn't see it that way.  Jake and his friends see it as as truly as conversation.  It's the water cooler. And you use things to feed that.  It's their water cooler. It really is.  Yeah. And it's their society.  Yeah. And it's where they do this.  So two people have a will have what appears to be a private conversation,  but in public. And that's new.  So my point is that I think PLOS is built more around that model  of the water cooler than of the newspaper.  And Twitter, you know, what I talk to Ed, Twitter,  he really sees Twitter as a news and publishing tool.  And I guess what it's built as. Yeah.  Facebook turned into.  Yeah. So this is something in between the two where I can put in substance,  I can put in content, I can do all those things.  But the reason to do it in PLOS is to socialize.  It is to be with people. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certain people. Yeah.  I mean, Twitter has I mean, the pictures, primer privacy settings are binary.  You read the protected or your public and most people are public.  I thought the Facebook wall was based on the whiteboard  that college students put on their dorm, put on their their residence halls  door so people could write on.  I mean, this just introduces multiple hallways.  You know, I've got my twig hallway where where you guys live.  And then I've got my my family hallway where my mom and my brother live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that this  you know, PLOS stresses the fact that people have multiple hallways.  I mean, I think when you have a social network like Facebook  built by someone in college whose most significant life experience  is college, that there's one hallway, you know, where you live. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really right.  And I think that I've watched myself and of course, I'm Mr. Public.  But now that I have the chance with everything I post with one of the buttons  there, I'm making virtually everything public because that's what I do.  And I'm used to it from Twitter and I'm fine with that.  The reason that I make something public to a smaller group is not so much privacy,  but to not annoy everybody else.  If I say something to the twig group, it's probably not because we have super secrets,  but it's because this is only relevant to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, I mean, I can imagine planning the show in my twig circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we imagine that in Wave 2.  I hate to point that out.  Reality check.  We imagined a lot of things.  I mean, when I first heard about Wave, actually, when I started using it,  it was pretty apparent immediately that it wasn't going to be useful.  But for what we wanted to do.  But when we first heard about it, I thought this is exactly what we're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said it was going to change all of journalism.  You know, I went way overboard.  But that, you know, that this notion of privacy doesn't become a negative.  It becomes a positive in the way you just put it, Gina.  I can choose to go down this hall and just shout to those people and not bother everybody else.  Right. And so the privacy has a  an active benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you one thing I like, unlike Twitter, I can edit my GD posts.  Typo in here. There we go. That's better.  You can change history, Leo. I don't know if I like that.  This this has some they this is very buzzy.  You know, I got to wonder what a wither buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's here's my here's my tweet on that buzz was buzz was was was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just fill it WUZZ or W.A.S.  I like that buzz was buzz was. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's I think so. I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of potential for integration here. Right.  So I'd love to see this supersede buzz.  I would love to see more integration out to talk and to contacts and to SMS.  I would love to see Google Reader kind of integrate with Sparks  and the sharing and liking and favoring and commenting there to also feed into this.  I mean, I mean, Google has been throwing a lot of stuff up against the wall  in different silos and tied into calendar.  Yeah, tied into. I mean, yeah, there's so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could you could schedule a hangout hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, think of all the people who are disenfranchised.  Does Hangout have whiteboard capability or?  Yeah, screen sharing.  Because, I mean, if you're go to meeting, you're scared by this.  I mean, there's the the the potentials here are to to be a real disrupter.  Yeah, huge.  No, and Google's percentage in this is the same as it is with all other apps.  Just the more you use it because signals and signals.  There's because there's no ads.  We should have. I should ask Vic.  But I presume at some point there might be some ads.  But do they even need to put ads in here? Because you're right.  They're getting what they were missing was social search.  We've said this many times that they were going to get lapped by Facebook  because Facebook could merge search with social or Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at it this way.  I you look at Twitter is trying to figure out its ad model.  But at some point, brands are using it.  The best buy is using it to have a relationship with people. Right.  So could I could imagine joining a Samsung hangout  if I have a problem with my Samsung product and the Samsung rep  should go in there and say, oh, let me explain that to you folks.  Right. So the commercial value of plus may be highly relevant,  highly voluntary, highly opt in marketing relationships  and customer service relationships. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. I mean, Googlers are doing that right now.  And they're hopping in and out explaining how to use the product now.  I mean, they're really setting setting an example for how to do good  customer service and connection.  I mean, there's no better connection than seeing someone's face  and hearing their voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Did that automatically tag it or did you tag it?  OK, so I'm sorry.  Didn't mean to say anything, but we there's face recognition tagging in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And in photos, right?  It'll it says encourage you to tag folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because this is the photo I just posted.  So they put up the facial recognition. Oh, well, I don't know.  Is it facial? OK, no. So Gina, you're not named.  So I guess it's by hand.  Maybe maybe. But but it's not just me. Anybody could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it says click, click to name the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me name you. This is interesting.  And then look at this on the on the right, the comment thread.  By the way, I like this comment from Taylor, Tyler Gillies.  Buzz was the day it came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to we're going to incur the wrath. Watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, so I type G and it finds found you in my circle.  And so now it's tagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The facial recognition is really easy to facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, but it's easy to layer on photo details. Rotate left, rotate.  This is the capabilities built into this.  By the way, this was not manually uploaded.  I took the picture.  I then went to my photos and I was able to look at it  and do things to it and share it immediately.  Yeah. So this happened right after I took the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, I turned off the option on my on my Android device  to do automatic upload because I didn't I don't understand it.  Now, of course, I turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I haven't turned it on because I feel a little skittish about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The wiener moment.  Leo, Leo, does that photo now have a public URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, interesting. I don't know.  You know who might know?  Let's let's let's ask Will in the in the hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used to ask the chat room, but I'm not going to have anything anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Will. Yeah.  Well, I was I was actually trying to tell you.  Yeah, I actually went in and tagged myself and I tagged Jeff  pretty much as soon as you posted it. OK.  So it's not doing automatic face recognition. Good.  I actually went in. Is there a public URL for these pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I presume there is a permalink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you posted the picture publicly, I did be able to.  Yeah. If you the little arrow in the top right of your post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So public posts have public anything as permalinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would correct. Well, actually, all all those have permalinks.  It's just that you can only actually see it if you have permission to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it says link to this post and see.  Now I have this link with a long  GUID, GUID.  All right. Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so that means this is my new social flicker.  Be worried. Oh, interesting.  Facebook has, I think, ten times the number of photos the flicker has.  Well, it's certainly putting, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Picasso Web was has been around for a long time, but suddenly Google's  a big player in the this is the comment thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the upload is really interesting to just the like passive streaming  from from phones automatically.  That's Matt Sweeney speaking.  Matt, that's a totally different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt, who are you? Are you a Googler as well?  No, no, just an early invitee.  An early invitee. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, you have a green you see the green box  around the person in the main screen.  He'll stay in the main screen until you click off the green box. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I get it. So I've so I've made will permanent.  But now he's nobody.  And he thinks a lot, Leo.  That that popped up briefly.  This is really interesting.  I love the chat that's going on as well in here.  You see these little bubbles pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The facial recognition is pretty interesting, too.  There was an article a week ago where someone found reference  to facial recognition in some of the early source,  you know, like the publicly viewable source code on buzz or something like that.  So I wonder if it's one of these things where it's very, very real capability,  but that's not being surfaced for sort of PR reasons in this first iteration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We also have Sylvan Weber watching from Google Paris  and Trey Ratcliffe asks a question of you, Will,  how can I share into my stream an existing photo in a Picasso album?  Is there is there yet cross linking from Picasso?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when you first activate your account,  you're given the choice to connect it to your Picasso account.  I don't know the details of exactly what that does.  But when you go to the share box and click the photo icon,  you should be able to select from an existing Picasso album.  OK, I believe you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'll reiterate, if you're just tuning in, that Will Norris,  who you're looking at right now, is is one of the people on the team  working on Google Plus are all is the whole team will right now in Hangouts  or or on Google Plus helping people  interacting with users, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if the whole team is.  I would imagine quite a few people are, certainly.  Yeah, I'm actually sitting here at home.  So I'm not even at the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I just got a Twitter from Samson  Jessica, who likes the idea of using this for customer service  and wants to try it out soon.  Yeah, Comcast cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now you can see the face of the person. Yeah.  What does that do to the relation of the faceless corporation now has?  You don't just have a name for the man of voice.  You're going to look him in the eye.  That's really it.  That goes back to what Gina was saying about about, you know, being  being there on the equal footing with Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And asking him face to face to be on the show.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it goes back to my Dell hell with when Dell  went when Dell bloggers came in and started dealing with people on their problems.  People were just amazed. Right.  When Gina and I were in our little hangout last night.  And here comes Bradley and then Vic.  He just came back, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's just Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there you are. Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just you knew we were talking about you.  You had a system to tell you that, didn't you? We know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we need we need like the ears are burning feature now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Forget forget face recognition.  I want they're talking about me recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we've got real time  speech monitoring of all the hangouts in place.  So stop it, Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't even joke about that, man.  Do not even joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not right.  Bradley Horowitz, VP Google products said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, wait a minute, we're still on Twitter, aren't we? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're in public, baby.  So, hey, let me ask you, I wanted to I forgot to ask you this.  Is there any restriction on rebroadcasting this hangout as I am doing right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you're a test case here.  We I don't think we've gone into this yet.  And mostly it's a social contract between you and the people in the hangout.  That's what we figured out.  You've probably got your ducks lined up and clearances  from everybody in this hangout so that you won't get sued.  So, I mean, I think the biggest liability would be to you individually. Right.  So, you know, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, can I ask you one more question?  How do you get the wide screen? That's cool.  What's that?  You got wide screen there, Bradley. Why are you doing that?  What's wrong with why?  You know, that's good.  Everybody else is four, three, you're 16, nine.  I don't understand how you're doing it.  Everybody else is four, three, you're 16, nine.  I don't understand how you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know either.  Talk to our engineers. I'll compliment them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's well done.  Yeah, we did some.  All right. I'm going to I'm going to mute that just briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's here's another tweet that I like.  Jason Seipe, S.E.I.P.P.  says that imagine the implications Google Plus can have for education  and online classes.  It's just Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tutoring sessions, lectures and tutoring sessions.  Chat on the side.  This this blows up education, which would be a good thing.  Yeah.  Somebody else has a Twitter.  Leo, don't you have any commercials today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, this is we've decided to do as a pro bono.  We've decided to do a commercial free show today  so that we'd have as much time as possible to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, the audience is grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, actually, I do have a couple of commercials,  which I have deferred because I think we I think we want to  we don't want to take the time on commercials.  We really want to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is more the most interactive, coolest twigs  I think we've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am I'm just telling you, I mean, and and and just to have,  you know, people like Bradley hanging out  in the in the hangout there is pretty amazing,  pretty incredible.  I'll tell you what we will.  We can wrap this up here.  I mean, we didn't cover any other Google News.  We didn't do a tip or a tool or a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't mean to, you know, bring an end to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was this was the story.  I think that we have the story of the week.  I think this may be the largest, most important Google product  release in that I can remember.  And certainly since our show since since we started twig.  For sure. Wave buzz, even Android.  This is huge. This is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Android.  All right. Maybe Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there is one other story,  which is that Andrew Rubin tweeted that Google  is activating now half a million Android handsets a day.  A day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know a lot of people in plus in the plus field test  who wish they had Android for, you know,  for for the instant upload and huddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I think it's great that Vic immediately jumped in  and said, yes, we're doing an iOS version.  But you got to think there's a little bit of a little bit  of people at Google would say, don't hurry too fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to take your time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pesky approval process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Steve may not like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's here's the thing that we want to bring Bradley back  again last night, but I think that the thing that that people  like us really want is integration with Google Apps accounts.  Because I'm now in this with my lesser account.  And Bradley, you said last night that that, yes, you're well aware  of the of the pressure to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I would say it's the single biggest  Yeah, it's the single biggest bit of feedback we got was that  a lot of our best and earliest customers are Google Apps customers  and we have cut them out of their opportunity to use their authentic  selves in this product.  We're going to fix that. I promise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Well, how is that going to work?  Probably that. All right.  So now, but I'm establishing an asset with my work account  when I can switch over to my real account,  which is where all my real people are.  How do you imagine that my work?  But I have to restart over again or what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope not.  I agree. We've created a challenge in that people's identities are often siloed.  I use multi logins to manage the different aspects of myself.  But when you, you know, sometimes also people  invest in their apps account and then they leave the university  and they want to take some of that with them pursuant to the, you know, IP  who owns what we have to solve these problems.  We have to give you a way to migrate your data out and get it where you are next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not just the silo.  It's not just a siloing, Bradley.  I think it's also just the fact that I don't try to silo.  It's not because of that.  I don't want to keep them separate.  But I do, you know, I also don't want to lose.  I actually I wanted the opposite of siloing.  I want to merge them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it. That's probably a technical challenge. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see that there's already data liberation.  X download your circles and contacts option and plus settings.  So that's great.  That's great to see this early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that we came out of the gate with that.  Thanks to Brian Fitzpatrick and the data liberation front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The reach of Fitz is broad.  Yes. Hold your hostage until it was done.  Fitz, by the way, brought a brick.  I'll do an ad Fitz bought a brick in the twit brick house  that's going to have the data liberation front logo on it,  which I think is awesome.  And I'm glad to support that.  I should have just give it to him for free.  But hey, you want to spend the money. It's OK. I'll take it.  Bricks dot twit dot TV, if you want your company's logo on the wall at the brick to it has.  Hey, Bradley, I want to thank you so much and Vic, too, for being part of the show  and then coming back, which is even better.  Let me ask you the question that I asked Will earlier.  Are you find a lot of the team, a lot of Googlers are out there in Hangouts.  Online talking to people, helping users, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, yes, the team is really enthused.  And, you know, as you can imagine, we haven't disclosed numbers, but  an abnormally high fraction of the people you're interacting with right now are Googlers.  Right. So the whole company along with us,  you know, that will change over time.  But we're doing this because we want to listen and engage with people.  So you will find us being extremely interactive.  And everybody's prepared and ready for that.  We're talking with the engineers and the designers and the product people that built this.  They're engaged in every thread.  So please give your feedback directly to them.  It will make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Bradley, for being part of the show.  We really appreciate it. Thank you, too, for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the most awe inspiring things of this whole thing was the incredible secrecy.  All the speculation over the last two years  about Google and social and man, you you obviously imprisoned your employees  for two years. It's amazing. Get away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think people believed in what we were doing  and were excited about what we were doing.  And as such kept a secret.  And, you know, the only leaks that were material,  there were some, you know, buzz about circles three, four months ago around  South by Southwest.  A fair amount of detective work was done on some of the JavaScript  through profiles, you know, sprites were reverse engineered and,  you know, some some things leaked out.  But in general, the story that we told yesterday, I think, surprised most of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I envision 500 Googlers coming out of a basement right now,  seeing the sunlight for the first time in pubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this has been this has been a lot of fun.  I really I want to thank all of our, you know, kind of ad hoc  contributors in the show, including Will Norris,  who's on the on the team for Google Plus, Trey Ratcliffe,  our great friend of photographers from Stuck in Customs dot com,  Robert Scoble, of course, a Scoble lizer and and Gary K.  I keep calling you Gary Doug K.  From the Conversations Network for joining us and adding their two cents.  And already we see the value of Hangout.  Just just pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I just said on the chat room chat room, we still love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm just going to have to get another computer.  The reason I haven't done much with the chat room is because they're on the same  computer as the hangout is.  And so, guys, we haven't we haven't left you.  I like what C.R. said.  Hangout is the chat you date.  I.R.C. is the chat you marry.  What is the chat you kill?  No, no, no, no. In fact, there's nothing like I.R.C.  is kind of remarkable.  It gets it's it is one of the oldest Internet protocols.  I think it predates the World Wide Web.  It is considered by many to be the geekiest, maybe after Usenet.  And yet it is very effective and we've used it very effectively.  I think there's going to be a lot of other ways that we can use this  in conjunction with other social things.  But I'm pretty excited about Google+.  I think there's a lot to be said about.  And I think you, Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani for joining us and talking about it.  And for Jeff, I thank you for the invite, because it was your invite that got me in.  So I appreciate it.  I think I got to thank Karen Wickery.  Karen sent me 15 invites and we did, in fact, invite the team.  But mine didn't go through theirs did.  She's maybe because that Google Apps problem could have been that Google Apps problem.  But I invited a number of people using their Google Apps address.  So I have to fix fix that.  We also want to thank our friends at NewTek.  You know, we are building a new studio.  You probably heard a little bit about that.  And we have many, many partners who are helping us out with technology  to make it possible, none more important than NewTek.  They make the switcher that I use to do things like this and this  and this and this.  And that switcher is really critical to our operation.  We're getting a mighty big upgrade.  We've been using a TriCaster broadcast for the last few years.  We are now getting the TCXD850.  This is the new high def, completely redesigned, super powerful TriCaster from NewTek.  It's basically a live production truck in a box.  22 channels, 4U rack mount system.  It's going to give us high def.  It's going to give us capabilities that you will not believe,  including 18 HD live virtual sets.  We can do sound video titles, stills, motion graphics, finally.  So when I say Jeff Jarvis and your name flies in, Jeff, don't get scared.  Don't get tacky on us.  No, no, I could have gotten tacky before.  I have the tacky capabilities built into this existing TriCaster.  You know, I can I can do things like this.  But do I?  No, you don't. Only once in a while.  But yeah, we there's a lot more we can do.  And by the way, a lot of people use TriCaster, including Kevin Pollock,  his chat show, Peter Himmelin's surest world MTV, ESPN,  the NBA Development League, WNBA, Fox Sports, the NHL, a lot of churches,  a lot of youth groups, a lot of organizations.  For more information on TriCaster, visit New Tech, N-E-W-T-E-K dot com.  And really a sincere tip of the hat to New Tech, because the TriCaster has  been a really valuable part of the network.  And we want to thank them because they have essentially donated  and an 850 to our new production facility, which is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're they're revolutionizing television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We couldn't do it without them.  I mean, really, I couldn't even consider this without something that I could afford.  I bought this TriCaster was 10 grand at the time.  And, you know, that's sounds like a lot of money.  It's a million dollars worth of production facility in in a box.  Jeff Jarvis, his new book is coming out in September.  How exciting, Jeff.  We're thrilled. It's called Public Parts.  Can't wait to read it.  Simon and Schuster, when are we getting our press copies, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want you to have the galleys because there's mistakes in there and drop types.  So when I get the the real books, I'll send you autographs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can't wait. Really look forward to it.  And I would appreciate that autograph.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff is also blogging at Buzz Machine dot com and he's at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.  Gina Trapani, of course.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoopsies.  I make I make.  Flip.  Well, she is dizzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Gina Trapani, the dizzy Gina Trapani is a smarter where dot org.  Look for a blog post on what Google learned from the buzz and wave launches.  It's at Smarterware dot org.  Very good article.  She's also at Gina Trapani on the Twitter and a beloved friend.  I want to thank you both because I could tell you something.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a great show today, Leah. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We could not do this show without the two journalists with the prestige and stature  of Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis.  You're absolutely critical to this.  Jeff, what a get to get Bradley and Vic on the show.  Huge, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it would be the power hangouts instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, boy, did it.  Yeah, boy. Yeah.  Well, that's that was the joy that Google had on this.  They said the PR people were saying, look, look at the benefit that already came  from hanging out in hangouts.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They got something to they got something to plug, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did.  Hey, one one thing one more thing that we can gush over with in plus just just Leo.  Can you show this? This is really cool.  And this is like one of the most unexpected kind of cool features.  I'm ready.  If you're in plus the gear on the top right hand corner,  you click that it's options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, I got to go back to my plus here.  OK, there's a gear in the upper right hand corner.  I see that options.  Let me zoom in, zoom in a little bit on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Choose send feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Send feedback. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. And now analyzing the page.  Now, what you can do is you can it takes a screenshot of the current page.  You can highlight the problem area and black out private information.  Wow. And then send describe the problem that you're having  and then preview the bug report. Wow.  This is like this sets the standard for so you so go in another area  that's not highlighted so you can black out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, black out. OK. Yeah.  And then redacted, redacted, redacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you describe the problem and then you can preview  and you can see everything that you're sending to Google, the entire screenshot,  your browser details.  This is this is awesome.  Awesome. This is an incredible feedback tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it is great.  Mark Pinkus said that he also wanted a place where he could send just features  because though a bug can be a feature, a feature isn't a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it says feedback. It doesn't say bug.  It says feedback. In fact, my feedback is I love this way too much.  Could you have made it a little bit less useful? Thank you.  I'm never going to get another thing done.  And look at all this additional information, annotations, page information.  This for the engineers. Look at this.  This is all the browser. It's incredible.  This is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is awesome.  This is like this is transparency in showing what am I sending to Google  when I'm reporting a problem,  which when you're reporting a problem about personal, you know, a page  that can include personal information is kind of important.  Anyway, I know that's like it's the nerdiest thing ever.  That's your tip. That's your tip. I love send feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, you had a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I did. What was it? What was it here?  Let's see. As well as well.  It was if we don't feel too sorry for Facebook, 280 percent.  That's how much is advertising revenues up. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And my my tool of the week.  Absolutely get Google plus on your Android phone. It rocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll blow it up.  Mine's been buzzing for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's you know, it's it's fun.  It's a gift in a way to those of us who love technology  to get a new tool to play with that has so much potential.  It's so intriguing.  It has so many nooks and crannies.  And so while I'm sure there's downsides and negatives to this,  and I don't want to sound like a gushing Google fanboy  and I'm sure I do at this point. Here he goes.  I think this is pretty damn cool. Yeah.  Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Gina.  Thank you all for joining us.  We do this show every week live at 1 p.m.  Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern live dot TV on Wednesdays.  Please tune in and join us.  We love having you watch live.  And I think we'll probably will start using Hangout in addition  to our IRC channel to get some interaction.  But we'll probably do that by invitation, because I think  that would be fun is to do a kind of mini Gilmore gang capability  where we have some people that we really want to have as not  maybe a full panelist, but as a part of the conversation.  I think there's all sorts of ways we can use this.  We're just going to start to start playing with this.  If you miss the show, don't worry.  You can get it at twit dot TV slash twig.  T w i t dot TV slash T w i g.  And of course, on iTunes, soon everywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Jeff. One last thing.  I know you all want them. We don't have any invites.  We had to give our 15 before we got in.  So I would love to give you invites.  None of us has any invites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you heard I bet I begged.  I begged. I pleaded.  I asked for invites and you heard me.  You heard me actually be turned down in nice way by even Leo.  So don't ask us. We don't have them.  But, you know, you can go to a plus dot Google dot com.  Is that where you go? I think so.  And you can ask for an invite.  And I bet you that they'll roll this out pretty because you know what?  Correct me if I'm wrong.  You've been using it for much longer than I have, Gina.  I've only been using it for an hour and a half.  It seems pretty stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty stable.  I had I had a few moments where avatars were broken.  Things seemed a little slow.  I got an error message.  But for the most part, it's stable.  I do think that they're dealing with some stability problems.  I hope they roll this out soon, though, because they have an initial wave of enthusiasm from us.  We're not the only ones who are enthusiastic about it.  And I think that they would do well to roll out steadily and quickly, as quickly as possible.  So and over the next few weeks anyway.  So I hope to see that. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Gina. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, everybody, for watching the show.  The autumn leaves of change are blowing through the studio slowly.  Well, I have control.  I can make them blow left, pull right.  I can do it all.  But that means we are out of time.  So say goodbye.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.  Bye bye.
