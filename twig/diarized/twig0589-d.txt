Stacey's got the week off joining us from the Columbia Journalism Review,  their chief digital writer Matthew Ingram. Hello, Matthew. Hey, calling from the great white north.  And it's we got our first snow. Jeff Jarvis got his first snow of the season today in New Jersey.  I asked Matthew and he said, yeah, about 11 day, 11 weeks with how long 11 feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a lot of a lot of winter in Canada. Also, yeah, just getting started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, also with us, the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark School,  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Once again, a 10 out of 10,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  according to Rate My Skype Room, which I won't lord over you too much that you're an eight out of 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get my first rating and it's a lousy eight. You might have overdone it a little bit this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's on the rundown. It's the last thing another. It's very frustrating because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, what we did is we tweeted the moment last week when was it you? We were talking about Rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My Skype Room. Yeah. And I brought up that somebody else had Christmas decorations. Yeah.  Leo never wanted to be outdone. Well, here, watch. This is Room Raider. I love seeing people's bookshelves.  I like seeing the stars that way. Yeah, I do too. And it was Ben Rhodes today. Major points.  He had Christmas decorations at the bookshelf behind. Oh boy. New competition. Oh, yeah.  Should I decorate for Christmas behind me? Oh, yes, Stacey. Yes. Yes. Oh, yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Stacey. Have we talked about Google yet? I feel like we should have some Google stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this. Look at this. There you go. Happy. Decorations complete. And I got a mere eight

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  out of 10 for that. It's just that. For those of you listening, I'm so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shmoe just decked the halls. I'm so infuriated. So. Did that take three seconds? In order to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 out of 10, I have double decked the halls. I think you may have gone overboard now. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I even have a giant white set of bow on my surface studio and bells on the last pass sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need a Santa hat. Oh, well, that could be arranged. I've got one right there.  I got it. Oh, man, I got it all. I got it all. Anyway, happy holidays, everybody. Also with  his aunt Pruitt, the host of Hands On Photography, Hands On Wellness. And he is also just reviewed  on Hands On Technology, a really cool e-bike called the Van Moof. That thing is really,  really, really nice. It's really interesting. Yeah, I love e-bikes. I'm a big fan.  How much? Yeah, that's the problem. Two grand. Yeah, that's so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, hold on. If you look at it compared to some of the other bikes in this class. Oh,  it's cheaper than Specialized. I know. It's like half the price. Specialized. High-end road bikes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are not cheap. Yeah. I have a rad power bike. They're about $1,500, $1,400 or $1,500. And I love  them. E-bikes are great for old people like me. So how does it work? Hold on. Hold on. I got an old

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  guy question. I live in the hills. So I can ride it as a real bike and then when I hit a hill,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it can help me a bit? It's a pedal assist. It's not a moped. More than a bit. So this is the one I  would... I don't know about the Van Moof. That's a little pricey. This is the rad power. I would get...  I have the City. I'm sorry. Well, yeah, you could get the City. I have the City. They have a variety  of these. That's $1,000. It's not as pretty because like the Van Moof, the battery is hidden in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  tube. Yeah, see that looks like an e-bike. The Van Moof does look like an e-bike. It's got a battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I'm not trying to hide it, but I think the performance is excellent. This is great. This  wagon. See this thing on the back? You could put kids on there. You could put a trailer.  It's a haul. You can bring stuff with you. This is the one I have. I really like the Rad City,  actually. It's a great one. So when you hit the hill, what happens? So first of all, the way these  are configured and it really varies by state and by bicycles. And I think this is probably different  from the Van Moof. It's definitely different from the Specialized. This one has a throttle.  So that's legal. The two limits in California, I bet they're the same in New Jersey. You can't go  20 miles an hour and you have to have pedals. But in this case, in California anyway, you can  have a throttle so you don't have to pedal at all. You could just ride it around like a moped.  It only goes up to 20 miles an hour, but it's great. If you're on a flat, you don't need to  pedal. You actually need to pedal on a hill because it's not enough to lift you up the hill,  but you put it in low gear and you pedal. Yes, you don't have to stand up. You don't have to  kill yourself. You'll love it, Jeff. I highly recommend them. But on a flat, I can still  pedal. If you want, you could pedal all you want. You could turn the engine off and pedal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but no, I'm asking something different. I said, what, I'm trying to get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you could still pedal. I want just assistance. There are in this bike five levels of assistance.  So if you have it at one, you're pedaling a lot with a little bit of assist. If you have it at  five, it's assisting and bringing up to 20 miles an hour almost instantly. You throttle, which  doesn't come at all. It's like Ludicrous mode for Texelo when it takes off. And then if you turn it  off, which you can also do, then you're pedaling like it's a regular bike. So even if your battery  died. Yeah, it's a little heavy. It's 60 pounds. Can you get snow tires? You keep asking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would like to have one. Here it is. I recommend it for Canada. Lisa has the fat tire edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so there's a fat tire. I don't know if that's a snow tire. No, I don't, but it's a fat  tire. I don't know if it's a snow. Okay. You know, maybe you can get a snow tire. I don't know. It's  got reflective sidewalls. I don't know. The nice thing is the brake lights and the front light are  powered off the battery, which is really great. So you've got built in lights. I feel very safe in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  these. I'm a big fan. Thank you for that little explanation. Not that I'm going to actually get  one. You should totally get one. I'm still the main rowing machine. No, get this instead of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rowing machine. You'd be so much happier. It gets cold here. No, get a rowing machine as well.  Get them both. Right, get both. You can never have too many exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that I don't use. Things that you don't use. I live in the country now, so I've got an ATV  four by four. Do you really? Nice. So you're living at the cabin now. No exercise though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you living at the cabin now? No, a different. It looks kind of rustic. It's nice. It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to see Matthew on the show, building off the grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love that show. Oh, I do too. We go off the grid all the time. It's my dream. Whether we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to or not. I love building Alaska too. I love it. It's all going to change when Elon gets Starlink  up and running and you'll be able to live anywhere and have good. Yeah, it's fine. I'm up for it.  I've already tried to sign up. That's the one grid I want is the internet.  We have solar, we have well, we have septic. So we're practically there already. I just need

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  internet. So I get 10 megabits. Well, that's not too bad. Is that cellular or phone? I'm actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  using cellular right now because it's faster. Yeah. Well, so you could do this. You can't be  too far off the grid. So there are a number of stories. There's a huge Google story which broke.  We kind of started with it, the Timnit Gebru story. We talked a little bit about it last week.  She is a very well known AI ethicist and scientist. She wrote the original paper that showed that women  of color were often misidentified by face recognition technology. That was a couple of years ago.  Google hired her to be part of their ethical AI team. They fired her  last week after she created the whole team. I think. Oh really? So she was her team.  She had written a research paper with a co-author to research paper with a number of other people  that apparently Google didn't like too much. Among other things, the paper and actually the MIT.  Let me see if I can find this. Technology review. They wrote about it. They didn't put the paper up.  They didn't put the paper up but they summarized the paper and they talked about what Google  probably didn't like about it. One of the things Google said, hey, that stuff about how much the  carbon footprint of AI and training artificial intelligence is that that's old. We've gotten  better than that because I remember Google's really pushing the fact that there's carbon neutral and  all that. In the paper, she said that energy consumption and carbon footprints of machine  learning training AI models have been exploding since 2017 as models have been fed more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  data. That was the most important part of it. I got the impression they were partly upset about  her argument that large data set machine learning, which is exactly what Google does,  the larger the data set, the less you should trust it unless you can basically disclose everything  that the data set does, which obviously they don't want to do. And by the way, that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google hired her is to raise alarms about stuff like that. Theoretically, yeah. Now Google said  we didn't fire her. Sorry? She sent a mean email. She sent a mean email. Google said that they  weren't wouldn't publish the paper because, quote, it didn't meet our bar for publication.  She sent an email that said she would resign unless Google met a number of conditions,  which it was unwilling to meet. She tweeted that she had asked to negotiate a last date for her  employment after she got back from vacation. She was cut off from a corporate email before  she got back. So they were negotiating her departure, but they fired her before the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  negotiation, I guess. Yeah, they said. So Google basically said you were taking your note about  these conditions to mean that if we don't meet them, you will resign. And instead of taking time  for you to resign, we think you need to resign effective immediately because of the email you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sent. Now, I often try to avoid employment disputes because the law, especially in California,  is very strict about what you could talk about as an employer. So we probably don't know what else  went on or anything like that. However, a lot of people at Google, 1200 workers have signed a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  petition condemning the firing. Many other work and Google itself, her boss talked about it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's kind of the game now said he's going to investigate. Yes. And our Pachai today. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  below that, no, the her direct or her direct boss, right. Okay. And today, so in our Pachai  apologized for the company's handling of her departure and said he'd investigate and work to  restore trust. This was a memo he sent internally, but Axios, of course, obtained. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. So, but my problem is we don't know what else happened. So I'm always hesitant to weigh in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  on these things. My initial response was the whole policy about submitting this information. And you  had what was it a two week window to wait for the approval. And I have no problem with standard  operating procedures. But according to these other staff members that that SOP really meant a hill  of beans. It never really mattered. There was a lot of things that just didn't really meet the  requirements of two weeks and didn't really matter at times. Yeah. Casey Newton said that he heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from people at Google that no one submits their papers two weeks before. She was treated differently

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  than normal. Right. I was totally fine when I saw that there was a procedure in place and I said,  okay, well, you're supposed to follow procedure. But if the procedure was bull crap, I get where

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  she's coming from. Yeah. So regardless, I mean, it looks terrible. Yeah, that's what I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. That's what I would say. Not a good look. Even if there were all sorts of other things we  don't know about. It's not a good look. You hire a black woman to run your ethics team and then fire  her because you don't like what her report was. It doesn't look good. Yeah, it just looks terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let us make the diversity higher to look good and have the right optics. That's what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, and we want to look into ethics, the ethics of AI right up until it threatens our use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of AI. Yeah. What is happening over the last few months and this week particularly is that the big  tech companies are, people are kind of turning, there's tides seems to be turning against them.  The other big story this week is that 46 states plus Squam in Washington DC have joined the  Federal Trade Commission in suing Facebook for illegal monopolization. And boy, when you get  46 out of 50 states coming down your throat and Squam. Don't forget Squam. Today, the Federal Trade Commission

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  authorized a complete... Oh, I'm sorry. This auto play, you know, Ian, you got to learn about auto play

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on the website. Squam punches above their weight. Yeah, clearly. I've been reading, I downloaded the  124 page filing and it's very thoughtful, very well written. Obviously in the research for this,  they had a lot of emails. In fact, they had a lot of internal information because some of it's redacted  in the public release. It is a very, I think somewhat damning history of  Facebook's, you know, exactly as they have been accused by others, anti-competitive acquisition  of Instagram and then later WhatsApp. There's smoking guns galore. I mean, there's emails from  Mark Zuckerberg saying, yeah, we want to get them before they get too big and threaten us.  And he even said, and this is exactly what a trust law is supposed to prevent by buying this company.  Not only we take a competitor out, but we gain enough scale and we gain enough technology that  no one else can compete with us down the road. That's exactly, that's like you, it's like you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wrote your own indictment. The only thing, sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. I was just going to say that  all the smoking guns and the, what Facebook said about Instagram and WhatsApp, first they have to  prove that Facebook is a monopoly. So you're, it's not illegal to do, to buy companies or even if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're small competitors. Well, they address that. In fact, they address that even before they talk  about the smoking gun to say that what the space Facebook is in is essentially without competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I don't see how, like that's an arguable point. Is TikTok not competition? Are they ruling it?  Is Twitter not competition? We had the actual story last week that showed everything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every site now has the same features. Yeah. As far as I can understand, they're arguing that Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  its market consists solely of talking to your friends. So then TikTok doesn't apply because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's not you talking to your friends. They call it a personal social networking service. And they  do in fact specifically say why it's not the same as Twitter. It's not the same as messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  applications of any kind. Facebook's lawyers will have a few things to say about that. This is what  Benedict Evans talks about all the time about Facebook, about Amazon and so on is it's all  about definition of market. Matthew is exactly right. You have to start with what the market is  before you can say you're a monopolist in it, before you can then say that you abused your monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not just that though. If you look at Instagram, I mean, I remember when they bought  Instagram and Instagram was fun, but had no revenues of any kind. And I don't know,  did it have a million users even? No, probably not. It was growing very fast.  Even if you'd looked at it, you would have thought this is ridiculous. It's a tiny little  photo sharing thing. Like now it looks because they've connected it to Facebook. But at the time,  it would have been difficult to make the case that it would be anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree, Matthew. So I'll give you a couple of quotes. Early on in the  pleading there is a long section talking about why they consider Facebook to be unique  in personal social networking and that there is no competition. And they say they have something  like 78% of the market. Personal social networking services they write are distinct  from and not reasonably interchangeable with specialized social and social networking services  like those that focus on professional LinkedIn or interest-based Strava connections.  Specialized networks are designed for and used primarily for sharing a narrow and highly  specialized category of content. They're distinct from and not reasonably interchangeable with  online video or audio consumption focused services like YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and Hulu. They  probably wrote this before TikTok was a big player. They say mobile messaging services  do not feature a shared social space in which users can interact. I mean, they clearly know  that they have to prove this and they spend a lot of time. Facebook's lawyers are going to have  much to say. That's what it's going to hint on. They quote Mark Zuckerberg from his 2019 post  calling personal social networking providers like Facebook the digital equivalent of a town square  contrasted with the private communication offering by services like WhatsApp, which are the digital  equivalent of the living room. So even Zuckerberg makes that distinction. Yeah, I'm sure the  Facebook's defense is, oh no, we're part of a much larger internet ecosystem. But I think you can  really make the argument that Facebook has moved at every point to consolidate because of the  network effect which they address because of Facebook's gathering of data, which they describe.  They say Facebook has a substantial competitive advantage with respect to data because of its  ability to align Facebook user identity across the family of apps it has acquired, Instagram,  WhatsApp, and others, and with users off Facebook data, the like button. The volume, velocity,  and variety of Facebook's user data give it an unprecedented, virtually 360 degree view of  the user and her contacts, interests, preferences, and activities, which allows Facebook to personalize  content to its users that other platforms are not able to provide. They also say that they have a  significant advantage in the ability to monetize the service because of networking barriers in  personal social networking services market make putative competitors unlikely to be able to match  Facebook's access to users time and attention, which in turn determines the volume of inventory

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for ads they can sell to advertisers. So it seems to me one question they're going to have to answer  is why then did these acquisitions go ahead? Why did the FTC and antitrust not say something at the  time? Because now it's a little late. You're going back years to reverse an acquisition.  The message that sends to companies that are going to acquire things is at any point in the future,  if you build that thing up to be something great, we can force you to sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's another smoking gun. There was a company, I don't remember this, called Octazen. Octazen was a  connector that would take contact information, format it, and then allow you to suck it up.  In July 2009, Headed of International Growth Javier Olivan learned that Twitter was also  licensing Octazen's services. He emailed two other executives to suggest that as valuable as licensing  was proving to be owning them would be even better. Complete control of Octazen would enable  Facebook to deprive rivals and potential rivals of this important resource. Would it make sense  to try to buy these guys? By doing so, we would keep in-house the expertise of building and  maintaining improved importers and let everyone else in the industry without a provider for contact  importer libraries. So they bought the company. Just like Twitter bought Tweet Tech right off

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  underneath the hands of a friend of mine who had a deal too. I put up the right below the stories  on line 40 something. I put up that Axios chart again which is worth looking at  because it shows how line 42. I see it. I got it. Right? It shows how  by feature it's not a monopoly. Everybody's doing it. Everybody else is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody would say that the experience of Facebook is anything like the experience on any

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of these other ones. Well, it depends on how you use it. If you love stories on Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it's like Snapchat and it's like everybody. There are people that use Pinterest quite heavily  and it's like another messaging and communication platform. Do you go to Pinterest though to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what the grandkids are up to? Some people do. Pardon? Some people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think a stronger part of the case is their arguments about the API. It's not as sexy as the  acquisition part but I think they have a lot more ammunition to say force Facebook to allow more  access to APIs or to be more transparent about the APIs and quit cutting off smaller competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where does that put Twitter? With its API? Yeah, exactly.  There was a lot of fuss and kerfuffle over the Twitter API many years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  regarding things like TweetDeck. They have been opening up more. I think they realized at some  point that that was a mistake. They nuked the entire developer community and it took years to  sort of, I mean there's still developers that I see. Well, what helps kill, not kill this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  complaint, but it has a big impact on it at the exact same time it comes out is the story on line 77.  You there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah. TikTok thinks of Facebook to become the top app worldwide by downloads  but it's not even close in monthly or daily active users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, but the point is this is early days and FriendFeed is going to own everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but that's the point is Facebook put FriendFeed out of business, put Friendster out  of business, put MySpace out of business. There's a whole section on what happened to Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they blaming Facebook for Google+. I mean Google put Google+.  Yeah, but they're also saying that Google+. couldn't compete with Facebook and Facebook was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  worried about Google+. And that was an example of something they couldn't acquire.  Were they? Again, they have a lot of emails.  Calling Mike Elgin.  They have a lot. Were they? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. They have a lot of emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean there's no question, there's no question Facebook is a massive, massive company and it's  got a huge amount of power, especially the algorithm and its ad business. The problem is going to be  proving that that is illegal or that they've done something.  That's why this is going to go on for years. But on the other hand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what I am encouraged by this is this doesn't look like a political  hatchet job by any means. This isn't because Facebook decided to fact check the president's  posts. Anything along that. How do you tell these days?  Your respite, go ahead.  Well, there's a little, you know, there is actually a little bit of that in the complaint,  but this is 46 states. This is not just the red states. This is a lot of people.  I think if I were Facebook, take it pretty seriously, what's interesting is the stock  market doesn't seem to be too worried about it. Facebook, I think was down 2%. Let me just see.  2%. The stock market knows it's going to take years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Nasdaq was down considerably. The Nasdaq was down 2%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Facebook just matched the Nasdaq.  Yeah. Nothing is going to happen.  Prove the Nasdaq.  It was down 1.93% today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  1.94 for the Nasdaq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're too big a chunk of the Nasdaq, clearly.  We're going to be covering this one for a long time. I have to say it's very well written.  There's a lot of establishing emails and quotes. It's not a lot of supposition in here.  We'll watch this with interest.  You know, when you get 46 states and the feds breathing down your neck, that's…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but this is the issue now. It's like the Australian law,  which I'm sure we'll talk about in a few minutes. It's like the French law before.  It's now the suddenly, in media and politics at least, not among users, the unpopular industry.  So you can go after them. They're treating them like cigarettes now, which is ridiculous  because it's an industry that gives us wonderful things. It doesn't kill us.  But it's they're treating it like oil and cigarettes.  We can go get taxes out of them. New York is… There's only a proposal in a state legislator  to tax every delivery you get from online for $3 a box.  It's easy to go after them now. It's the unpopularity tax.  The argument that Benedict Evans made about the Australian has nothing to do with copyright,  nothing to do with freedom of expression. It's all about politicians going after  an allegedly unpopular industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say this indictment of Facebook is nothing like the Australian indictment,  which is clearly driven by a few special interests lobbying the government to act on their behalf.  I don't know if this is such a broad…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you trying to say there's not a political angle at all to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is a reasonable question. I don't think it's political, no.  Clearly Facebook has acted in a predatory fashion.  You might be able to defend it. I think it's going to be a stretch to say Facebook  has competition, but that will be one angle of defense.  It's pretty clearly they acted in a very… Microsoft like predatory fashion,  buying and killing competitors so that they could have this dominant position.  That's pretty clear. That's not political. That's clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so one big thing that we haven't mentioned is that antitrust law for the last several decades  has focused on consumer harm as the most important thing, not anti-competitive behavior,  not how other companies are affected, how consumers…  Well, they make a case for consumer harm in here.  I know. That's going to be the hard part. That's going to be the hard part. You're going to have to…  Because of course you don't pay for it, so you can't say the price is too high,  but they will have to argue that consumers are harmed because of vague things like privacy  or their data being shared. Those are difficult cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're doing voluntarily for a reason to get a free service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. I think they make a pretty strong case for not only consumer harm,  but also advertiser harm.  But nobody cares about that.  Okay. But that's enough fronts that… And I think antitrust law in the United States is evolving.  I think that that was another thing that's happening. It's not necessarily…  It is, yeah.  Yeah. It's not just consumer harm or company harm they're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you have to shift the entire body of antitrust law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The hardest thing is to know what remedies they would be looking for or would be reasonable.  When politics does get into it because… I guess the courts are going to decide this,  but nevertheless I think there might be some Facebook users might be right at various states  attorneys general for going after their beloved Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's say they divest… What if they divest Instagram and WhatsApp and then they start an  Instagram competitor and they start a WhatsApp competitor?  How do we benefit? How does that make things any better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish they hadn't put Path out of business because that was a good competitor.  But that…  It was just a better UI.  It was better in every respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matthew's analysis on this has been trenchant and right. Every level of it, I think,  will come back to his analysis and it's well thought out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Trenchant is good, right? Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trenchant… I don't know. It is good, but it always reminds me of trench foot.  Or trench mouth.  Or trench mouth. So it's good, but it has a bad kind of vibe to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is vigorous or incisive in expression or style and in an archaic sense having a sharp edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. It's the peak quantity of speech or something.  Vigorous and incisive, I think is the operative sense here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put that on your Twitter bio.  And as when it comes to consumer harm…  I just blurbed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When it comes to consumer harm, one of the things they are very much talking about is  how Facebook has been used to bring Nazism into people's homes and things like that.  It's a really interesting…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and the GOP has had nothing to do with that.  Well, it doesn't matter.  GOP trying to kill the American election.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not a good thing, but it's a separate thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, totalitarianism came from a simple social network, not from the White House. Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember, I don't even know if this is…  At this point, I don't think the White House is pursuing this or pushing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the White House? This is Jay Rosen's point often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It will be interesting to see what happens with the Biden administration.  Do they push this?  I think this continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it does. There's also against…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they have old farts there from old industries like media who are against  technology companies. And that's the problem.  People I know who've been trying to advise the Biden team have been trying to bring in  different voices in this. But the problem now is those voices are the a-holes we don't like  from Silicon Valley. So that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's one of the paragraphs.  Users of personal social networking services have suffered and continue to suffer a variety  of harms as a consequence of Facebook's illegal conduct, including degraded quality of users  experience, less choice in personal social networks, suppressed innovation, reduced investment  and potentially competing services. Facebook's conduct deprives users of product improvements  and as a result users have suffered and continue to suffer reductions in the quality  and variety of privacy options and content available to them. By eliminating, suppressing  and deterring the emergence and growth of personal social networking rivals, Facebook also harms  advertisers in a number of ways, including less transparency to assess the value they receive  from advertisements and harm to their brand during…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, they're going to complain that Google is a monopoly in advertising and you can't  have it both ways here, folks. Google is a monopoly in advertising. Oh, but Facebook  is doing huge things in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They quote Sheryl Sandberg saying this is not search advertising, this is social advertising.  They are specifically saying this is a different kind of advertising than what Google does and  they have a monopoly on social advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's PR. The same way as when I'm around Google, Matthew and I are around Google people.  They… If we… If anybody says the platforms, the Google people are all trained like automatons  to say, we're not all platforms, don't put us with them, it's PR. It'll be useful in  their argument, but it's PR. They're competing with each other for advertising, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So if Facebook had not purchased the Instagram and decided to just build their own version of  this, would any of this be a problem and they continue to have just as many users on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  platform? Yeah, but the issue is that they clearly showed in their emails that they purchased  Instagram for anti-competitive reasons. So it's just…  Which was okay at the time. Well…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was fine at the time. Okay.  It was a tiny service. They overpaid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not talking about Comcast and AT&T. I mean, it was a tiny photo sharing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't that tiny. I mean, they're talking in this… Again, I'll pull you back to the court  document. They say how fast Instagram was going instantly and how concerned… And again,  they have the emails. People inside Facebook were at how fast Instagram was going and particularly  because Instagram was mobile first and photos first and Facebook could not compete with that.  I think they're… I think… I don't know. I am… I think this is a very compelling document.  It's a well-constructed case. Is it just a judge that you have to convince or is it…  Would there be… There ultimately may be a jury, right?  I doubt this is going to be a jury trial. You think it'll be judge only?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even think it's going to go to a trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they'll… So Dr. Trenchett,  do you think it's going to be settled or never get there or what's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure Facebook would love to settle this. Either never get there or settle.  Hard to settle with 46 states in the FTC, not to mention Guam.  Not impossible. Those Guamers are really hard to negotiate with.  Yeah. Two of Facebook's largest acquisitions, the mobile social photo app Instagram and the  mobile messaging service WhatsApp, each posed a unique and dire threat to Facebook's monopoly.  Each had enormous and rapidly growing user networks and each was well positioned  to encroach on Facebook's dominant market position. Facebook…  That's ridiculous. Well…  That's ridiculous. Is it ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is ridiculous to say Instagram at the time posed a dire threat to Facebook. I just think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  absurd. Well, they have to make the case, obviously. And I think they believe they've made the case  because they have a lot of documentary support for that, including the opinion of people inside  Instagram and inside Facebook who are very… I think you could actually make a better argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for WhatsApp. I mean, for instance… They paid 19 billion, which was…  100 times what anybody else was paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the time, Facebook… Well, same thing happened with Instagram. Instagram was valued at half a  billion and there's an email from Mark Zuckerberg saying we should pay a billion so they can't say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But WhatsApp, someone offered to pay 100 million and they paid 19 billion.  Right. And it was also…  Is WhatsApp in there?  Oh yeah, WhatsApp's in there.  …just the biggest system in the world. So I think they've got a better case with WhatsApp  than they do with Instagram. Yeah, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would a judge order? What would a judge say would have to… You put an ombudsman in there…  Breaking up makes no sense.  …and you say, you open the API. Yeah, I don't think breaking up at this point…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so what the UK is doing, the UK is starting a new competitive regulator because they love  regulators there. And it's going to be less focused on breaking up and that kind of stuff  because they can't really do it from the UK. But it's going to be setting standards and  accountability and that kind of stuff. So it's going to be watching them like a hawk  on certain criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think if they're… we could all benefit if they actually pushed  transparency and openness and federating with other apps. I mean, we'd be way better off  than just some order that they sell these two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever happened to at Jack's… I forget the name of the project where he was going to…  Still going.  …twitter open source. It's still going. What's the name of that? Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I forget. I think…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that could be a really interesting piece here, right? Where… fine. Jack, meanwhile,  the great party spoiler, says, I'm going to federate Twitter and I'm going to build a value  added business on top of it, just like WordPress. And fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter does not in any way compete with Facebook. Twitter's not even close to Facebook.  I'm not sure that's true.  The people…  Oh, no, I disagree.  Oh, I… you guys are nuts. First of all, nobody uses Twitter except you guys. Nobody uses Twitter  except the media elite.  A few other people do.  A lot of normal people don't use Twitter.  What do you know? You don't use Facebook anymore.  Yeah, for this reason. I don't want to participate in that garbage.  My daughter uses it. She's not on the media.  But they're very… most daughters do not use Twitter. They don't use Facebook either,  probably. Twitter is completely separate. It's about short, hot takes. Facebook is about seeing  what your family and friends are up to, reading the news, joining groups. It's a very different  experience. It's not comparable at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would argue that a Facebook group is not that different from Twitter.  At least some of the Facebook groups I've been in. There's a lot of short, hot takes in there  and a lot of it is trolling. It's not that different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The premise is the whole family and friends connection on Facebook, but you can,  with a little bit of know-how, curate the same type of experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's doing that, Ant. I got bad news for you.  Yeah, that's what I know. The normals are not going to do that.  Nobody's doing that.  I've got all my aunts and uncles on Twitter and we just talk together amongst each other.  Twitter's not of that. It's a very public space.  Facebook is not a public space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to call upon the book by Andre Brock Jr. again that talks about  black Twitter in a way that…  Black Twitter is different.  …is a closed space.  But it is a space of language that's built in the public, but in a sense hidden in the  public in that way. So you can't…  And then there's weird Twitter.  You've got to be careful about how you analyze these things and bring these presumptions.  Book title, just so I give the plug, because it's very good.  Andre Brock Jr. Distributed Blackness African American Cybercultures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think you're right, Leo, but the point is that this…  Thank you, Mr. Trenchant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't tell him that. Jesus. Oh, the Canadian in you cannot help but come out.  Next thing you're going to apologize for disagreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the story of Trenchant and Trenchmouth. It's together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're right in a very limited way.  You're trying to make it up now, Matthew.  The hard part is that all of these things overlap.  You can't draw a discrete boundary around Facebook's market.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the hard part.  No, I agree. But honestly, how many users does Twitter have?  300 million? 400 million?  How many users does Facebook have? Two and a half billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little more than that. But most of them don't really use it, right? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter, I would agree. At least half of those 400 million are bots.  Twitter is not… Twitter's importance has been way overstated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be an interesting antitrust defense?  Oh, actually, three quarters of our audience doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook really tries hard to make sure everybody on Facebook's real, right?  One of the things they did that was their secret sauce.  You don't think they try hard to do that?  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They don't care?  No, they don't care.  And fundamentally, so what matters is engagement.  And as my favorite quote says a former Facebook engineer,  you know what's really engaging? Bullshit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I would disagree with you, Matthew. Clearly, they care about engagement.  But there's no point if a bot is engaged. No one freaking cares.  What they care about is a human being that they can gather data points about while they  are engaged so they can sell to them. That is their absolute business model.  You can't sell to a bot. Bot's not buying.  You can.  Well, this is the response to Ad.  If a bot is well-constructed, it's fundamentally indecisive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's indistinguishable from a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so you still get to charge the advertiser for the bot.  Right.  That's the problem right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bot clicked on your ad, scrolled down, clicked on an image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but advertisers, I mean, okay, maybe our advertisers are smarter than the average bear,  but they're really much more interested in a return on investment than somebody clicked  and scrolled. They want to see how many units they sold. If the bots are buying,  okay, I'll grant you that. But if the bots are clicking without buying,  all that doesn't look bad for Facebook. Then the advertisers come back and say,  oh, we got all these clicks, but we didn't get any sales. That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think that's the business they're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, the business we're in, because I hear that a lot from advertisers.  We sent, I can't remember what it was, 14,000 visitors to one advertiser's website,  and they were unhappy. In fact, they canceled because they didn't sell enough product.  It's like, well, my position is if I sent them to your site and you didn't buy the product,  that's your fault. That's your fault, man. I got them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got them there. What do you want me to do? Take their wallets and take the money out?  You got to sell them once they get there. Anyway, our advertisers are smart, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They care more about sales than they do about clicks and scrolls.  All right, let's take a little break. This is a good conversation. The good news is  we're going to be talking about this for at least 10 more years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are. I'm not.  Are you leaving already? That's it. I'm done, man. I'm done.  I'm done with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know what? I have a PTSD from 1998. We had just started Tech TV,  and the very first story was the DOJ goes after Microsoft. The network was over before the lawsuit  was over. I'm just saying these things do drag on. Our show today, I love this podcast,  Command Line Heroes, and I love the host of Command Line Heroes. She does such a good job.  It's the story of the geeks, the developers, the programmers, the hackers, the open source rebels  who are changing the technology landscape. Season six just came out. Fantastic. Command Line Heroes  tells you about all the stories of black technologists who innovated and invented,  despite systemic racism, unfair hiring practices, and unequal education opportunities. There's a  story about Gladys West, who you may not know, but man, you know her work. Her mathematical models  and data analysis made GPS possible. Mark Dean, raised in the Jim Crow South, grew up to change  the PC industry with the ISA bus. That's just a few of the stories in Command Line Heroes.  I think it's really good, and I think you ought to listen. Check out all the incredible stories  from season six today. Actually, once you're done with season six, there's five seasons before it  that were just as good. With some of the most interesting people in technology, Command Line  Heroes. Search for it anywhere you listen to podcasts. Command Line Heroes, download it today.  Good on you, Saron. Really well done. It's just better and better each season. Command Line Heroes,  everywhere you listen to podcasts, as they say. I only got to page 32. We've got a lot more to go  through. This thing is ridiculous. Oh, no. This thing. I'm getting rid of this. We're going to lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ant if you do that. That thing in front of you made you look like there was a red rabbit trapped.  I'm the one with the poinsettia in my hair. Oh, we lost Ant. He's gone. He met it. He said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not talking about it anymore. All right, let's talk about Australia because there is a change.  There you go. That's a look, isn't it? There's a change in the law. Remember, the law was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they were trying to- It's legislation. It's not a law yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes. It hasn't passed yet. The proposed law was going to charge Google and Facebook for the  snippets from news organizations. You said Jeff was really Rupert Goldberg. What's his name? Rupert  Murdoch. Murdoch. Pure Murdoch. Well, did Murdoch give up? I think that happened. Didn't he kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, not at all. What's happened here is that Google has been screaming  that if we're supposed to negotiate, we're not even allowed to bring up the fact that we bring value  to the publishers by sending them value in the form of people.  Which is clearly true.  That's a small concession. It's absolutely true and it's greater value. Before we know here,  Murdoch is going to end up paying Google. But that aside, Facebook, on the other hand,  it thinks that Google is being quizzling here and is saying, if this thing passes in any form,  there's no news on Facebook. So Google and Facebook are operating at different levels on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, and apparently Australian legislators are bending a little bit, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's interesting. Google used to be the one that threatened to pull out of countries,  you know, if they did something wrong.  That's Facebook, yeah.  Now it's hand in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they both, they both, I've heard them, I've heard them, you know,  like threaten to pull out of Europe. So they've both been like that. That's just,  they just do it at different times in different ways.  Should we?  Put it on the right and checks.  Should we?  No, which is dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Should we watch the year in search 2020? I always enjoy these. You want to watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The view of the stories about it was that it was very 2020. If you go to the left, top left,  the top news things go to all 10. They're all depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to watch the video.  All right.  All right. Yeah. A lot of coronavirus.  It was a depressing year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even, even if Tom Hanks was the number one searches because he got coronavirus.  So coronavirus election results, Kobe Bryant, the number three search.  This has been such a long year. God, that was this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Zoom.  Right. Seems like it was a little longer day.  Yeah.  That's a positive story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zoom.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, most of the searches were-  A negative story is a negative story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most of the zoom searches were, how do I use this? Why am I muted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't we love zoom? Don't we love all being on zoom all day long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do, but we only love it because we're all dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's IPL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Indian Premier League perhaps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's soccer. You're right.  I mean-  Cricket.  Yeah, you're right. Cricket.  There you go. India versus the zoom.  Yeah, it's cricket. Then more coronavirus.  Coronavirus.  Way down there, Joe Biden.  Nobody's searching for Joe Biden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do I use Google Classroom?  I've got to teach all these brats. How do I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In news, coronavirus, election results, Iran, Beirut, and Hunter virus. Wow.  Okay.  In concerts, together at home concert.  Firefight Australia concert.  Garth Brooks Drive.  I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that fire is all over Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's not forget.  Movies, Parasite, 1917, Black Panther.  Those are all from earlier in the year, the Oscar winners, because-  When we had movies.  We had no movies.  I like it though that the 2008 movie or 2005 movie Contagion is not in the top five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was in one month. That was the number one movie-  Oh yeah, on iTunes.  ... over the last like two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched it.  Yeah, I did too.  Yeah, it's how we learned what Arnaut was.  Great movie.  Yeah. Ricky Gervais in the top five actors.  Ryan Newman, the number one athlete. Michael Jordan.  Concerts, so we did that one.  TV shows, Tiger King, then Big Brother Brazil.  Lyrics-  You want to watch the video? Go ahead and watch the video.  WAP, of course.  Of what?  WAP, of course.  WAP. You want to watch the WAP video?  That is the worst video. Oh my God.  That's basically porn.  I mean, the whole song is porn.  So I have-  What's your porn?  I was listening. I don't remember where this was.  Maybe it was at Dear Abby.  Yeah, I think it was on Salon.  A mom said, so my daughter, my 11-year-old daughter said,  what's WAP, mama?  And she went, and then said,  my friend's mom says it's waffles and pancakes.  Nice. Good one.  But my other friend's mother says it's worship and praise.  Wow.  The mother said, I had to explain it, what it really was with my bad mom.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm the only person who doesn't know anything about it.  You don't know about WAP?  I remember seeing the hashtag and all of that stuff, but I refused to click.  You better off.  You should check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know until just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just looked it up, didn't you?  What?  Yeah.  Cardi B, baby.  You guys are so old.  You know how I know what it is?  Oldish.  I got my new speakers and I thought, oh, I want to listen to this new stereo.  So I just pulled up Apple Music and played a song at random and Lisa comes running in.  She says, that's my favorite song.  And then I'm starting to listen to the lyrics because I don't usually listen to lyrics.  And my jaw is going.  So I don't know if this is good or bad to be in the top five people search.  Number one, Joe Biden.  Number two, Kim Jong-un.  Number three, Boris Johnson.  Number four, Kamala Harris.  Number five, Tom Hanks.  I don't know.  Would you want to be on that list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm looking at the recipes.  What is ECMEC?  Does anybody know?  Let's look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to find out if it has anything to do with WAP.  I don't want it.  It's a Greek custard and whipped cream dessert.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That looks amazing.  Looks like tiramisu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  Why do you think that that suddenly showed up on the search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because people were making it, I guess.  I mean, sourdough.  Everybody was making sourdough.  You'd expect sourdough to be number one.  First month or two, like everybody and their dog was making sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then this was a big, this silly Dalgana coffee.  Oh, yeah.  That's disgusting.  And it became.  Yeah, I remember that.  It started.  This was TikTok, by the way.  This is a TikTok trend.  You whip up some instant coffee, sugar, lots of it, and water.  And well, she's going to show us how because this is clearly the Dalgana coffee queen.  This is not a TikTok.  It's taken forever.  Two tablespoons granulated sugar, two tablespoons instant coffee, two tablespoons cold water.  You use a hand mixer.  You whisk vigorously.  Actually, it's probably easier with a bullet or one of those handheld mixers.  And you get it really frothed up.  And apparently it tastes kind of like caramel.  Sounds great.  Yeah, it looks kind of good.  And then you put it on.  There's some ice.  There's some milk.  So it's iced coffee.  It's iced coffee, basically.  And you put this.  Wow, look at that.  Look at that.  It's a Christmas miracle.  And then you put some sprinkles on it.  No, you just.  Now I want to make it.  Now I want to make it.  No, I'll pass.  It's a diabetic's dream right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Ant has higher taste than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just slightly, though.  Just slightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then sourdough bread.  We're all over sourdough, right?  Everybody by now has stopped making sourdough.  Pizza, which is a...  And Lamekin?  What's that?  Oh, you want to know them all, don't you?  Lamekin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I know what pizza is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, do I.  It's a Turkish recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Lamekin comes from the Arabic.  Oh, Turkish pizza.  Lachma Bahiyin, dough with meat.  Think of it as a thin, crispier pizza or flatbread  topped with a spiced, minced meat mixture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because as you know, pizza is actually Greek, right?  You know that.  Pizza's Greek?  Yeah.  Comes from Naples.  Naples was originally Greek.  There's actually ancient Greek paintings or mosaics or something  and they're basically eating pizza in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I learned that on the documentary I was talking about  a couple of weeks ago where they mentioned Kachuapepe.  There's another episode talking about Naples and Napoli or whatever.  What's beer bread?  Is it Neapolitan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's bread with beer.  I think every culture has a couple of things.  A dumpling or ravioli or something.  Yes, truffle meat thing.  And a flatbread.  I think every culture has a flatbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, almost every culture has meat on a stick of some kind  and fried dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have corn dogs.  So you're right.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wanted to open a restaurant chain  that was just going to be called Stuffed Meat Things.  Oh, love that.  Right?  Parogies, dumplings, gyoza.  I'd be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me know when you need a sampler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody to come taste your meat pockets.  So you were in vane against the election ad ban on Google and Facebook  and you made an excellent point that this disadvantaged  up-and-coming young poorly financed candidates,  not the big boys, because they could buy TV ad time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it pushed more money from big money to big TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Well, Google has decided to lift the ban as of tomorrow.  Just in time.  There is still, believe it or not,  it seemed like this was the endless campaign season.  It's still going on.  Of course, there's two Senate seats up for grabs in Georgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the fate of the nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  So I guess that's who would be buying these ads.  Who else would be buying them?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  However well-funded you are, and I think all the candidates  in those two races are pretty well-funded at this point,  still that's one way to reach people is with Google.  And I honestly think Facebook should do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With my trenchant analysis, convinced you,  because you were on the opposite side of first,  then you came out on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did convince me.  You know what?  I have to say for all of the ink that was spilled  over the election and all the things that could go wrong  and Russian interference and all the things  that we were worried about,  it actually went really surprisingly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That part went fine.  It's the stuff after the election that's going.  Everybody trying to take a perfect collection  and throw it out.  That's what the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that ironic?  There are those who say, oh, it's you liberals now,  you think it's a perfect election because you won.  I guess you could say that,  but there doesn't seem to be any evidence  as hard as we're looking of fraud.  And in fact, I think one of the things that happened  was the lessons learned from 2016.  And most importantly, all the election,  the technologists who said,  voting machines without a paper trail are too dangerous.  You got to have a paper trail.  And I think many of the states took that to heart  and there was a paper trail.  And these audits that we're seeing in the recounts,  those are based on the paper trail.  And I think that that is showing that that's really the case.  That's how you avoid fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When everybody was screaming about voting machines,  I was saying, oh, come on, it's fine.  And they were right.  They were absolutely right.  Without a paper trail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The lady who was testifying.  The drunk?  The pretty Giuliani.  The woman you regret starting a conversation with  without a hearing.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that the Saturday Night Live take on it?  Sounds like it was.  Yeah, yeah.  It was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it just went on as long as she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one problem with SNL, isn't it?  They don't know how to end a skit.  One of several.  So you wrote an article, Matthew,  in CJR, the Columbia Journalism Review.  Well, you've written many,  but this one is on Facebook's first hearings  on this, you call it the Supreme Court.  There's a couple of problems.  Yes, there's the Oversight Board.  There's a couple of problems.  One is I didn't realize this.  It's going to take 90 days for any opinion  to take effect.  At least, yeah.  So it doesn't really solve any immediate problems,  I guess is what I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you've put your finger on one of the big problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked about the board.  Jeff, I think you agree.  It was a prestigious group of people.  Well-chosen people,  including the former Prime Minister of Denmark.  So here are the cases which you enumerate.  We should do a little game.  We could have a panel.  We could have judges,  and you could be the oversight board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what Facebook did rolling up to the Oversight Board.  They would bring in 40 people in a room  and show them cases and say,  what would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because there are something like 20,000 appeals,  and they only can review six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  20,000, and that was in a number of weeks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So obviously, this is going to be a little bit of a bottleneck.  A screenshot of tweets by former Malaysian Prime Minister  in which he wrote,  Muslims have a right to be angry  and kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past.  Was this left up or taken down?  This was left up, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it was taken down.  So the only thing the Oversight Board is allowed to do  is look at cases where things were taken down.  Oh, you can't look at things.  That they shouldn't have been.  Oh, all right.  It's not allowed to look at things that are left up.  But they're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just figuring out how to do that.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because if you think about it, Leo,  if something's left up,  there's an aggrieved party, which was the poster,  and my post was taken down, so that's the appellant.  Ah.  If something's left up, there's nobody aggrieved.  It could be just, Leo doesn't like the post.  Right.  So it's more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's one I wouldn't like.  Photos of a dead child with text in Burmese saying,  why is there no retaliation against China  for its treatment of Uighur Muslims?  It's the image, I presume, not the content that  caused it to be taken down.  And I think that's kind of-  I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion  about newsworthiness with that.  Next.  Next one is better.  Alleged historical photos of churches  in Baku, Azerbaijan, with text saying that Baku  had been built by Armenians and asking where the churches had gone.  This is the Armenian massacre, I presume,  is the topic of this one.  And the Turks have been pretty-  to even to this day, they really pretty much  don't want to talk about it, do they?  No.  So this was taken down why?  They're historical photos of churches.  Why would you take that down?  It's a good question.  Explain to me.  Eight photographs on Instagram, which include  female breasts and nipples with text in Portuguese  about breast cancer symptoms.  So it was a public health message.  This is a classic case.  There's always been a bugaboo at Facebook.  Always, but they don't like nipples.  They like male nipples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's-  so they like certain nipples in certain ways.  For certain reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You now have to have a child attached to the nipple  or you have to have literally a mastectomy  or be a sculpture, I think.  Those are the three exceptions that have been allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But this is a great example of how it's like saying  I know what pornography is when I see it.  There is no way to define a policy that is not going to  make mistakes and take things down when someone  is writing about breast cancer and posting a photo.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, I can go on.  You can see-  Also known as slippery slope.  First of all, I would say in most cases, these  I mean, they're all legitimate points of debate.  Oh, the churches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The user stated that they are against  Azerbaijani aggression and vandalism.  So it violated the hate speech policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, yeah.  I mean, I think these are reasonable,  but there's only six of them.  This seems like just a drop in the bucket less even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're so kind of obscure.  Not to other cases, but in America?  They're fairly obscure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The breast one, I think, you know,  that's been an issue for a long time in Facebook.  Maybe that should be resolved once and for all.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I don't think it ever can be.  That's sort of my point.  Right.  I'm sure they will talk about this and say many smart things  about it and then we'll just go on with our lives  because there's no way to come up with a coherent,  certainly not a policy that AI could implement, I don't think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a challenge.  I think, you know, if you don't like Facebook,  you could argue this is exactly what they were hoping it would be,  attracting a bunch of attention, doing nothing important.  Right.  Just taking some of the heat off of, you know,  like, go ahead, go off and do that and let us go on with our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that was one of the sort of arguments  when they were putting it together was  find a lot of smart people who are well-meaning  and let them sit in a room and talk about stuff  that has nothing to do with anything.  And then we can point to it and say, look, we're doing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I've written about this where I've argued that  and I've talked to people inside Facebook that  my argument with Facebook is that they don't have a North Star.  When asked, one of the sessions on the oversight board,  the head of the oversight board, so I asked him, I said,  what are you appealing to besides the statutes,  which are community standards of Facebook?  Human rights standards.  Well, between those two, there's a huge gulf  that somehow needs to be filled with something.  And Facebook hasn't really said, this is why we exist.  This is what matters to Facebook.  This is what we expect of you.  This is what you expect of us.  There's none of that that's going to inform this process.  So what I said to the people of Facebook,  and again, I've written this out loud,  was, you know, I think that  I was expecting an American-style constitution,  which is all written down, and here it is, black and white,  versus a common law constitution in Matthewsland  and the United Kingdom and such,  where it's built over time by precedent.  I think there's a possibility here  that a constitution for Facebook  could be built by the oversight board if they pick cases  that illuminate principles rather than statutes.  These six cases, I don't think do that,  but it's a dry run.  The sixth case itself, Leo, is interesting  because it was the one that was referred by Facebook  rather than by a user,  and it involves COVID and hydroxychloroquine,  you know, whose favorite drug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A video about France's refusal to authorize  hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as treatments for COVID-19.  What this description is missing is,  was it advocating it?  Was it complaining about it?  What was the video's message?  Was it pro-hydroxychloroquine?  In which case Facebook taking it down would be,  well, in the interest of public health,  there's no evidence that hydroxychloroquine  is good for anything, so this is promoting...  It was usually moved out of the policy  for violence and incitement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so I guess we're going to have to watch the video

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to understand, maybe it was saying,  burn down all the hospitals  because they won't use hydroxychloroquine.  I think to Jeff's point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  one of the problems is that Facebook does have a North Star,  and the principle is that connecting people is good.  Connecting people is good, if so facto.  Right.  But that's insufficient.  They've always said that.  I totally agree.  That's always what Mark said, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as you connect people, there will be...  The arc of justice will...  Right.  So we will connect vicious Buddhist monks with,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know, with potluck.  You know, with populations in Myanmar  that they want to get rid of,  and boom, we're connecting people.  Yeah.  Job done.  It's connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Good article.  I recommend it.  CJR.  It should be fascinating to watch this thing.  Is it Trenchant?  I think Matthew's Trenchant analysis is right again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Trenchant.  It's obscure, and that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's doing its job.  WhatsApp is pissed.  They're pissed at Apple.  Because Apple, how dare they, says,  you know, if you're going to be an app on the iOS platform,  you have to let people know what your privacy policy is.  And Apple's actually got this new...  They call it a privacy label that will be visible in the app store  that describes...  Their intent is to describe, just like nutrition labels,  in a clear and easily understood way, what an app is doing.  What data it uses to track you, what data it links to you,  what data is not linked to you.  WhatsApp says, well, besides the fact they don't want to do it,  that they're mad that Apple's not doing it for their own messaging app,  which I would be angry too.  Ooh.  Okay, fair enough.  Except that Apple said, no, we are going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is our walled garden, and these are our rules.  Our rules won't apply to us.  They apply to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a good point that I think sometimes the apps  that come with the iPhone, the apps Apple makes,  have advantages that other apps do not.  But Apple responded, and maybe they hadn't planned to,  but once they got the attention from this, Apple said,  oh, no, no, we're going to have that privacy label for our apps as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I don't know, Facebook went away and said, okay, well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never mind.  Never mind, okay.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a good thing, and I understand advertisers don't like it either,  and there's a lot of people who don't like it, but I think it's a good thing.  And honestly, Facebook, if you want to avoid the scrutiny of 46 states and Guam,  it would probably be a good idea if you kind of embraced some of these pro-privacy things.  It's not going to hurt you.  You've got to understand this.  It's not going to hurt you.  People will still do it even if they see it in writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to say, nutrition labels, how many people stop eating things  because the nutrition label says that.  They're making that weird sugar coffee.  They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at it from a regular person's standpoint.  You remember when hip-hop albums started getting the parental advisory label on it?  They sold more.  They sold more, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Tipper Gore, remember?  She wanted parental advisories because the music is rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Trump-chose with brains on Twitter spread more.  The regular consumer looking at that app in the app store, they will not even see the badge.  Because they hear about someone using the app because that's the nice hip thing to do  and they're going to run and install it, period.  And you made it now for things that they shouldn't be installing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's this label going to do?  Jeff made a good point.  The warnings on the president's tweets just increased the readership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Ant.  I didn't hear you speaking.  I didn't mean to talk over you.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you're good.  It's technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People understand that if we were all in the same room, that wouldn't happen,  but because of the technology we use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the health information on a Twinkie.  They sell 800 million of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And yeah, don't you take those Twinkies away.  They're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a Twinkie a long time ago.  I just had a Twinkie the other day.  It has a nice little lemony flavor in there.  Probably isn't vanilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they get away with it because it's not actually food.  There's no food products in there.  Why did you have a Twinkie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What made you have a Twinkie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was one in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's usually how I get them because I don't buy them,  but they tend to show up here in the calendar somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there was one in the house.  I saw it.  Flying Twinkies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was just one.  It was a box.  Box of Twinkies.  I thought, you know, I haven't had one of those.  Maybe I never had one of those.  It's like Popeye's Chicken Sandwich.  Did you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did we end up with a box of Twinkies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I know why there's a box of Twinkies.  We've got an 18-year-old in the house.  Why else would there be a box?  Same reason they're in Aunt's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly why.  Nailed it.  I didn't buy it.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you ate one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I happened to be walking by as I was grabbing my coffee.  He stuck it right next to the coffee stand.  So it's, hey.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was quite delicious.  It's a cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty soon Twinkie Truck is backing up to Aunt's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a little bit of sponge cake with some unknown cream inside.  Sure it is.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We had something, the Half-Loon Moon that we used to eat when we were kids.  And the Joe's Louie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's Twinkie the Kid.  Look at that.  Twinkie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The managing editor I used when I was a TV critic at People, now not TV Guide.  When I wanted to disparage a show, I often called them Twinkie until the managing editor  called me on it and said I had used the word Twinkie as an adjective too often  and I was forbidden to use it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would hope he would say that almost immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I used to call things that were badly made Mickey Mouse.  That was something that people said and we got a letter from Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Disney said cease and desist.  Wait a minute.  What are you implying Mr. Ingram?  Hostess Twinkie flavored coffee.  You get ding-dongs, snowballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shark jumped.  Aunt, Aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could you blend it?  You wouldn't do that Aunt.  No, no, it's the pods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put it in your Twinkies.  No.  Put it in your Durango coffee.  Your Delgana coffee.  Oh, now you're crossing the streams.  Okay, when we get to this point in the show, usually Stacey Conway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Segregation is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep the Twinkie and the coffee separate but equal.  It's okay.  I don't know.  I want to take a little break, come back.  We still have a change log to do.  There's lots more to talk about.  Matthew Ingram is here.  He's the Chief Digital Writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.  That's a pretty prestigious title.  Matthew I on the Twitter.  1T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a Chief Print Writer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't believe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sounds like maybe they made up that title for you, Matt.  Is that?  I mean all titles are made up in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a little on a tight.  They are.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use a typewriter, damn it.  What?  Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who is a digital native by these days, former TV guy critic,  and People Magazine, and Twinkie user.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can accuse me of many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have my cacio e pepe out of the microwave but I don't eat Twinkies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a cacio e pepe and a Twinkie probably nutritionally not so different.  Not at all.  Ant's the guy.  He's the hands on wellness.  Our coach here for photography and wellness, twit.tv slash hop and how.  Our show today brought to you by Bandwidth.  This is actually a Google story in a way because if you use Google Voice,  if you do calling with Google apps, you're using Bandwidth.  They're what's called a CLEC.  That's what they are.  They're a competitive local carrier.  But they are a cloud native, cloud first carrier, and that's what makes them so different.  Really interesting company.  Google uses them.  Lots of companies use them.  Microsoft, Zoom uses Bandwidth.  LogMeIn uses Bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am so excited.  Tomorrow, the biggest game of the year, perhaps of the decade, maybe even of the century,  comes out.  It's called Cyberpunk 2077 and it's going to really be the test of Google Stadia.  Stadia is the Google streaming gaming platform.  Works with pretty much everything.  In fact, one of the things for me that's interesting, I'm going to try playing  Cyberpunk on my new Mac laptop, an M1 laptop.  Google released a native version of Chrome, so I should be able to do it.  If you've got a Chromecast Ultra, you could play it on your Chromebook.  They've got a lot of AAA titles.  And finally, when they showed Stadia, it's more than a year ago now, they mentioned that one  of the things you could do as a player is live stream your games directly to YouTube.  And it all starts tomorrow.  I wonder why.  I wonder why it's rolling out to everybody.  Somebody told me, I think I can play Cyberpunk right now.  Right now.  It came out about 25 minutes ago.  So, and people are already playing it.  Should we see if people are playing it on YouTube?  That's actually kind of cool.  Let me see real quickly.  I didn't, this is spontaneous.  See if people are already playing.  Official gameplay trailer cinematic.  People first impressions.  I want to see something.  Let's, let's see something.  Let's use that special Google tool that says in the past hour.  Here we go.  This is.  Yep, they're already streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.  Welcome to Cyberpunk 2070.  Do you see the lights?  Come on.  As I said, that they're supposed to be cool.  I don't know if it was cool.  Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, enough of that.  So this is interesting because as you know, Twitch is the premier streaming gaming platform.  Microsoft attempted to go after Twitch with its own service called Mixer, which quickly  got put out of business.  YouTube says, hold my beer.  Hold my beer.  And with the top game of the year, it's available on Xbox is available on PlayStation.  But the fact that people could stream it right to YouTube, that's going to be interesting.  They also launched live stream HDR support, high dynamic range.  And that's pretty exciting.  Allowing creators to upload videos with more contrast, more shadows and highlights,  a wider range of colors improved.  And have you tried?  Have you played with this at all?  Doing HDR on YouTube live?  I don't know what you'd have to use their encoder, I think.  Oh, your audio.  It's my, it's my, our fault.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you hear me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hear you.  It was Ant.  Oh, okay.  It wasn't Ant.  It was us.  We turned Ant down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Ant back?  No, he's not back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got the bits all up in a whopper jaw thing and I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matthew, can you talk to, are you okay?  I'm talking now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not on the new thing.  No, it's not that.  I didn't get the new, the new hotbed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you're bitter, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's something else.  Google ads, Apple music support.  Finally to Google Assistant and smart speakers.  I didn't, I mean, okay.  There you go.  Okay, sure.  Well, sure, sure.  That's big.  That's big.  Samsung and I know Stacy would have something to talk about with this.  Samsung has a hub called SmartThings.  It will now work with your Nest devices.  Well, not now, but soon next month.  Yeah, interesting.  Interesting.  I don't know.  It's good when things work with other things.  Things should work with other things.  Right?  Yeah.  This is a big story and I'm not sure, I think we'll hear more about this.  We talk a lot about something called Fuchsia, which is this kind of secret project Google  been creating a new open source operating system.  Not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not so secret, right?  It's out in the open.  We just don't know what they're going to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not anymore.  They just opened it up.  So traditionally when you're doing an open source project, you do it in the open.  You let people contribute, let people play with it, you let people see.  They say, we've been developing Fuchsia in the open in our Git repository for the last  four years.  You've been able to browse that repository.  But today we're expanding the open source model to make it easier for the public to  engage with the project.  We've created new public mailing lists for project discussions.  They have a governance model to clarify how strategic decisions are made.  They're in effect making it a more traditional open source project.  They've got an issue tracker.  And you can now submit to become a committer or a patcher so you can participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So perhaps AMP should have been that earlier on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is an operating system.  It's pretty hard to do an operating system all internally by yourself.  I think this is smart.  Fuchsia is not ready, according to Google's open source blog, for general product development  or as a development target.  But you can clone, compile, and contribute to it.  It has support for a limited set of x64-based hardware.  You can also test it with the emulator.  You can even download and build the source code.  So I guess we'll learn more about what Fuchsia really is.  Android's based on the Linux kernel.  Fuchsia has its own kernel.  But I have to think it has something to do with maybe replacing Android at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which has been the guess.  Do you have any idea what Fuchsia would enable?  Can you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No idea.  No idea.  Let's look at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think animated GIFs run natively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to replace Adobe Flash, which comes to an end.  In fact, Apple today pushed out the last update to Adobe Flash for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The tiniest file in play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fuchsia project values transparency with our community, blah, blah, blah.  Fuchsia interface definition language.  I'm going to have to really look at this more closely to try to understand what it's doing.  Is it a general purpose operating system?  That's the impression I get.  Why?  What is it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So instead of blending Chrome OS and Android,  which a lot of people thought they were going to do,  they're just inventing something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there are reasons.  That Oracle case with the Android API, the Java API,  Supreme Court is in the hands of the Supreme Court now.  That could be a reason to promote Fuchsia.  There are probably other reasons.  Google is going to change...  We were just talking about Apple's privacy.  Google is going to do something similar with Chrome extensions.  They're going to change how they access data next year.  The point will be to make it more privacy-forward.  Next year, Google users will be able to determine which websites an extension can  access when they browse the web.  So it won't follow you everywhere.  Once you grant an extension permission to access a website's data,  that preference can be saved for that domain.  Generally now, when you install extensions, they see everywhere you go.  So more granular privacy controls on Google extensions.  Hey, there's Ant Pruitt.  There he is.  I remember you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hear his voice.  Don't call it a comeback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the Google changelog.  We have so many other things here.  The TikTok ban.  Just an update.  A second...  What a joke.  That's still in the news.  That's still in the news.  TikTok was supposed to be shut down on Friday.  The federal government, CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US,  and the president decided to give them a little more time to negotiate.  At the same time, already one judge had ruled that you couldn't shut down TikTok.  Now a second judge on Monday...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First ruling was based on the First Amendment, which I quite like.  This was a different basis, but two of them said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Judge Carl Nichols of the US District Court in Washington  said that the president overstepped his authority.  He used his emergency economic powers to try to put TikTok out of business.  Increasingly.  I mean, I don't even know if the administration is still going for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This whole thing was a farce.  Let's face it.  It was a...  The whole thing was.  And that's what I meant when I was...  There's no justification for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I was saying, this Facebook thing is at least a coherent, rational thing.  But the TikTok thing wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the TikTok thing, that's like saying, like the TikTok thing,  four-year-old could come up with a better case than...  Like it's not...  That's a pretty low bar to clear.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, you know, one of the things was, well, it's owned by a Chinese company,  and people were saying, well, that could be xenophobic.  There's no evidence that TikTok is doing anything nefarious.  But remember, the same complaint was against Huawei.  And we said, we can't use any Huawei stuff.  And more and more, we're seeing Huawei do some things that are pretty reprehensible.  According to the Washington Post, Huawei tested AI software  that could recognize a Uighur, a Uighur Muslim, and alert police.  The face scanning software could trigger a Uighur alarm.  That clearly is something the Chinese regime wanted.  So, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I mean, if TikTok had any technology like that, I would be 100% behind banning them.  Right.  It was just a sheer political move, and then Trump said, you know,  pay us a bunch of money when you sell it.  It was just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One more chapter in the most bizarre four years in American political history.  It's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like if there was a train wreck and every train car was a dumpster fire.  That was another trenchant analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was trenchant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know the name Josh Richards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're on TikTok, you might.  He's apparently, according to Axios, a TikTok megastar.  He's 18 years old.  Not just a star, a mega star.  22 million followers.  18 years old.  18 years old.  He has joined an early stage venture capital firm as a partner.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so 2020.  Josh has the deal flow, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the kids know.  They do invest in startups that cater to his generation.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  18 year old VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He rose to fame.  Culture of VCs, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a member of Sway House, one of the prominent TikTok creator collabs headquartered in a  mansion in Bel Air.  Richards and fellow Sway House TikTok stars.  Oh, Bryce Hall.  Love Bryce.  Griffin Johnson.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they're the great...  The griff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The griff.  We're so old.  We're so effing old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need to go to college to be a TikTok mega star.  What are you in ACC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who are these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am also a TikTok mega star.  Are you living in a collab house in Ottawa?  You did say you just moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's top secret, though.  Don't talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing, though, if you're a Gen Z-er, you should not do...  TikTok really speaks particularly to 18 to 24 year olds.  One thing you should not do is be taking your financial information from TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I take my health advice from TikTok.  Why shouldn't I take my financial advice from TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this story from Bloomberg Wealth tells the story of one Tommy Zippler with 1.6 million  followers on TikTok.  He posted a life hack last month saying, here's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right there.  Here's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll let him speak for himself.  Here's the Zippler, as we call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you do is get like 20 credit cards that have all different due dates.  Then you max the first one out and then you pay for it with the other one and then the other one  and then you pay for that one with the other one and then the other one.  And you just keep repeating the cycle and you live off credit for the rest of your life.  It's simple.  It's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said, I know it's not possible but I also knew that people would fall for it and think it would actually work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's how bananas are made.  Social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to know how bananas are made?  It involves a scalpel.  It's a little baby banana.  It's a C-section.  Here's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you open up the banana from the top or the bottom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a top guy but I understand it's better to open it from the bottom.  What?  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Monkeys open up from the bottom.  Monkeys know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just take your fingernail off.  You squeeze it and that's it.  Easy peasy.  Ant, are you a top or a bottom guy?  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're talking about bananas.  Puddin'.  Is it going into a pudding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should have come over the other day.  We had a banana puddin' pie.  You would have liked.  I need that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I need that right now.  I will say this though.  As ridiculous as those videos are,  still a credit to these people for being able to put something within this short time.  I know. It's only a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of them are amazing.  I love TikTok.  Do not take investment advice from TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Importantly, a follow up to last week's story.  In line 181.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate it when you do these line things.  You said two weeks ago you liked the lines.  I liked it a little bit Mr. Twinkie.  We're not doing that again.  Ratatouille.  The TikTok.  You're just doing this to make Ant crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to get a performance.  Wait a minute. Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do we get that?  It's the top. It's the headline.  Ratatouille. The TikTok musical streaming concert.  It's for a good cause.  To benefit the actors fund.  These poor Broadway actors  or any actor or any performer  musicians too.  There's no venues.  Just feel for these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ant, I'll pay for your ticket  to watch Ratatouille the musical.  I will turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not going to say I'll watch.  Where can we watch it?  I'll turn it on.  I want to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will stream on TodayTix.  T-I-X.  January 1st 7pm.  You know what? I'm going to do it.  There was a stream  of a reenactment  of the Princess Bride.  They got all the characters together  to benefit the Wisconsin Democrats.  I heard about that.  It was so much fun to see them all over.  Did you see the Dazed and Confused one?  I did not. I loved that.  It was Spicoli.  Dazed and Confused was a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I loved that movie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was Shia LaBeouf.  That's right.  Beef.  It's worth watching.  He really goes for it.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever heard  of revenge bedtime  procrastination?  Yes. Big fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently...  I thought you meant the band.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are number two  and are tragically hip  in the Canadian charts.  Revenge bedtime procrastination.  Apparently,  it's a problem  with Chinese workers  who are working so long,  9 hours a day,  6 days a week,  rather 9 to 9, 12 hours a day,  6 days a week,  that they are staying up late.  There is even a name for it.  Bao Fu Xing A Yue,  A O Ye,  Revenge bedtime procrastination.  It literally stands for  retaliation.  To reassert control over their lives.  I understand that.  If you have ever worked a 12 hour day,  you want to get up and go back to work again.  You want to have a little time to yourself.  So apparently it's a big issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why I put that.  The old joke with Disney was,  if you don't work on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a good joke.  Wow. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see.  What else?  We've been talking all week about HBO Max  and HBO and Time Warner  and what AT&T is doing.  They are actually saying,  and this is AT&T owns Warner Brothers.  Remember during the whole,  it took them two years to get the acquisition  through the government.  And John Stanky  and the AT&T executives kept saying,  look, nothing is going to change.  You know, we're just,  there's synergy.  Well, things are changing.  They announced, with very little  warning to the movie theaters,  that all of their movies for next year,  starting this year with Gal Gadot's  Wonder Woman 1984,  but all of their movies for next year,  will stream for free  on HBO Max.  You have to pay for HBO Max, but will stream  once you pay for it for free.  It's included.  At the same time as they released to theatrical release.  It's pretty big.  It'll be for four months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sell your popcorn futures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AMC CEO was kind of devastated.  So were some creators.  Christopher Nolan,  who created Tenet  and Inception and a few  Batman movies.  He said, some of our industry's biggest filmmakers  and most important movie stars went to bed  the night before, thinking they were working  for the greatest movie studio  and woke up to find out they were working for  the worst streaming service.  There's going to be an issue of payment too,  because if box offices  hit, they don't, you know.  I saw a story, and I can't figure this out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess there's some kind of  prediction that it's in the contract  and it's going to reach that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It'll be HBO Max  maybe writing some checks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, but I also saw a story  I didn't put it up because it got too nerdy.  But it was  trying to compare, even with this,  even if they pay what is anticipated,  it's still less than what Netflix pays  to make stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here, we've gone  back and forth about this.  Initially I thought this was just kind of classic  antitrust behavior, AT&T,  saying, alright, now that we got all this content  we're just going to lock out  the movie theaters and own the distribution  as well.  But a number of people including Paul Theron on  Windows Weekly said, no, this is just  recognizing  the fact that nobody's going to be going into theaters  for quite some time.  Yeah.  They're going to lose money. It's going to cost them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  money. I also thought it was interesting  that story that you,  that's in the rundown,  sources said that  Warner Brothers COO  came up with the idea because they had a  weak slate of movies and this was a way  to basically hide  the stinkers while still  getting streaming revenue from  the good ones. Right. Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe.  It's cooking the books essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's also  promoting, I think,  HBO Max.  Which has done quite well. 12.6  million activations.  Engagement is up 36%  in the past month.  Weirdly though,  only 30% of the eligible HBO  subscribers have signed  up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got to get the word out. Was that sharing the password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What was that? Would you say it was sharing the password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just confusing. You don't know if you get it  for free or not. It's very confusing. I can't  figure it out to save my soul. Yeah, I think that's the problem.  I remember when  Stanky took over, when AT&T bought him,  he went into HBO and said  we're going to be more like Netflix.  A week later, HBO's  CEO Richard Peppler left and went  to Apple TV Plus.  And,  you know, I think they are more like Netflix, but that  might be a reasonable thing.  In fact, Stanky said that.  CEO of AT&T said, look,  the competition is not that  theaters are competing with us.  Theaters are competing with Netflix, Amazon Prime.  The competition is there's  an infinite amount of content you can watch at home.  Period.  So we're just doing where we're going to be where customers  want us to be.  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, makes sense. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was slamming  this as kind of classic antitrust behavior,  but maybe it's just sensible  playing, you know,  to the audience.  Let's see.  What else is in here?  Fire TV's adding local news in 12 US cities,  90 more coming in 2021.  I have to say YouTube TV is, to me,  the best alternative to cable  right now. I'm very happy with it.  Yeah, I think it's expensive,  but it's going to be expensive because  the local stations  are demanding it. You've got to pay them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't see much difference between  YouTube TV and Hulu TV.  Sorry for the construction noise  outside behind me.  But I did like the Hulu TV  UI, the user experience  a little bit better. Really? And I didn't like  that YouTube TV would  the history from whatever I watched  over there would show up on my regular web  version of YouTube. Yeah.  And it just screwed it down. That's very Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where everything's all mushed together, isn't it?  Yeah.  I really far prefer YouTube TV to  interface, but I guess  to each his own.  Why does Dionne Warwick  say deal with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People thought that  she wasn't really doing her tweets.  The tweets were so good  and they were insulting her.  So if you go down about three quarters of the way down this story,  she has a little video with a message  back to the doubters.  They are pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's 80 years old.  I don't know. Probably a lot of the youngs don't know  who Dionne Warwick was,  but she had many, many hits.  Including... Is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean all the musicians know for sure.  Chance the Rapper went bananas  because she referred to him.  She said, why do you have to put rapper in your name?  Like, we get it,  you're a rapper. Chance, he's a rapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She said, referring to the time  the YouTube album was forced onto  people's iPhones and iPods,  Do you think I would have warned you all about  iTunes making you have that YouTube album  if I were actually psychic?  November 14th.  Did you know that the artists can see  the names of the playlists you're adding to their songs?  Their songs to on Spotify?  Yeah, I didn't know that. That was new to me.  Something to consider.  She followed this up by pointing out the titles of various playlists  noting that Ho was spelled  wrong in one.  Ho, Ho, Ho, Merry Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spelled H-O-E.  She's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can Gen Z and Millennials please tell me why you're always  saying screaming or yelling? Why are you  shouting? Should I be shouting  as well? Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a video of her  answering people doubting her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what a hot girl is, tweets Deon Warwick.  But women support women  in this house. I'm happy to see kind people  receive recognition, that is all.  I'm turning 80. Please do not tell me what a  hot girl is.  After Warwick  tweeted about Megan  Thee Stallion's Grammy nomination,  later she said, thank you for telling  me what a hot girl is even though I specifically  asked you not to.  I love that.  If you're a very obviously  rapper, why do you put it in your stage name?  I cannot stop thinking about this.  I could be saying, Deon  the singer.  Can Gen Z, oh yeah we did that one.  The Weeknd  is next. Why?  It's not even spelled correctly.  There's no E and E and D.  The Weeknd.  Okay.  So where's the video? I'm looking here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to find it. It was here earlier today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These Twitter embeds don't always work well.  Yeah.  It's the Twitter.  Hold on, maybe I can find it.  Hold on.  Here's the video. I got it.  You got it? Okay good.  I love Deon Warwick.  God I love Deon Warwick.  2 million views on this video on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well hello.  And this is for all of you  tweeters who have decided  that I'm not tweeting my own stuff  to you. I want you  to know I am.  And I'm getting a very, very, very  good at it.  I have a wonderful niece. Her name is Brittany.  And she said, Deon,  you'll have a lot of fun if you get  on this with me. I said, okay,  teach me how to do it. And she did.  And I am doing it.  So best you quell  all of you naysayers.  And if it doesn't,  deal with it.  I'm following her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm following her. Isn't that the greatest?  She's just having fun trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That voice, I mean, even just  speaking that voice. She sounds so good.  Walk on by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What were some of her hits?  That's the one.  That's the one.  She had so many though.  And probably a lot of Christmas  I think a lot of Christmas stuff.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Chance the Rapper talked about it  on Ellen's show.  He was so jazzed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to see reddit's most  upvoted picture of 2020?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it safe for work?  It was not a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a photo of Rick Astley  posted by  Rick Astley. He's of course the  never gonna give you up.  The singer of the Rick  Roll. Never gonna give you up.  It's a multi-layered Rick Roll.  This is from my, so here's  the picture. I found a few  funny memories during lockdown. This is from my  first tour in 89 backstage  in Vegas.  Following Astley's, the second most upvoted  post from 2020 was a short story  posted in memes  dunking on a flat earther  changing YouTube video titles.  That's alright. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you heard of the Astley Paradox?  No. What is the Astley  Paradox? When you ask  Rick Astley for the movie  Give You Up.  Never gonna give you up.  He can't give it to you. But he can't let you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a paradox.  That's a paradox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a paradox.  That's a paradox.  Critical flaws in millions of IOT  devices may never get fixed.  So what else is new?  Stacy.  So what else is new?  Look, I gotta go play Cyberpunk 2077.  Let's finish  this up.  Oh, this is good news. And we haven't reported  elsewhere. And I do want to talk  about this. The FCC has finally  concluded its investigation  on passengers  using their cell phones  in flight.  The FCC  started this back with  Tom Wheeler in 2013.  Now, seven years  later, they have reached a verdict  No.  I don't think so. Doesn't matter.  No.  Not gonna do it.  The FCC says you cannot  use your cell phone. By the way, thank you,  Boing Boing, Mark Fraunfelder for that  clip part.  There's strong opposition to the commission's  proposals from many commenters in this proceeding,  including our nation's airline  pilots and flight attendants.  So, no. You can't, sorry,  you can't use your cell phone  in flight.  So there.  Should we, I think  we should get to our picks of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you elaborate on that one more time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sir? You cannot use  your cell phone in flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, as in  Wi-Fi connected. Make a phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they,  so back in 2013,  you remember every time you get on a plane, they said  turn off your cell phone. You can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and I thought that was because of the connection to the  towers. That was a lie. Supposedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was all a lie. They said interfere with our electronics.  Bulls. Pocky.  So the FCC  finally, you know, said, all right, we'll look into this.  And it wasn't, they didn't,  you know, nobody wanted  that guy sitting on  3C. And then I  told him, I am not going to  shout in his stuff all  over the airplane. And  so even though there is no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why you mad at me, buddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no technical  reason why you shouldn't use  your cell phone in flight. Actually, there's one technical  reason, but it doesn't hurt the plane.  It hurts your phone because the  cells are moving so fast beneath you  that the handoffs happening so fast  that it will kill your battery.  But other than that,  yeah,  and the FCC said no.  I remember Nick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bilton helped, he wrote  about that, and he helped them  admit that basically  there was no problem with it.  He asked somebody, he asked a scientist,  so I did a rough survey  and something like 60% of people  never turned the phones off. So if  there was a problem, wouldn't planes be falling out of the sky  all the time? Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's huge.  That was a big story by Nick.  Disruptions, want calls  on planes? You'll need to speak up  December 1st, 2013.  Thank you for  giving him some credit  for the expose.  It was his crusade.  He lost.  Nick Bilton. Although, honestly  he kind of won because thanks to Nick,  you can use your iPad,  you can use your devices, you couldn't even  do those, remember?  So you can use your computers  and your devices on planes, but you can't make  phone calls. You can't  make phone calls. It's funny,  I forgot about that, I'm glad you remember  that, Matthew. Credit  to Nick.  Alright, our last commercial  of the day, and then we  will get your picks if you don't mind.  In just a bit. It's great to have  Matthew Ingram here from the CJR.  From the fabulous  I forgot the name of it. Craig  Narmark, Newmark Graduate School of  Journalism. How could you  forget? I don't know why.  I forgot his name.  Jeff Jarvis and  Ant Pruitt from Hands On Photography,  Hands On Wellness. Our show today brought to you by  Linode. I've known Linode  forever. Had a Linode account forever too.  They were the very first, as I remember,  to offer virtual machines  in the cloud running on SSDs  super fast.  Making  your complex cloud  infrastructure easy  is their goal. They believe  in cloud computing for all.  They've made deploying, managing,  and scaling cloud applications  simple. They've been doing it longer than practically  anybody else, and they're still  the best. That's why 800,000  developers use Linode.  Let me tell you why I use Linode.  Eleven global data centers  all over the world, flat rate  pricing on every single one.  I love the cloud manager. Makes it  really easy to provision a server,  get it up and running, set it up with the  software you want, and shut it down  when you're done with it. They have a wonderful  API. It's full featured.  And maybe the best thing about  Linode, they have the best customer  support anywhere. 24  7, 365  days a year. They don't hand  you off. There's no tears.  I'm going to have to get my manager, none of that.  And it doesn't matter if you're a big guy or  a little guy, because I'm a little guy.  They will take care of you. It doesn't matter.  You can host your website.  You can build your app. It's fun  for me playing in the development  space. You need a server out there. And it's really  fun for me to have a quick, easy,  inexpensive server I can spin up and then spin  down when I'm done. And you know,  one of these days one of my MVPs  is going to take off and then I can spin  it up even bigger. It'll scale  one of these. One of these  days you can use it to back up  media. You can use it to store media. Whatever  you want to do. Easily launch and enrich your  developer applications. Hosted  service. You love Kubernetes and  Docker. It's great for that. Websites.  You want to do machine learning.  They've got GPUs.  They have machine learning  instances. You can do gaming  services, CI, CD,  environments. You can  launch in the cloud. You can scale in the cloud.  Start small,  grow big. Those virtual machines are great.  And we're going to start you with  a lot. A hundred dollar credit  on S3  compatible object storage, manage  Kubernetes and more. In addition to  shared and dedicated compute instances.  You are going to love Linode.  I know you've heard about it. L-I-N-O-D-E.  Surely you have.  If you haven't,  get to know Linode. They're the greatest.  They have a new YouTube channel  for video tutorials, security tips  and more. I really like this. It makes it easy to get started.  YouTube.com slash Linode.  Some great  customer testimonials. We just picked them at  random. Bryce Adams from Meteoric says,  quote, from the start we were looking for a partner,  not a provider. Some of the  large providers see us as just a transaction.  Linode is the kind of  partner that will be with us from the start. Today and  beyond.

I'm going to let Matthew,  you got a good pick this week.  Let's let Matthew kick things off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it trenchant perhaps?  It's trenchant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pretty trenchant.  You mentioned, well the  link to the homicide  video reminded me of this  Julia Stiles clip  from I think it was 94.  And she was in  this show called Ghostwriter.  She was a kid.  She was hilarious. I think she was on the school  newspaper. And she was  educating her fellow  teen in hacker culture.  It's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. I have a couple of picks. I like  this one. I'm going to show you this one.  I love what you can do online these days.  I'm doing the advent of coding  competition. That's great fun. This is  for people who want to design a computer  from scratch.  It's NAND game. N-A-N-D  G-A-M-E  No flash involved.  You're going to start  by building a  simple computer starting with a  NAND gate.  As the fundamental building block.  You're going to build everything else.  Your first task is to build  an inverter. You read  to the left of the diagram for the exact  specification of the task below the diagram.  Further elaboration.  Here is all  the information you need to know.  This would be suitable for a  smart sixth or seventh grader.  Somebody who's interested in  computing. And it's  kind of fun because it's graphical. Here's a NAND  gate. We're going to drag it into the  space here. We're going to connect  the  output.  And we're going to  connect the input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it explain what a NAND  gate is? It does.  It does. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's connect that to that.  I have to put this up here.  Connect this to  this. Let's see if we get that.  No. Components are  so it's an inverter.  It has a single input, a single output. The output should be  the opposite of the input.  So zero for one. So we're going to flip it.  Oh, what am I thinking?  I should put it on the top. Yep.  Dummy.  Dummy, dummy. Do you think that's it, John?  Will I get a zero out?  I've completed the level. Let's see. No.  No. I screwed  up. I'm going to have to play with  this a little bit more. Level is not correct.  Believe me, it starts simple.  Available in English, Russian,  and Chinese. It's free.  Although there's a donation button.  And you're going to see, here's all the levels.  And at the end, you'll actually get  a working computer.  I think a great way to learn the basics  of computing.  Which more and more people should be learning.  Because if we don't have  people who can build computers, what

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are we going to do?  Can you make something that you can play Doom on?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's amazing what you can play  Doom on. Let me just say,  I shouldn't say no.  Jeff, your number of the week.  By the way, that's NAND game.  N-A-N-D-G-A-M-E. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My favorite  email newsletter for  Things for the Show.  Benedict Evans.  Like to this. And it's weird,  but I liked it. It's just a medium page  by a guy named Tom Witwell.  52 Things I Learned in 2020.  Oh, it's really good. I picked out a few of the goodies here.  One, most cities  plant only male trees because it's expensive  and it's not going to clear up the fruit that falls from female trees.  Male trees release pollen,  and that's one of the reasons your hay fever is getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We put in olive trees,  about 30 of them, and if you ever  had an olive tree, it drops black olives  everywhere. So  we only put in the male except  apparently there was a female snuck in there.  Because now we got olives everywhere.  The trees had a very good time making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It took six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting. That's why your hay fever is getting worse.  That's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two, in China, a simple smiley face  emoji doesn't mean  happy. It means a despising, mocking,  even obnoxious attitude. What?  Use these instead. Happy face with  bared teeth, happy face with mouth  open. Oh, I wish I'd learned that.  Number 11. Yes.  Doctors in a private, no, I'm sorry,  Euro English is an involving  pigeon English used by  EU administrators.  For example, using handy to meet a mobile phone,  that's German. No?  To turn any sentence into a question.  And unusual pluralals like  expertises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you've ever been to Montreal, you know  bonjour, hello is the greeting of the day.  Right? Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I happen to know  what I love about European languages  is that information can be plural.  You get informations. Oh,  okay. Number 14.  The inventor of the pixel  died in 2020, aged 91.  He always regretted making pixels square.  Describing the decision as something very foolish  that everyone in the world has been suffering from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ever since. In fact, he spent the rest of his  life trying to design a non-square  pixel.  And failed. Number 17.  Number 13.  Oh, we got a request. 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, you read that one, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when users download the  Canyon mobile app,  mobile loans app, Ocash,  terms and conditions give it permission to access  their contacts, so if they fall behind  in payments, the app starts to message  their contacts. Oh, no.  To shame them into repaying the debt.  I bet that works. That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's brilliant.  Number 17. Nearly 10% of the revenue of the  nation of Tuvalu comes from,  you know what, the .tv  domain. Yes. Which we use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Number 26. We're sending some of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  money to them. Do you know what the rest of their revenue  comes from? What?  Bat guano. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fertilizer. You know, the bat guano is not  going to last forever, guys. We've got to find another  income stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tuvalu is not going to  last forever. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Number 26. A fully  dressed 20th century man would  carry 78  buttons and have 24 pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who? What?  20th century man? What?  Well, early 20th century. Early 20th century.  I'm going to say maybe 19th century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would think so, more like that.  And then number 49.  Wow. The gas bags,  like me and Leo,  inside hydrogen air ships  of the 1930s were made  from the outer layer of a cow's  intestines. Joined together when  wet, the living tissues grow together,  creating an impermeable bond.  The gas bags of the Graf Zeppelin  were made from the guts of around a half  million cows. Those Germans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So ingenious.  This is fantastic.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My favorite was when they first started  public swimming  pools in England.  They displayed frogs in tubs  at the pool so that you  could watch the frog and learn  what you were supposed to do, I guess, in the swimming pool.  This is an, I researched it.  This is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another one. When you lose  one kilogram of weight, around  840 grams of that weight is  exhaled as carbon dioxide.  Wow. So you're bad for the environment  if you take a diet. Stay fat.  You're burning that fat and breathing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  out the carbon dioxide.  Thank you, Jeff. That's  easy to find. Just search for  Flux on Medium.  The title, 52 Things I Learned  in 2020 by Tom Whitwell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you go down to the bottom, he's done it  for the last, I think, six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he must just collect these all year  long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's schtick. You love schtick.  Schtick's great. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And finally, Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I had three things listed there.  First one is adobe  stock.adobie.com  slash free. They've just added  a whole bunch of different assets  out there for content creators  because people are trying to get  some work and come up with different ideas  and having a lot of extra additional  free stock assets can help  speed things up and I've been picking  through it. Saw a couple different motion graphic  templates that I have some ideas for  for like the  moral panic button and things like that.  But yeah, check that out.  It's free as long as you have an adobe  ID, which is free.  You can download them and  license them for nothing.  Number two, I have a quick  tease. Subscribe  to my YouTube channel because  I've been playing around with this little android phone  here. This is a TCL  10 5G  or 5G.  And it's not a thousand  dollars and I like it.  That's a good start.  $399.99. It's not a thousand dollars.  I like it. Yeah.  $400 and it's got some pretty nice  performance on it. Big battery too.  Nice. So yeah, I'm going to  talk about that on my YouTube channel  here soon. But lastly,  the main thing I wanted to touch on is  a gentleman named Darian  Rentscher from  the University of  Jefferson South Kaki Laki, also known as  my hometown.  But he's also a senior football  player for Clemson University.  He recently won the  Disney Disney Award  for sportsmanship. And  in addition to that,  the same week that he won that  he was he had a long  50 yard touchdown run in the game.  He's a like a fourth  string running back on the team.  What I like to realize is he's the  emotional leader of the team.  He's not a starter. He's not the star.  But he's the emotional leader.  And when it was time to  lead up things regarding the social  injustice and the protest and  getting the message out, he was  the main guy.  And everybody just corralled around him.  You don't have to be the captain of the star.  If you look at that third link of him running the football  running for the touchdown,  when he scores, the  bench clears. Everybody is so  happy for this kid because they know how  much he means to the to the to the team  and how much he means to the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There he goes, there he goes, there he goes, go there and go.  Yeah, all the way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's awesome.  He's going to be fine life after football.  He's got a lot of different things going on.  He'll do a lot better if he doesn't get into professional

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  football, you know. Right.  I think that's really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But yeah, I wanted to shout him out.  That was a great story last week.  Look at that timed out greatly for him.  That's great. So cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to watch that again. I love that kind of  I love that kind of play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody just and again, when he  scored, you could see the whole bench.  Oh, yeah. Took off. Everybody  wanted to be down there, which is clearly  a penalty. You can't run down there.  Oh, that's so cute. Yeah.  Stay out of the field. Oh, they're so happy for  him. Everybody's down there.  Isn't that neat? That's a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  story when there's somebody who's in a  star athlete, but he's a star  on the team because of who he is.  That's really awesome.  That's not you, because you  also could beat the crap out of  him.  It's really you're both, I guess,  Ant. You're both our inspiration and our  star athlete. So thank you,  Ant Pruitt. Hands on photography, hands on  wellness. What's your YouTube  channel? Give us the link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  YouTube.com slash Ant Pruitt.  Well, that was hard.  I've had some fun over there.  I have a bunch of tutorials over there  that are photography related or video  related or just vlogs,  you know, just here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube.com slash Ant Pruitt.
