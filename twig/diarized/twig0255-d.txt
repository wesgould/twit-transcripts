The Google I.O. conference started this morning and lo and behold, look who's here.  Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani came up over the bridge.  Here we are.  Over the river and through the woods.  And over the bridge.  And over the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And over the bridge. We didn't even talk about the bridge going over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it was flying because somebody else drove and it was foggy.  Oh, did you have a Uber?  We were chatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you had Walt?  No, we had Walt.  Walt's great. Love Walt.  Walt will keep you occupied.  So, welcome, first of all.  Thank you.  Nice to have you in the studio.  So great to be here.  We covered it this morning. Kevin Marks and party host.  Covered it and covered it and covered it.  We started at 9 and it went to almost two and a half hours.  A very long keynote speech.  And so long that I think a lot of the interesting things were buried in a lot of needless detail.  But there is some good news for those who went to Google I.O.  Cardboard. This is the gift.  Wait a minute. We should say you did get a certificate good for either an LG G-Watch or a Samsung Gear Live.  Yes.  And you're going to get a Moto 360 whenever that comes out.  Right. Later this year, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you are currently... nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only thing we walked up.  Watch, watch, because I can just take this and I'm going to put it together.  It's a little kit. If you're really ingenious and smart enough, you just take it and there it is.  It turns into...  Turns into...  Wait a minute. What the hell is that?  Okay. Now you put a phone in there.  Will it work with any smartphone?  Yeah, any smartphone.  It has to run Android. Did you have to install an Android app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's a Chrome experiment, which is actually not currently loaded up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how does it... Oh, so you have to load it on the phone.  Yeah, you have to load the Chrome experiment on the phone.  So what happens is this is a stereo... you remember this.  This is like the View Master and you press the thing.  But instead of a View Master, you've loaded it with a phone.  And then watch, I'm going to put it to my eyes.  And then, oh, look, I see the stars. The stars are beautiful.  Wait a minute, what's that? And if you look at it long enough, you get...  What's really interesting is just like the Oculus Rift, this moves with your head pretty quickly.  Take that, Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cardboard rift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much did he pay for Oculus? Four billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently this was a 20% time project with Google engineers.  We'll have to see what they could do with cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to g.co. slash cardboard, you can see it yourself.  And even build it yourself if you really wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, not to pull it on Leo here, Gina spent quite a good while in the car figuring it out.  And I never would have figured it out.  Well, I had no difficulty at all.  She was sticking her tongue out a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there is an app, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't... I didn't... RTFM at all.  I was like, I don't care. I'm sure that I could just stick the tabs where they need to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There aren't much less than Ikea style directions, right?  It's true. There really weren't directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina made it all, figured it out.  And then she finally went to the page and said, oh, instructions.  Oh, right here. That's usually how it works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Virtual reality has made exciting progress over the past several years.  This really isn't up yours to mark, is it?  It is.  The result is cardboard and no frills enclosure that transforms a phone into a basic VR headset.  And the accompanying open software toolkit.  You know what? This really is a little bit of a takeoff on that thing that the Motorola X does with the hat.  Yeah, the hat.  Which allows you... It's actually kind of fun.  Play a game and aim up and down and move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I bet if we loaded up the hat and stuck it in the cardboard, it would probably be really cool.  And it uses the accelerator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's cooler than this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  They didn't mention that at all.  Not at all.  Although you did get an upgrade to 2 gigabytes, but you have to buy it.  2 gigabytes of RAM and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As soon as Jeff saw the watch demo, he turned around to me and said,  Getting rid of this.  Went into his glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two thirds of the functionality of this are now gone.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  So there you have it.  That was the big giveaway today.  I think it's going to be a little easier to get into Google I.O. next year.  I'm just guessing that...  But I said this.  I said, Google, of course you're going to have trouble with Google I.O.  We had to try like the Dickens to get Gina in.  We had to whine and drink.  I really appreciate that.  Thank you, folks, for letting us both in.  But I think part of that was because they gave away last year,  they gave away a lot of stuff the year before, a lot of stuff.  And it seems like a good deal to spend, what is it, 900 bucks to get in?  And get more than that worth of goodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, the Pixel was a $1,500 machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Suitable for sale on eBay.  I bought this one. Let's be clear. I love this one.  You can make money at it.  But I think this is not going to sell for much on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Let's look.  I just get two watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get your choice of the Samsung or the LG and then the Moto later.  So which ones should we get?  Did they give any more information about these watches,  like what they're going to sell for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said they would be on sale in the Play Store this afternoon.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when they go on sale, I guess we'll then know how much it's going to be.  But they didn't say a price and they didn't even say anything more than Moto 360 available sometime this summer.  Which was what they were saying all along.  But we did see it is circular, right?  In fact, I think Sundar Pichai was wearing a circular watch.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $250, I think, is what we talked about.  $199. The Gear Live will be available for pre-order later today, $199.99.  So the Gear 2 is 300 bucks.  LG is $229.  Okay.  Pre-release announced.  Okay.  Which one are you going to pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which one should I?  Oh, you're asking me like I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what the difference is.  I mean, your view, I think, is Samsung's been making any error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually don't.  I like the Gear 2.  I mean, it's limited as though they are.  I liked it.  The problem is it was a very Samsung-specific device.  It may be the case with the...  In fact, that's what you should find out.  It probably won't work with your Nexus or your HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I got the impression it's Android Wear, so it talks to Android no matter what.  See, that would be great.  I mean, right?  That's what it ought to be.  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there were some important things today, and we'll go over them all, but going across platform easily was really one of the main points.  And how the coming together of Android and Chrome, and that's how they're going across platforms so that you can have an Android app on your computer.  Your Android app can talk to your watch.  Your watch is syncing with your Android app.  I mean, it really has gotten fairly impressive going across here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I made notes as we talked until my energy gave out and I just collapsed in a puddle.  And we can go through this one by one.  They did, of course, start as every of these big...  This is, by the way, the fourth big company developers keynote we've seen.  It started with Build, Microsoft's Build, gosh, months ago.  Then WWDC, Facebook's F8 conference.  You could throw in the Amazon phone announcement.  It wasn't a developer announcement.  You could throw that in, and now Google gets kind of the last word with Google I.O.  This was the longest, had the least sales pitch stuff in it, and easily the most developer specific stuff.  Way more specific than any of the others.  But they did begin with a little bit of marketing.  They said Android now has one billion monthly active users.  One billion with a B.  Easily dwarfing...  iOS has 800 million, but only of the 800 million, only 600 million are phones.  But I guess you're including tablets here, too.  So one billion...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the great little swipes was it doesn't include Amazon, but that wouldn't be very much.  He didn't mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon is Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were a few very subtle swipes at Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple, too.  And Microsoft.  They didn't want to talk about Microsoft, but a number of things were targeted at Microsoft.  Twenty billion text messages a day sent over Android.  Ironically, that dwarfs the number of text messages sent over WhatsApp.  I looked it up, but it was more than that.  I think it was 23 billion or more a day.  So as many text messages are sent over Android, more are sent over WhatsApp.  So it doesn't dwarf it. It's the opposite. What's the opposite of dwarfing it?  It giants it.  93 million selfies a day.  This is not something I would tout.  Yeah, no, no.  It's an art form.  That's got to be a joke, because how do you know it's a selfie?  Facial recognition.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which way the camera is pointed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know it's a selfie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. That's true.  62% of tablets globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big deal, because the other 38% is iPads.  So I think that's all. They didn't have to go into Toxic Health, too, or anything like that.  They just had to say, well, we've got a billion monthly active users. What do you got?  Yep.  They did, before they announced the L word, they announced, by the way, that's what's going to be called the L word.  I just thought you'd like to know.  You're happy about that?  No. The real L word.  Before they announced that, Android One, which is a platform, an interesting platform, looks like a turnkey platform  for handset makers in the developing world that allows them to quickly and easily make sub-$100 Android phones with Google services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With guaranteed updates, with all kinds of things.  Yeah, guaranteed updates was interesting.  Security, and it's appropriate to the market, so that you always want, I don't know why in India you always want double sims, but you do.  And radio, FM radio.  FM radio, which is important in the market, and under $100.  I was surprised they didn't give that away, just to say, look, people, look what you can do, and it's going to explode mobile to the left.  I mean, the big thing today was, to me, this is a mobile company. It is mobile, mobile, mobile.  They even said that. They said we're going to talk about mobile.  Design it in mobile. And by the way, you can also make that quaint thing we used to call a web browser.  It'll expand nicely for the web as well.  Yeah, yeah. It was do it for mobile. That was the whole message of the day to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Play supports auto-installation of local content, so you can distribute these phones with local relevant apps that will just get auto-updated, which looks and sounds really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also kind of said, and this was a response to Toxic Health, Stu, that 93% of all Android phones do at least have the latest version of Play.  And they are going to start distributing security updates via Play, doing an end-around on the carrier's end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I said on Twitter, that's their end-around around fragmentation. But somebody else said, well, look at what L is bringing.  That's why updates do matter, because there's tons of functionality and design that comes to L that's not going to be in a Play update.  That won't come through Play services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this has always been a problem. It's not that people don't want the latest version of Android. It's the carriers and manufacturers don't put it on their phones.  And so you have a hard time getting it.  And people are not really willing to get a new phone just so they can get the latest version of Android, I think.  The latest version will be L. We know that K is KitKat. J was Jelly Bean. H, you know, and then on back. They're all desserts.  So we know it'll be L, but we don't know which dessert they haven't announced it.  Lychee, licorice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Kevin Marks had an unusual suggestion we heard.  Laffy Taffy.  Laffy Taffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Jason last night. I thought it was Kevin suggested Lint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  L-I-N-D-T. I don't think it'll be Lint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should also be another brand. It doesn't quite fit. That brand doesn't quite fit. It's not quite KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason's joke was Laffy Taffy.  Maybe it may well be given that they made a relationship and I'm sure made some money on KitKat making a relationship with Nestle.  Maybe they'll do the same thing with Pharrell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe and that deal just hasn't closed. That's why we're just calling it L.  Lemonheads.  I found it strange referring to it as L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have the little doll ready for the yard?  Yeah, right. The statue hasn't been shipped yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is one thing they said is we want to let developers look at the new version of Android much earlier from now on.  So this really is a release or an announcement of a release of an SDK well before the version comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean there's a tremendous amount of design changes here with the material design stuff, the new themes.  This is something that developers want to get ahead of time to get ahead of before it gets released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Apple announced four thousand new APIs with iOS 8. Now they've got five thousand.  Five thousand new APIs.  But I thought having to learn five thousand new APIs, it wasn't a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. It made me feel just kind of tired when I heard that.  It was kind of overwhelming.  I had a long to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you do that?  I mean each new API reflects either a change in the way you interact with an existing service or a new service entirely.  And do you just wait till you need something and look it up or do you kind of browse it and say, well, let's see what I can do.  I mean, this is how you can't you don't learn all five thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you don't learn all five thousand.  I mean, it really depends for something like Android where this is a whole new device is a whole new category.  You want to be ahead of this curve.  You want when these watches hit the market for your app to be awesome on it.  You want your app to be in the demos.  So that's something that you go ahead of go ahead on and try to learn all the Android where APIs and make your app do something special and interesting.  The rest of the five thousand.  You know, look, you have you have an idea for something you want to build.  If it's if it's difficult, you do some research.  Does this new thing make it easier?  And I do this.  You use it as you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you understand the basic outline of what's capable.  Right.  Yeah.  And by the way, Tim, correct me on Twitter.  That's right.  Apple said eight hundred million devices sold to date, not eight hundred million active users.  So yeah, I've got a few.  I've got a few old on you.  Yeah.  So a billion monthly active users is a big deal.  That's a big deal.  That's that's Facebook numbers.  They did release SDKs for almost all the new stuff.  Yeah.  Including the L. What do they call it?  The L. The L release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Release L preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you mind if I call it the L word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not at all.  That was the first thing that came to mind for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As the spokesman for the entire community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I give you permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's what leaves to mind.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they introduced Matias Duarte, who was Chilean wearing a houndstooth check coat and  a paisley shirt, which moiread miserably on camera.  He's in charge of the look and feel of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever the show producer.  This is Google's definition of design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also had I don't I'm I'm just saying the beard looked a little like the guy in the  Silicon Valley, the Aviato.  Yeah.  I'm not sure this is the guy you want developing, but it does look nice.  It does look nice.  It does.  Paul Thoreau was at Great Pains to point out that this is kind of what Windows Phone's  done.  The grid, the active tiles, things when you tap them move.  They at first I thought because he said material design, I thought, what are they going to  change the material they showed a screen and had things up.  But no, they're just the feeling that something's coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an X, Y and a Z.  Now there's a Z.  Yeah, there's a Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So you can have floating like buttons floating on top and feel and feel distance.  I didn't ask you, but last night on All About Android, you all predicted what you'd think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you were going to see at Google I.O.  How close do you think you came?  We did OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were on a few things.  I didn't think Android TV was going to happen today.  We were very pro.  I thought that the show I thought that they were going to lead off the show with Android  Wear and Fit.  Right.  Like that seemed like the most obvious new consumer things.  And that was sort of more toward the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like this was an opportunity lost a little bit that they know.  I understand this is a developer conference.  And we say that before we do before we did build before we did WWDC.  And before this we say, look, this developer conference, this is messaging for developers.  But you do have and this particularly with Google I.O.  All the press was there.  There was we couldn't get anybody to help me on the show because everybody said, no,  no, I got to cover this.  I got to be there.  This is a this is really important event.  And I feel like that they didn't do a lot of consumer messaging where that's a little  bit of a missed opportunity.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's definitely a tension, right?  Because this is the thing.  They have to lay the groundwork with the developers.  I think the developers excited and that to convince the developers that if they build  for this, they're going to make money and they're going to be successful before the  consumer launch.  The consumer launch.  Sorry, sorry.  Sorry, sorry.  Especially that chopping.  Sorry, sorry.  So the consumer launch can be, you know, can have the apps and have the support for things  that consumers want.  And it's tough.  It's a tough tension.  I mean, I felt there are times when there have been developer conferences where I felt  like this was this was obviously should have just been a press event.  Like this is a show for consumers.  And that that bugs me.  Right.  Because it really is not that.  I understand that.  You're developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Then don't invite all the press there.  Just say this isn't for you.  This is geek time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think Apple showed at WWDC that you can split the difference, that you can have  a show that's really for developers.  And of course, it's the breakout sessions that come later that are really for developers.  You could have left a lot of that, especially towards the end in breakout sessions and not  you would have shortened the keynote and you wouldn't have diluted this message.  We as it is, we have to dig for nuggets in this pile of stuff that.  Yeah.  And it's a big pile.  It's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot of good material.  I just feel like they structured it well enough.  I don't think they demonstrate.  I think your point is right, Leo, that they could have demonstrated more to real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, you can write an app to call for pizza.  Right.  That's that was cool.  That speaks to people.  Yeah, that's cool.  So they didn't make it real enough because they had so much material.  They buried the lead.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the lead?  I don't know.  Our job is, I'll tell you in a moment.  Our job is to dig and find the pony in that pile of information that Google has given  us and we will find the pony in just a little bit.  Jeff Jarvis, nice to have you in studio.  Always a wonder.  I'm so happy.  I think Mike and Jason, Mike Elgin and Jason are on their way back.  They may have stuck around a little longer than you did, but if they do show up, we'll  get them on the panel as well.  I really thought they were going to say, and we're creating with Nest a hub for your  home and your automation and we're going to base it on Android Home and none of that.  Right.  But that's good news for smart things.  If you want to automate your home, we've been looking for ages for a way to do this simply  to find a hub that will talk.  You know, at home, I've got the Hue lights.  I've got the Sonos.  I want to get the Schlage door that unlocks.  Automatically, I want my curtains to open automatically when the sun comes up and close  when the sun goes down.  All of those things and smart things has actually put together a hub that is very, very cool.  I want to show you.  This is the smart things hub.  It is.  I want to say this was a Kickstarter project.  I'm trying to remember where this was.  And I actually backed it.  Yeah.  And I and I got the kit and I love it.  I can tell you about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us about it.  And I'll let you know.  I'll tell you what they told me to tell you and then you could tell me what you want to tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the hub is the thing that communicates with everything else.  And it does work across a lot of different platforms.  GE, Schlage.  I have a list here.  Honeywell, Eon, Nest works.  Absolutely.  Phillips Hue works.  The Wemo, which is Belkin's really cool little sensors.  Now you can get a kit and that's probably what you got.  The basic kit, the smart home security kit.  Three hundred twenty nine bucks.  You're going to get the hub.  You get a smart sense motion sensor.  So you could put this in the hallway to know when you know when you get home.  Lots of different things you could do with the motion sensor.  Obviously put it in the garage or outside to turn on the lights.  The smart sense presence sensor, which is kind of a neat thing.  You could put it on a key chain to let you know when the keys have left the house or on your dog or your cat.  To let you know when the cat has run away.  It'll tell you when people or cars arrive and leave your home.  It can help you where you found your left or left your keys.  This is really cool.  You get one of those as well.  You also get the multi, which is really the most amazing thing.  It looks a lot like those sensors that you've seen on alarm systems that go on windows.  And you could certainly use it that way.  It's a two piece thing.  So when you open the window, the connection is broken.  But this does more than that.  It's got sensors in here that tell you the temperature.  It's got an accelerometer.  It can alert you if you've left the garage door open.  It can do all sorts of things.  So you get this whole kit with this basic smart things kit that'll turn your home into a smart home within minutes because it's very easy to pair.  You just pull the tab out of the device.  It all pairs up very automatically.  No wires to run.  No wires to run.  It all plugs in.  It's all wireless.  And there is a growing community, over 5,000 developers now, who are creating new ways to use smart things.  The Smarter Home Security Kit adds an additional motion sensor, a smart power outlet, a siren and strobe alarm.  And then the Smartest Kit for $599 gives you all of the stuff I mentioned plus an additional presence sensor.  You get a power outlet.  That's nice.  You can put a light on there that turns on when you get home.  And an outdoor light plug and control power outlet.  So that's really nice.  So pick your kit and then use the offer code TWIT10 at checkout.  And you'll get free shipping within the US and 10% off the purchase of any home security kit.  So yeah, I remember when this was a Kickstarter project.  And it was really designed to make this whole process a lot easier.  So you backed it.  What was it that got you excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I backed the project.  I hadn't done a whole lot of playing around with home automation stuff, but it was a friend of a friend.  And the video got me.  And so I backed the project.  This is, gosh, this is September of 2012.  This is a couple of years ago now.  Has it been that long?  Yeah.  And I just loved it.  It was such a great product that the app was beautiful.  The things were awesome.  They raised a lot of money.  1.2 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did.  They raised 1.2 million.  You see how far the hub has come.  That was the original hub.  Yeah.  And look how nice and sleek it is.  It's nice and small now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely a more polished product.  It's a prototype.  But yeah, I had it set up so that my lights came on when the sun went down at night, which was nice.  I had the motion detector hooked up to my mailbox.  So I got a push notification on my phone when the mail came, which was really fun.  Works with Android or iPhone, right?  Yeah, Android or iPhone.  And I put the little presence detector on my daughter's stroller because I just like to know when she went in and out for a walk during the day.  So I'd be at work and say, oh, they got home.  They left because I don't have a cat.  And also the motion detector, we had it on our safe.  If you have a gun box or something, if it moves, you get a push notification.  So yeah, it was really fun and really easy to set up.  And I enjoyed it.  Gun box?  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  It seemed like, no, I don't.  But you know, it's Brooklyn, man.  It is Brooklyn.  Things are tough in Brooklyn.  You need weapons.  Not in the house of my daughter, which is as an example.  We put it on our safe, but we don't have a gun box.  But if you did and you had a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now they're out in the public, in the world, thanks to people like Gina who helped support the project originally.  And really, this is a refined, beautiful project that works so well.  I'm not going to show you my welcome code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't, because then you'll get taken over.  You'll need another one.  It's a great product.  I really love it.  I was excited to see that there is sponsor.  I have my set at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really excited about the whole idea.  I want to get in home automation.  That's why I was a little disappointed that Google didn't say a word one about this.  I feel like, well, it's going to be Google or Apple.  Somebody is going to take step up.  Maybe it's smart things is going to step up and just say, all right, forget it.  What I like about this is everybody make your own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now we can start working across multiple platforms, get some standards.  Right now you've got these silos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not working.  It just doesn't work.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're digging.  We're going to find a pony in here somewhere.  What do you think of the new as he as Mattias started showing the grids and the new design, I thought of you immediately.  In fact, for most of this, I thought of Gina Trepanning immediately because I figured you're going to be our expert on this.  How different is this?  What I do know that one of the complaints I hear people like Andy and not go for years, I tried to get him using Android phone.  He said, no, it's just not as elegant.  Things don't line up.  It just feels.  And for years, Android did feel that way.  So a little ill designed, a little clunky.  These new tools are obviously designed to address that.  Does this give the L release a parody with the beautifully designed iPhone?  You think I think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I was very impressed with the material design stuff.  And I'm very excited about my app, even my app, which is just a simple list app.  And most apps are right where you're just scrolling down a list.  It's going to make just those just the spacing and the and the nice natural scroll action.  Having that hover button, I thought I really liked a lot having the sticky headers that that like just just naturally sort of contract as you scroll up.  It looked really beautiful to me.  And I'm excited about it.  I think that I think that the complaint that Android is just not as pretty or not pretty enough or not as aesthetically pleasing.  I think that that's that's a done deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was kind of a done deal.  Matthias started at Honeycomb and has slowly gradually moved this to a much better looking.  Yes, he has.  I think it's been a done deal since KitKat.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they show when they show the side by side of Gmail, the current Gmail with with the new Gmail using the material design.  I mean, it really felt like a breath of fresh air.  The new the new screen is that they could have done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's aesthetics.  But now the paisley helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm not going to mock him, but he did have some odd stuff to wear anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then the hipster was the guy with the black that you couldn't see the black t-shirt.  Oh, yeah.  It was it was an oddly he was a director of Android engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was an odd.  It was an odd shirt.  It was odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They all got the odd shirt memo.  They got the wear the watch memo and the odd shirt.  They all were wearing smart watches whose screens were blanked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we couldn't really tell what they were using.  But we but it was obvious, especially the two women who presented because as always with smart watches with a smaller wrist, these things really look clunky.  Yeah.  And I don't think they were able to dress them up to the point where they didn't look a little clunky.  I was just looking at the LG G site and they try to make them look glamorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go to the and they did that at the keynote a little bit, there was a shot of somebody leaning up against the pool table being all hipster and stylish wearing the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing that I did like about the watch is that it's black until you hold it up and then it goes full color.  The gear to does that.  It's always on here.  She does that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because you don't want to leave the screen on all the time because it'll kill the battery.  So you when you move it, when you raise it, it turns on.  Right.  Pebble does that.  You hear they're trying to make it look glamorous.  Oh, yeah.  So what is that search for LG G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As you'll see, you'll see immediately what you'll see the site if you're watching the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they have videos of the watch.  Let's see.  Oh, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what Jeff is talking about.  First, there was the sun.  Then this is the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Watch search for LG G.  Watch.  Oh, man.  LG G.  Watch.  So they lead with her style.  They lead with.  Yeah, they do.  That's the interesting thing.  Powered by Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've got big rings.  So my.  Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know it, but I'm a champion arm wrestler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that does not look good.  That really does not look good.  Now, it looks more awkward on him there than it does on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nurds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Double nerds.  That's big.  This is the part where you're like, oh, I'm going to be a big guy.  I'm going to be a big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to be a big guy.  I'm going to be a big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to be a big guy.  That's big.  This is the problem with these things.  They have to be big because they have to have a big battery.  And of course, the screen has to be usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an opportunity for a larger wristed model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works well with the MERS, I think, don't you?  It's not a MERS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a European carry all.  Nice Volkswagen.  Love that.  Yeah.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm definitely looking forward to the 360 for style.  The round one is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to go to the screen.  There's some videos at the end of this presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's finish up with the L word and then we'll get to watches because that's a big thing too.  But I want to make sure we get all.  So Palette is, there's Material Designer, there's Palette.  That's the library that you're going to use.  Polymer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Polymer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  Polymer.  What's Palette?  There's another thing called Palette.  Palette was something they announced last year.  Polymer.  So it's not just for Android.  I can use it with my web design.  Right.  Yep.  So the UI can now look kind of unified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This to me was really crucial.  And you know, in my field we're starting to think about, oh, we're going to think about  digital, about mobile.  What's really happening there at Google is that they're designing to mobile first.  And then by the way, you can then adapt that to the web.  You can put things on the web.  I think that's really, really, really critical.  They're proud of the web browser.  They're proud of the browser.  But when they talked about Chrome, they talked about mobile Chrome.  Right.  They talked about integrating mobile Chrome.  When they talked about Chrome, otherwise they talked about the Chromebook.  They weren't talking about the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and in fact, it was pretty apparent throughout all of this keynote that the hub for all of  this is the phone.  Yes.  And then you have the phone, you have TVs, you have laptops, you have tablets.  But the phone is now, we used to think of the PC as the hub.  The phone is the hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think what that changes, the crucial phrase to me the entire morning was a computer  is now small enough to wear on your body all day.  Yeah.  So they're looking at this as a computer.  This is a computer, is your computer for now, and it connects to this.  I think in the long run, this will be your primary computer.  And there'll be integrated display devices separately from that.  And this is your authentication.  This is your communication.  This is everything.  You might need a bigger antenna.  Fine, you have this nearby.  You might need a bigger display.  You have this nearby.  But your computer and your identity is going to be in this eventually, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So Polymer is this cross-platform library.  It's not the first time they've talked about it.  They actually did talk about it last year.  Web components usher in a new era of web development based on encapsulated, interoperable custom  elements that extend HTML.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  This is basically a kit for you to build your apps across all platforms.  It's a library.  It's a library.  And this is basically, I think we've talked about Bootstrap from Twitter.  This is similar to Bootstrap, but it sounds like this is even more, even more so.  And you develop, okay.  You get a bunch of UI elements for free.  That's nice.  And then you have this page.  It's polymerproject.org.  You'll see even there's buttons.  When you hover over them, they have certain effects.  They actually do.  They have the material design effects.  The thing.  So you'll be able to implement those things in your app very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the more they do that, the more number of people can make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Then you can concentrate on your content in your app versus having to style your buttons,  basically.  So you get a lot of things for free as a developer.  It's interesting that they've got this code here on GitHub and not Google code.  Also, if you play for, they know that's where they're going to where the developers are  rather than asking developers to come to them.  And yeah, I'm excited about this.  I'm definitely going to play around with this.  Look at this playground.  This is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's BSD license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, a little WYSIWYG action going on there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can drag it in and you can change the skin and the content and the code.  And here's a map.  These are all little widgets.  Here's a smoothie chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a speech mic.  I like this idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put a little mic there that you can click.  So all of these things.  There's the smoothie chart.  There's the smoothie chart.  There's the mic.  This is kind of cool.  And this is actually web based, which really shows the power of the browser these days.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  So Palette, Polymer, the L release.  Oh, Project Volta.  This is interesting.  That was interesting too.  You know, one of the things Apple got a lot of attention for in iOS 8 is finally they're  going to break down battery use by app.  Google one up them on that.  Battery use.  Hell, we're going to show you wake states, wake locks.  We're going to give basically we're going to instrument instrument everything and you're  going to be able as developer to see what everything's doing.  That also worked to shame developers too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, the user.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is when the protester kind of started.  We didn't really hear it.  This is when the battery stuff kind of got.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the protester, there were two protesters, by the way, like to point out that the gender  distribution among protesters was 50 percent women.  So that's nice.  They're getting some diversity in the protest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better percentage than Google got in attendees, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twenty percent, twenty eight percent women attendees, but 50 percent protesters.  So there's that.  The protester.  One of the protests, the second protesters was saying you are all working for a company  that makes robots that kill people.  Makes robots that kill people.  Does Google have robots that kill people?  Should I be worried?  Actually, they bought that Boston company that makes the killer robots.  Are they killer robots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't make drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I guess the first one was protesting.  One of Google's lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, robots don't kill people.  Algorithms kill people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, not a surprise.  In fact, we'd heard that.  And I don't know if you saw this, that some of the protesters would be dressed as storm  troopers outside of Moscone Center.  Did you see some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I did see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This town is just getting ridiculous.  Not this town.  This is Petaluma.  Petaluma is fine.  That town is getting ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone on Twitter said that how should we trust Google with our data if they can't even  keep somebody out of the keynote?  It was interesting.  Security did not react.  I mean, the protestor was talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a security person standing in every single row and they didn't twitch a muscle  when this happened.  The blue shirts.  So finally.  Were they just stunned?  The white shirts were not authorized to do this.  The blue shirts came in.  Finally, they talked to each other.  They didn't know what to do.  You don't just do what you do.  Your security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they did, in fact, escort them gently out.  I'm told they did not tackle them.  They didn't tase them.  No, there was no drama.  They escorted them out.  Well, at first you thought, oh, is this part of the presentation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the fact that nobody moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody did anything.  Paralyzed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google is famous for its police department.  Right?  That they have this whole division that's security and police.  And when they come to your house.  Well, when Kevin Rose's protesters were out, he said, well, no, I just called the Google  police.  And they handled it.  I called the Google police.  And I went, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google police were asleep today.  They have a boy with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scary.  But I'm glad to hear they're not.  All right.  Let's talk about Google Wear because that was Android Wear.  That was the next topic.  They did demonstrate the LG G Watch, which looked pretty cool.  It did.  I don't want square.  I'm with you.  I want round.  I don't care if it's big round.  Yeah.  I don't care if it's Flava Flav round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Small square.  Will that work?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not just so it's the shape, not just the size.  Well, I'm wearing a rectangular watch, but I feel like it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You actually are.  Yeah.  It just looks.  It looks too much like the Casio watch.  The bezel is big and it just doesn't feel style.  It doesn't feel.  It feels like a computer on your wrist.  Right?  I don't want it to be a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's still the design.  The design worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The demonstration.  It looked OK.  It did.  It was very much what we'd seen already in the videos that they showed at the last mention  of Android Wear.  Where was that?  That we saw that.  I can't remember.  But they have basically Google Now cards.  In fact, that is another takeaway, the cardification of everything.  Those cards are now on Chrome.  The browser, when you look at recents on Chrome, it's cards.  This is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And very much a part of material design.  That those cards should act like card stock, float and shuffle and move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one interesting thing about this too, which I think was hidden and important, is  they're prioritizing the cards.  They're prioritizing your notifications.  All your notifications.  So they're recognizing what's most important.  And I've talked on this show in the past, among all the more boring moments, Marissa  Meyer talking years ago about the notion of a hyper personal news stream.  Oh yeah.  That Google will prioritize what you do.  And actually, I think we saw the start of that today.  In terms of which cards show up and when.  Yes.  And knowing that this is a reason to interrupt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The watch will know where you are.  It'll know if you're late for your flight.  It'll know that you walked into the airport.  It'll show your QR code.  This is something the phone's done all along.  But it's a little more useful.  The phone is in my pocket.  I don't see it doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The watch is much more like that.  Well, the number, I forget what it was, 125 times a day we check our phones.  Yes.  That was the number they gave.  And so now if it's always on, it's always there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About eight times an hour if you're up all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is, I was teasing Ron last night.  He installed an app that monitors his cell phone addiction.  It had tracked that he had unlocked his phone 110 times in 24 hours.  And I looked at him and said, I'm judging you.  That's a lot.  And then I heard that number today.  Apparently it's low.  It's low.  Hello.  One thing that we forgot about L is some of the notification changes.  Not to rewind, but your notifications now will be in your lock screen in L, which is  really nice.  And looking like a card.  You can swipe them away.  Looking hard, liking, swipe them away.  And L will run exclusively on ART as well.  So it'll be a lot faster.  Instead of Dalvik.  Oh yeah, we didn't mention ART.  Yeah, we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Dalvik, which is the just-in-time Java compiler.  Runtime.  Runtime, I should say, that is used currently on Android.  We saw ART when KitKat first came out.  You can turn on your developer preferences and go in there and switch to ART.  It had to recompile all the apps.  So it was a fairly long switchover.  It didn't work.  You said you had problems with one app, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ron actually switched over to ART and crashed his whole machine.  It's because WhatsApp actually wasn't compatible with ART, which I'm sure it is now.  But L is exclusively on ART, which just means it's a lot faster, a lot smoother.  And developers don't have to change anything in their apps to get that speed increase.  They said two times speed increase over Dalvik.  Better garbage collector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't notice that with the pre-release ART.  I didn't notice any increase at all.  And I have been using ART.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, because you switched over.  I did.  And you've been there since.  You've been Artified ever since.  Artified ever since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you go ART, you don't ever go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's fully, that 64-bit compatibility, which just means increased memory space.  You just get a lot more memory and speed for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dalvik is a just-in-time compiler, which means it doesn't...  So the way all of these work is that the code sits there, but right before it's used, it's turned into a machine code.  Or maybe just the Java.  No, I guess the machine.  I don't know.  Turn it into something that the machine could run.  ART is an ahead-of-time compiler.  So presumably goes through the apps and kind of pre-compiles the apps.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because when you compile a Java app, you actually get bytecode versus machine language.  That's why you have a Java runtime that then translates it into machine code.  And so, right, ART is just doing that faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it takes the non-machine-specific dex code and turns it into machine-specific code that can be run instantly.  Right, on your device.  Presumably, things would go faster when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I didn't mean to take us out of anywhere there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ART has better garbage collection, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better garbage collection.  I'm all about better garbage collectors.  I know everybody's on the edge of their seat hoping that they were going to get better garbage collectors today.  And we did. We got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it not only is a garbage collector, but apparently it's going to be a garbage compactor.  And I always wanted one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like my garbage compacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There will be garbage compaction.  I'm reading the thing.  I'm not making this stuff up.  Anyway, ART is going to be on L.  Compost code.  Yeah.  Compost code.  It's recycling, not throwing out your bad memory pointers.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, sorry, so let's go back to Android Wear.  No, I want to make sure we get everything in the L release in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, else.  So we, okay.  Android Wear. Let's talk about Wear.  Let's go back to Android Wear. Yeah.  All right.  There is an SDK available today.  That's a pre-release? Or is it the final SDK?  I think it's pre-release.  The final...  Man, they're close because we're already seeing two watches.  They're close, right, because we got two watches.  Yeah.  So maybe it's final.  So what did they show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed step-by-step instructions for all the cooks.  So if you're cooking and you got your watch on, you can swipe through and look at the stuff that you're working on, which is nice.  I've had, I've definitely splashed some tomato sauce on my iPad and had my phone lock when my hands were wet while I was cooking.  Order a pizza from E24 right from your watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coincidentally, you can order the pizza and spill the tomato sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the pizza cook uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had, hey Google, order me a car.  Right.  Lift, just knows where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remind me of, wake me up tomorrow, a lot of voice.  Again, back to the cards being prioritized so you can watch.  The key to me is that this is now completely obsolete.  Because I've always said...  He's pointing to his Google Glass.  This has three functions.  The Google Glass, the one thing that's not obsolete so far is being able to take a picture of what you see when you see it and share it.  The two things that are obsolete are alerts and instructions.  And the watch takes that over and does a better job of it.  I can just get a glance of whatever alerts I have.  I do not want the alerts coming in here.  I've learned that.  It doesn't prioritize well enough.  It can't figure it out.  It's worthless.  And in terms of instructions, if I'm in the car and I'm driving, I'm going to use my actual phone as my GPS.  If I'm walking, this is kind of dumb, and I'm going to walk into a post, turn left, Jeff, on the watch works well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big use case you're missing though, going from the Glass to the watch is hands-free video and taking pictures.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the thing that stays with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not necessarily.  The Samsung Gear 2 has a camera.  You could say take a picture.  It's actually a pretty good camera.  It's no more ridiculous than using your glass.  This is the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina is looking at Etta doing something.  Hey, Etta, do that again.  It's not quite the hands-free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the GoPro shows that there's a particular use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glass becomes, there's a camera that'll be here, number one.  Number two, it will have an indicator on to know when it's on to get rid of all this privacy whining.  And then number three, it'll be a hell of a lot smaller and you'll be able to communicate with your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I went zip lining with the Gear 2 watch.  I had a GoPro, and you're right for the video and so forth, the GoPro.  But just having the, you can't really carry a camera when you're zip lining because your hands are busy.  These are not bad pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In my case, my hands would be so sweaty that the camera would drop.  Those are quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are much better than I would have expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually somewhat pleased.  I thought they came out quite well.  So, okay, so that's, by the way, there's no reason to say that an Android Wear watch wouldn't have a camera built into it.  That's true.  So maybe you'll keep the glass so you can take pictures of Etta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta go visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta go visit Etta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just don't get that blink to take a picture or just take a video now.  That's what gets people into trouble with glass.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  And that's really not something you want to do.  You don't want to do that unless you're on a zip line or your daughter's about to take her first steps.  They're kind of special situations.  It needs to be in a certain place, not a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, back to the L word.  I'm sorry, one more thing.  I just noticed somebody tweeted me.  The guy who wrote the Google Developers blog on material is Nicholas Jitkoff.  Alcor, the guy who did Quicksilver for the Macintosh and disappeared from the Quicksilver.  Alcor is at Google.  We knew he got a job at Google and now we know what he's been working on, which is material design.  So that's pretty cool.  That is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still use and love Quicksilver.  I do too.  Very well designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do too.  And he has a pretty good post about material design, what it means and how it integrates with Polymer, the toolkit for the web,  which basically gives you access to material design in WebRather.  So sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So back to the wearables.  I think another important thing about wearables is context and how the wearable both senses it and creates it.  It creates context in the sense that when I'm wearing my watch and I'm holding my phone, my phone says I'm okay to be unlocked now.  Hallelujah.  I did like that.  That's a nice one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take it from the Moto X, which senses Bluetooth pairings and will unlock if you're in a secure Bluetooth.  And I sense there's a whole list of contexts that work both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My watch will know where I am.  I'm near a port.  I've got to tell you to get on the flight.  I'll prioritize that card.  Or my watch creates the context of saying, Jeff's near here because it's his watch.  This is great.  And this is something we've already seen nibbling the edges around Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It knows when you're home.  It knows when you're at work.  There's a program we've recommended called Agent does the same thing on any Android device.  It makes sense when you're at the store.  Reminders have always popped up saying, don't forget to buy milk.  But it makes sense to watch.  This is a better place to put it is on your wrist.  Yeah.  So this becomes your authentication in the future, I think, which is important.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that for all these kinds of things, for walking into your house, for getting your devices, for billing, for the security, for the security.  For billing things, if you're wearing it, presumptively, you're less likely to lose it.  And by the way, if you lose this, if these two things aren't near each other, your phone or phone or watch, then each is going to say, oh, I'm lonely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to work right now.  The Gear 2 does that as well.  It not only notifies you when you leave, but you can search for your phone by pressing a button on your watch and the phone will beep or pressing a button on the phone and the watch will beep.  So again, I feel like Samsung is kind of with a second generation watch kind of seeing the opportunities.  And these are obvious opportunities to anybody who's making these devices.  It makes sense that it should be in an API for Android Wear.  We still haven't answered the question of which you should get the gear.  No, we haven't.  So the Samsung, what's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gear Live.  Gear Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, my take on it was I want the one that's more stylish because maybe I'm just vain.  And to me, that's the G Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you look at people's wrists carefully as they were on stage?  Because I think every one of those watches was represented on stage.  Well, Sundar was wearing the round one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sundar actually looked big on him.  I mean, it looked like a chunky watch on him.  I don't mind chunky watches so much.  It definitely made me want the Moto the most.  But between the G Watch and the Gear Live, I like the way the G Watch looks a little better.  But I also like that Samsung has some experience with watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So CNET has a preview up of the Gear Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, let me find that because Samsung doesn't have any information up.  This looks a little bit nicer, frankly.  It has a heart rate monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cool thing about this one is the heart rate monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to tell you, don't get overexcited because these heart rate monitors on wristwatches have a basis in the gear too.  Sorry, a Best Buy ad before we get to the review.  But they don't work when you're moving, for one thing.  So they're not really ideal for exercising.  That didn't work well for me because I'm stationary most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. If you're sitting around, they're the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, the Gear 2 does it and so does the Basis Watch.  And they're accurate in the right circumstances.  Don't get too sweaty. Don't move around too much.  They don't work very well then.  But I do think these replace the Fitbit and the Fuel Band and all of these simple pedometers.  So here is the Scott Stein, a senior editor, and that is the Samsung Gear Live.  Looks, I have to say, almost identical, minus the camera and the button to the Gear 2.  It does.  Read messages, respond by voice. You can do that on the Gear 2.  They are big.  They're big. But you want a big screen because you want to be able to read it.  That's true too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the recharging situation on these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you on the Gear 2 that you have to dock it.  And I think it's going to be the same here.  This looks on the back identical.  How do you dock it?  Well, I'll show you. See, look at when he shows you the back.  You see there's contacts here. There's four contacts.  This is just like the Gear 2. It's not too big.  A little dock that slips onto it and then that has the USB port.  Just put a USB port in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did say wireless charging, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be wireless. It should be wireless.  I don't think it should make a watch with a dock or USB port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wear my watch at night so I can see what time it is because I'm blind.  If I have to take my watch off every night to charge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're going to have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want to use it as an alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, let's look at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, you tell your phone to be an alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, the phone has to be an alarm. I dock my phone right next to my bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I think the LG is the one I would get.  Really? Yeah.  You're going to get the Moto, right?  Just because...  LG at least has a page up. Let's see if we can find out more about the G Watch.  Choice of colors in black, Titan or white gold.  You can customize the strap. Boy, that's big.  I mean, I think from a distance they look identical.  400 milliamp hour battery.  It says it will go all day on a single charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a Luigi moment here.  It's like the...  It's a computer on your wrist.  And it's going 600 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And there's a toilet.  So that's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is. Come on, this is pretty damn amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, it is. It's pretty amazing.  This will work. The G Watch, and I'm sure this is true of the Samsung, but I can't promise you,  but the LG will work with any smartphone running Android 4.3 or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, 4.3 is a recent...  Well, 4.4 is the current, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 4.4 just came down on ours, yeah.  KitKat's current. But 4.3, Jelly Bean.  Jelly Bean, okay.  That's not the most recent, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you right? I was having a Luigi.  It doesn't have wires charging, it's crap.  What do you mean? I have to plug it in.  You have to plug it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to G...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when you had to wind them?  Did it change the date in them, in the little tiny thing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew somebody who used to have...  In fact, I have quite a few of these.  These are called automatic watches that wind as you walk.  And he had a device, because if you didn't walk enough,  he'd had a device, you put the watch on it,  it spins it around in a weird way and winds it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like as if it were your gate?  Yeah. That's lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the rationale is that if you're a collector...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here...  This is a little recursive.  I went to g.co slash wear check to see if my phone is compatible with Android Wear,  and it refers me to g.co slash wear check.  So maybe the page isn't done yet. I don't know.  Anyway.  This basically combines the features of the Pebble with a fitness band of some kind,  Google Now notifications. I think this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they all have the fitness stuff? They all have the same sensors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine. I mean, those are easy to implement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The heart rate is not so easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a little star. Heart rate only available on watches with heart rate monitors.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting. I wonder what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Now, they're also going to...  This is a good page if you go to android.com,  because it really demonstrates what the future of Android is,  powering screens of all sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It was Android on every screen. We felt like the thesis today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the future. Android Wear on your watch.  And everywhere in the world.  Android TV. Android Auto.  Car.  Yeah. So Android is the future. And that makes sense.  When Andy Rubin left to go run robots at Google, and Sundar Pichai took over,  he's the Chrome guy, the Chrome OS guy.  All of a sudden, we suspect maybe this means there's going to be some sort of unification,  and I think that's what's happened to Android everywhere.  And that makes sense from Google's point of view. They've got a great product.  And they want the next billion people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I think that they have a shot at getting the next billion people online with Android.  Especially with the phone that costs less than $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Auto, I don't know how much there is to say about Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a casting thing, which is also what Apple's CarPlay is.  Auto does not have Android built into the Auto anymore that has iOS built into the Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I prefer, because I don't want to have to say, I don't want to buy this car,  because literally, if a car came only with iOS, I wouldn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in five years, you don't want to be looking at your car saying,  gee, you're still KitKat, I wish you were the L word.  I say that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The W word at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The W, right. Who knows what Desert will be at by then.  But the way they demoed it with that cut down Kia Soul was cable.  And I think that makes sense. You cannot get a full screen like this fast enough with Bluetooth.  So you're going to have to connect a special cable, so your car will have to have it.  They did say that there are a lot of cars in this alliance.  A lot of manufacturers. Surprisingly, no Toyota.  Yeah, I thought that was odd. Did you see Honda? I didn't see Honda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go scroll on the page, it says, yes, Honda's there.  Honda's there. In fact, here's the list.  Wait, wait, wait. Abarth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Abarth. I love the Abarth.  It has a Scorpion for the logo, so that's got to be good.  Bentley too, so you've got to be happy about that.  Alfa Romeo, Acura, Audi, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge.  Tesla, folks. No, Tesla.  Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jeep, Kia, Maserati, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're still Opels.  You're filled with GM in Europe.  My first car was an Opel Cadet.  Really? You're a dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ram, Renault, Seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seat.  I'm sorry, Seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen, and Volvo.  So what's missing from that?  Well, as you said, Toyota's the big one. Tesla's not the trigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honda's there. Tesla's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but GM in the guise of Chevrolet.  But not other... Well, I guess it was Chrysler. All right.  So GM and Ford, they got the big three US automakers.  They've got Volkswagen, Audi. That's good.  So in other words, big. I don't see Peugeot or Renault.  Wow, there's Renault.  Citroen.  I want a deux cheveux with Android Auto.  But I think I like the idea.  Now, Kevin Marx was unhappy with the screen.  He said, why would they waste space at the bottom of the screen for those icons?  On a 16.9 screen, they should put them on the left.  I think that's pretty standard.  I think that's what people expect in a car.  And remember, you're listening to the directions, not watching them on the screen.  Right.  There was a lot more touching than I would have liked.  On the music, there was far more touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to get a lot of torture out there because now we have the feds wanting to regulate phone GPS.  So they're going to come into this too, and they're going to regulate anything you do in a car that touches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have to say, I at least on my phones, I'm able to use Google Speech to say, listen to Lana Del Rey and it will play music.  I could say launch Audible.  It will launch the Audible app.  I think most of what we do can be done by voice.  Yeah.  I think.  Until you're in the app.  Yeah, once you're in the app, you can't navigate it.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have written the directions app and messaging apps to be able to work.  So that'll be the next phase, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And some big app partners, Spotify, Stitcher, Omano, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Songza, Major League Baseball.  So they've got app partners.  And in the demo, he did the, OK, Google, what time is the museum open till?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then Google responded.  And then he said, well, can you take me there?  Navigate to there.  So you have that conversational Google search, voice search going on, which I was like, OK, I was impressed by that.  They also showed that on the watch, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could actually use the watch to steer around.  Anyway, this makes sense.  And that's I guess what Google's saying is we're agnostic.  You could have Android everywhere.  Yes.  You can wear it.  You can put it on your TV.  Let's talk a little bit about the TV.  I wasn't exactly sure how this worked.  I'm not either.  I gathered that Sony and Sharp will announce 4K TVs later this year that will have Android TV built in.  But more importantly, I got the sense will work with Chromecast.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, you can cast from anything that's cast compatible.  So any tab on your computer or any app on your phone that has the cast button will cast to Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They separated Google Cast from Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could even cast my entire Android interface.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  You can cast your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's to Chromecast.  There's a separation here between Android TV and Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google Cast is the casting technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Google Cast is the technology.  Right.  But to say that something's at Google, I think they use the term cast-ready apps,  I think just means that you can stream out the media to either Chromecast but also Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also looked like they were going to have a lean or we're going to encourage a lean back experience for apps  so that if I cast the app to a 10-foot screen, 10 feet away, it would have a lean back interface.  So right now, the way Chromecast works, the interface is always on the phone, on the tablet  but it's not on the screen.  The screen just gets the content.  It looks like I will be able to control the screen from the phone and have an interface.  So I could search Netflix on the screen but use the phone.  I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not clear.  Tell me if I'm wrong, but this is important.  They did not make a box.  They did not make a round globe.  So that means they have a very limited installed pool of two manufacturers, both Japanese, not Koreans, by the way,  who are the big ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're not going to see Samsung because they have their own platform, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, ah, this is the one that underwhelms me most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google struggled in TV.  They did the Google TV, which was arguably a flop, even though LG adopted it, a Korean company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now they're going to do the same thing.  Now they have to have the manufacturers.  And so if I want it tomorrow across all my TVs in my house and I have many, I can do it.  I don't think that's the play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a possible one, but I think Chromecast is the play.  And if they can use Chromecast to control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all that functionality, Leo, I'm not so sure.  All that functionality they showed you, I don't think came with Chromecast.  All that lean back and control the TV and do all the search and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The search interface and the.  Is that Chromecast?  No, no, no, that's not.  No, that's not.  I felt like that was unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  But you were sitting in the room and you.  It was unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right.  This, they kind of breezed over.  Chromecast was a whole separate thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was for a Google TV, an Android TV rather.  Yeah, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my question mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't understand exactly what did what.  But I think that's the case.  So they they hope obviously to get manufacturers to adopt this, build it in the set top boxes.  Right.  Build it into TVs.  But that's a big gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now once you're there, the interface was fascinating too, because it really brought search.  And I don't want to necessarily look for just give me the Academy Award winning movies in 2012.  I could care less.  But the fact that I can browse through choices rather than through schedules.  That I can ask for a show and get a show.  That's a search motif brought to entertainment.  That's important.  But not if you don't have an installed base.  It's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and furthermore, when he did the search, he searched for Breaking Bad, which I know  is available on Netflix, Amazon, and it only showed Google Play Store.  Right.  I do hope that that search will not be cross provider.  Well, I mean, I hope it is not.  Amazon Fires is not, by the way.  The Fire TV, when you do a search, it shows it on Amazon and not anywhere else.  And that's really what we want, isn't it?  Is it a cross content provider search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they said there would show anything you have installed.  Okay.  That would be good.  So if you had Netflix installed and it was available there, I think they said.  Does that sound familiar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would Netflix have to expose that to them?  Like, is it possible that Netflix would have to expose their content?  I would expect it.  How would you search it otherwise?  Right.  How would you search it otherwise?  Right.  There are several things.  Tivo does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I search under my Tivo, it does it across Hulu Plus, Amazon, Netflix, and it  will show, and my Xfinity On Demand, as a matter of fact, and it will show where those  shows live on all of those platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like that's the only reasonable answer.  That's what you want.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at the developer's page, designing for TV, smart TVs powered by Android.  Okay.  So that tells you that that is something you're going to build in.  Bring your favorite Android apps to the best screen in your house.  Thousands of apps are already optimized for TVs.  This is how Google TV works.  You'd install an app on that was for Google TV on the TV.  And then for developers, how to optimize your layouts for a TV screen.  I did love it that when he was showing the Android device, it showed it in portrait mode,  and then he turned the phone to show a dark sky or whatever, and it went to widescreen.  Yeah.  That was nice.  That's what it should do, and that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the SDK provides fragments, which is Android-speak, developer-speak for UI elements that would  make your app sort of TV compatible.  So it sounds like this preview SDK lets you provide layouts for the TV if someone puts  your app on the TV, and also expose your content to the search results as well.  Okay.  So you can do that.  Yeah.  So yeah, help users find your content quickly with in-app searching.  Great.  So in-app searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's nice.  He was using a game controller on the TV.  That's also built into Android TV as a support for game controllers.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Twitter, Ben Swan says that Asus and Razer are making Android TV set-top boxes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did mention Razer.  Asus is something.  So the API comes out, or the SDK comes out tomorrow if you want to start developing for  TV.  And I would hope we get some clarification maybe on Google blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this point, developers have to feel sort of burned by the original Google TV.  Well, I mean the Q.  Q.  The Q we never really had a chance to develop for.  Chromecast.  Chromecast has been a success.  But it's been a slow, apps have been adding Chromecast support slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd love to see this capability through the Chromecast.  Because that would basically enable any TV to do it.  It's a better way to do it.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If all this functionality was built into existing Chromecast devices.  Yeah, now it's true.  It's true.  I'd love to see that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sarah Perez writing at TechCrunch says that this will update to the Chromecast, will introduce  an AirPlay-like Android mirroring feature photo backdrops.  I liked those.  Yeah, that was really nice.  You can have your weather now.  You can have a variety of photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So this is Chromecast specific update.  The nice thing about the marriage between Android TV and Chromecast, and they made this  point, as Chromecast gets better, as casting gets better, as they get better at memory  and speeding it up, that will also improve Android TV, which is nice.  The Chromecast updates were awesome.  So you can put your own pictures as the backdrop is really nice.  You can mirror your screen, which is also really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that you don't have to be on the same Wi-Fi network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's going to mediate that, which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My dream, right off the bat, is every hotel room in America, in the world, should have  a Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  You walk in the room and you just send whatever's on your...  And I don't have to be on the hotel network at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was one of the reasons you didn't bring your Chromecast around.  You couldn't do it because the Wi-Fi would be all...  But you don't need to anymore.  Bring your Chromecast with you.  If you can plug in at any HDMI port, you can now use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Google would be very smart to do a deal with the hotel chain.  They don't need to.  Because Chromecast is so big.  Bring your Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff is saying that every TV should have it plugged in and have it already.  It should, but you don't have to.  You don't have to just bring your Chromecast.  Yeah, it's like throw it in the air.  35 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does this remind you of?  This immediately made me think about the Nexus Q. This felt like echoes of the Q. Remember  that feature with Q where if your friends came over and they had their Android devices,  they also could send their playlist to the Q. It's this idea of social flinging.  Right.  Social flinging.  Social flinging.  It's what monkeys do.  Right, yeah.  Social, digital flinging.  And so I was like, oh, right.  Okay, the Q kind of lives on a little bit in the Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was a really good point you made in Twitter, Gina, that you see the antecedents...  The antecedents is the opposite.  The descendants of the dead beasts come back alive in the best ideas.  And they really do use them.  Things from Wave, things from Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Drive has so many Wave things.  You see this social thing from Q. You saw so many things that failed in Buzz have showed  up in Google+, although I admit that Google Plus hasn't been the most successful or it  certainly didn't have the spotlight today.  But yeah, Google's failures are public, but they obviously inform the next generation.  I saw a lot of folks kind of snarking on Twitter.  It was like, oh, what about Glass?  What about Google Plus?  And everything they talked about last year doesn't exist this year.  And I think that sort of the ghosts of the old stuff that didn't work, I think, really  inform the new work.  I like that.  It's messy.  It's evolution versus the big reveal of the perfectly polished product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is how the real world works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're going to get a better product if you try it in a variety of ways.  At least Google continues to try it.  It's a startup world.  Startups fail.  Things fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a company of many startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're not embarrassed to say, hey, we're never going to sell the Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's all forgiven when you have cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love cardboard.  Do you think this is a little bit of a knock on the Oculus Rift?  The fact that, hey, we're going to give you some cardboard.  You put your phone in here and it does exactly the same thing, only better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that, it's also a knock on Amazon because who needs 3D in your phone?  They're right.  There is a little bit of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It contains magnets.  Why are magnets there?  There's a magnet over here.  We're not clear on why that magnet is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It must anchor the phone where it's at.  It must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A rubber band, the magnet, and some glue, and some Velcro, and lenses.  It's a strange thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where you stick it for.  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  So weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad to have one.  Actually, thank you for bringing it.  Sure.  Yeah.  I should check eBay because I'm wondering if these are...  I checked a minute ago.  Did you check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was beginning the show.  Let's just see if it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you searching for, cardboard?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google cardboard, right?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was chatting with a Googler a little bit last night and was saying that there's still  these two product lines, the Chrome line and the Android line, that still exist.  And I think that it couldn't be a source of confusion, if not for consumers and certainly  for developers.  You have the two open source platforms that still seem to be hooked into one another,  but solving the same problems and what's going on.  And he said, I think the idea was that one of them would really succeed and the other  wouldn't, but it turned out that they both really succeeded.  So we're keeping them around and we know it's a potential source of confusion, but they're  both doing so well and solving problems.  So now I think today what we saw, I think another takeaway from today was this marriage  between I think Chrome and Android are starting to come together.  They really can be.  I mean, Android is not a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chrome is a browser.  Now, the other thing we didn't talk about before, the fact that in your recents on the  phone, it mixes in web pages and applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A tab is considered a singular activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in search, you can go in and one of the results in the search can be an app that you  happen to have.  So apps are Android, Chrome is the web, and they are now starting to mix in.  So this whole idea that in my world of media is, well, the web's dead and we're all going  to have apps.  The only downloads and runs the apps were all the web.  In Google, they're mixed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you think of and did you understand the Chromebook integration with Android?  Tell me, I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You laughed when I sat down on my Chromebook.  That was nutty.  So we were exhausted at that point.  It was really pretty late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand.  They were running Android apps.  You were really keyed into this.  Yes, I was.  Jeff was like so excited next to me.  I could feel his excitement.  This could be huge.  I understand it.  So they're running Android apps?  They're running Android apps on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now mind you, I already have Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a Chrome extension?  So he showed Evernote.  He had Evernote on his phone.  And it was somehow on his...  Now is that because he installed it as a Chrome extension?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there must be some kind of runtime Android on here that makes it run.  But what it means is that I can put, again, the phone becomes the center of everything.  So I can show on the TV or on my laptop Android.  If I have an app that I like and I like the way it operates, I can now run it on my Chromebook.  Now it's Chromebook.  It's not Chrome.  It's not other operating systems.  It's just this operating system.  But they're probably proud of the Chromebook success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he showed Vine, which is not available on the Chromebook.  Right.  Right.  And it looked like it was the Vine.  It was the aspect ratio of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wondering about, can I finally get Microsoft to your phone service, Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skype 2 would be one of them.  Do you have to go to the Chrome store and install?  We're clear about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they said that it's still early days.  And of course, the Pixel, I think, is the only touchscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  There are other touchscreens.  There are.  There are.  We talked about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could use the trackpad to do touch.  Yes.  It would work.  They showed Flipboard, which is also not on Chrome, I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flipboard, Evernote, and Vine, they showed.  It can show in a kind of tall, phone-shaped size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so what this does, it strengthens Chrome because you can get tons more apps on Chrome  now.  It strengthens the link between Android and Chrome, which was my point earlier, that they're  really becoming much better integrated.  And it says that mobile is preeminent Uber-Alice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're not at all clear about the mechanics, but am I gathering that the idea is you will  then see an app in the Chrome?  I don't understand.  I don't understand.  Yeah, I don't understand either, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will there be a separate app store for Chromebooks that is Android apps?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Will...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Because it said some of your favorite apps.  So it didn't say all apps will suddenly run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do have to love the idea that you can unlock the Chromebook by getting near it with  Android.  Yeah, that's cool.  Because typing in my 820 character...  No, it's 32 character Google password every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always get frustrated on my phone too when I want to get to my cards.  I've got it, right?  So the fact that they're thinking that way...  I think the authentication stuff, they didn't push enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS will also show notifications from your phone.  But we use Push Bullet, something you recommended and I really like.  Yeah, I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was one point where Vagai said, oh yeah, I got a notification on my Chrome OS that  my battery was running low.  It was such a delightful experience.  And I turned to Jeff and said, that's never a delightful experience.  It's never delightful to hear that your battery is running out.  I don't like...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Chrome extension that allows for the downloading of Android apps.  It says Android Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looked like it was running in a Hangouts-like window on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now, Chromebooks are Intel, right?  Or are they Android?  Or are they ARM?  Are they ARM or are they Intel?  That's an Intel device, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Intel.  There was a little robot dressed in an Intel app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the apps are going to have to run in a virtual machine because these are ARM apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just referred to something, a geeky way to do it, in 2012.  Oh.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're talking about Bluestacks, probably.  But we can do that.  Bluestacks is an emulator.  Bluestacks lets you run Android apps on Windows or Mac.  It's going to be something like Bluestacks, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless it's casting from your phone, which it's not.  It wasn't mirroring.  It was running.  It was running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was an odd thing to spend time on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they made a version of ART that ran on Intel, ART's the runtime, right?  Then you could take an APK and just run it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well...  Except for different calls.  Right.  You need the Android layer.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's going to have to be a wine-like layer of Android calls, otherwise it wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jason Howell, during the keynote, was saying, Android laptop?  And he's like, oh, this is basically it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but with all the benefits of a Chromebook.  Right.  Right.  Which are many, by the way.  I know.  I've come around, you know.  I know.  For education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've focused that crow well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anywhere you don't want to have your user be able to do anything, a Chromebook is an  excellent choice.  I do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm more than a year now.  Yeah, with great struggle.  More than...  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you still using Cronut?  No, I give up.  What is it called?  Not Cronut.  No, it's Crouton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crouton.  No, because I couldn't get Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No Netflix on Crouton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now on Chrome, you can download movies and shows.  Yeah, no, it's a beauty.  More than a year.  This has been my machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that they use the Amazon sales rankings as their sort of pride around  things.  They said the Chromebooks represent the top 10.  Top 10.  Yeah, the top 10 highest rated laptops on Amazon.  And there was a lot of that, right?  They talked about the Twitter DevRel group gave them access to the streaming API for  them to show the Google Cloud live stuff.  There was a few mentions of Samsung contributing their NOX stuff to Android L. There was the  mention of Amazon.  They were friendly.  They were very friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was peace right there.  Yeah, right.  But while we're talking about other companies, let us have a moment to curse Verizon.  Now what?  Because when people bought the...  Oh, this is a bad one.  And Google had to make this good.  Google had to make it good.  It wasn't Google's fault.  When I spent $1400 on my Pixel Chromebook, I got lifetime...  No, well, yeah, lifetime or two years.  I forget.  Two years.  Two years.  Data from Verizon.  100 megs a month, not much, but it was, you know, when you're in a pinch, you got it.  And then Verizon just started cutting it off in a year saying, F you to all of our customers  because that's what we do.  We're Verizon.  Wait a minute.  They just cut it off.  They said, we're not going to give you two years after all.  Yeah, they just started stopping it.  And customers didn't know.  And suddenly their year comes up because it's about now for a lot of people and they just  stop.  And so I know I'm shrieking.  What's wrong with that?  Well, a lot of things.  And so then Google is giving out $150 gift certificates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that's going to cost them like $1500.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean every single person who bought a Chromebook will get $150?  Only the Chromebook LTE.  Oh.  Like I said, it's going to cost thousands.  Thousands.  They're going to be out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking chops, as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, how many people do you think they have?  Not many.  Seriously.  But Verizon, what?  So how many?  Well, what's wrong with Verizon?  I agree.  Well, a lot.  That's not nice.  Not nice, Verizon.  They did bury a lot of nuggets.  And I have to say, I felt like there were crumbs.  Things like, well, we bought QuickOffice, so now you can use Google Docs and edit and  save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Native Office.  It was really a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They turned Microsoft into an API they just cut into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also said, now this was a little bit of a fudge.  They said $10 for unlimited data for Google Drive if you use Google Drive for Business.  What they didn't mention is that's only if five of you buy Google Drive for Business  at $10 each.  Oh really?  Otherwise, if just one of you buys it, it's just a terabyte.  But in fact, a terabyte is a lot.  A terabyte is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They certainly are and have been undercutting the prices for a month's story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was two angles in terms of going after the work audience.  One was being able to have a work partition on your phone.  That was the thanks to Knox by Samsung.  Right.  And then two was being able to use Docs.  They added functionality to Drive in terms of Office and more security and storage to  try to encourage more companies.  And the percentages, the number of colleges that have gone Google was really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was high.  The colleges and universities were the highest.  Really the highest by far.  Yeah, Fortune 500, colleges, universities and startups.  Now, if you had told me that, I would have said, well, obviously start most, you know,  the highest percentage of, you know, groups, those groups that have gone Google, I would  have said startups.  It wasn't.  It was universities.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, and then, uh, start-ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Colorado is Google.  It's Google.  Yeah.  We're trying to switch to CUNY.  Yeah.  Are you?  Well, my, my Sarah Bartlett, my dean growls at me every time she can't do, um, uh, edit  trace or redlining.  Well, she's going to be happy.  Redlining is going to be happy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, yeah, the college, there's a lot here that they, I mean, was fine, but they could  have cut.  They need a, they need a tougher editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They needed car, their cards to be prioritized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is, I think where the structure of Google really hurts them because they're trying to  keep everybody within an entrepreneurial spirit and the feeling of autonomy.  But then what happens, and you could see this, it must have happened, is that they are, the,  the call went out.  All right.  Who wants to present an IO?  Me, me, me.  Okay.  Who?  And then they did some sort of process.  Yeah.  And what they got was mud.  And we started on the list of what wasn't there though.  Well, number one, I didn't see any Google glass.  They saw glass holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots of people wearing glass.  Google is wearing glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although they did update glass today.  They have a new version of glass that has two gigabytes of Ram.  You're not going to get it.  I don't use 10 megabytes of my class because I don't use it.  But I found an explorer.  I feel well, you know what?  When you became an explorer, you understood.  This is a beta program.  This is not going to be the final.  So they've doubled the Ram and you're not going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you would, you know, so they just put them on sale in the UK.  Would you invest in it now when they didn't brag about it, when they didn't do anything about it?  No, no, no.  Sorry.  Nice people.  Nice, interesting technology.  A lot of things done.  I go back to what I said before.  Three functions that we kind of always said this.  I always said this.  I also said this is to the iPhone.  What this is.  This is whatever follows what the Newton was.  So Newton.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  12 new apps, including Shazam.  So you can say, OK, glass recognizes song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can pull out my phone and do it.  OK, glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A basketball training aid.  You need to get a specially equipped basketball and you throw it and then you get the little feedback after each shot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It went in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't go in.  I can tell that now.  It never goes in.  I have thrown it hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to make sure you get the arc.  The perfect arc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your release is poorly timed.  Swish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it will say swish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should put that sensor in a golf ball and it will smell.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should go for the golf ball crowd versus the basketball crowd.  They've got more money to spend on glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're more isolated on the golf course.  Nobody's going to see you look like a dork.  You already do look like a dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of glass holes wearing tasseled shoes and glass out there on the...  I can see it.  ... on the links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get driving directions for your cart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also nothing about Google+.  Let's stay there for a second.  Did last year they talk about Google+.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we were very excited.  I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Vic was talking.  Yeah, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We saw Bradley last time on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did events and there was a lot of...  Is that when they redesigned the app?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was not a word about it.  Not a syllable.  And I've been arguing that I'm one of the ones who holds out.  I still like Google+, and people make fun of me and all that.  But now I'm thinking...  We all still use it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say in the Brickhouse, it's our number one social network by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing I heard from somebody who talked to a Googler that they're going to start splitting up Google+.  This is fourth hand, so who knows?  But the argument is that if you look at what you can do with photos in Google+, it's incredible.  It is.  Nobody knows it because it's inside Google+.  It's buried.  I made this point on the show a couple of weeks ago.  Zuckerberg talking about breaking up the big blue app.  If you're using WhatsApp, use WhatsApp.  It's fine. I own it now.  He's not trying to integrate it into everything.  Google does not have one big portal app you use.  It has an underlying user database across a bunch of different functions.  So they broke that rule when it came to Google+.  I think Google+, is an underlying database of relationships that brings relevance to you across many different functions.  If you want to do photos now, then do a great photo function.  If you want to talk to people who are on Google+, go do that.  Right, right.  No, hangouts, go do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Photos and hangouts are great.  Those are the aspects of Google+, that I use every day.  I wouldn't say that I use Google+.  I mean, it's really kind of a marketing problem, right?  You say Google+, and people think you're talking about the social network.  But it's really an umbrella to a ton of different products.  Even just profiles and sign in to YouTube to comment, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just because they didn't mention it at a developer event does not mean they're not using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they know there's a Kremlinology, though.  They know that.  They mentioned Nexus phones. They didn't show any Nexus phones. They didn't develop any Nexus phones. They mentioned it.  They didn't mention Glass. They didn't mention Google+.  That's true. They didn't say Nexus.  We're the Kremlinologists.  Right.  Well...  So what else was not there?  What else was not there?  So Nexus, Voice, Google+, Hangouts, Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I just point out, last year, remember they did that great Search thing and Search for the Golden Gate Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were Search functions on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed the material design and the Search interface on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they didn't enhance the functionality of Search in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But they did do the museum and how do I get there.  So there was a reinforcement of the conversational Search.  Show them last year.  Really how Search is being used in a modern...  They showed links to your apps in Android.  So an OpenTable link would say open this app.  That's cool.  I actually really liked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I liked it too.  The process communication was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you search for the tour in Google Earth, if you search for something that you had done in an app and it said here's the tour...  That's true.  That was Search on the phone. That wasn't actually Google Search. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't mention ads in any way. Add words, add sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No phones or tablets. Nothing in terms of making them or anything new coming.  Right.  Which we've really been wondering about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no new Chromebooks or Chromeboxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, hardware was really scarce.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and all this talk yesterday... Well, part of the talk yesterday was that Nest is taking over much of the hardware.  Well, in fact...  Tony's going to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no mention of Nexus phones or tablets.  Nest. Or Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Nest even.  Or Nest. Yeah.  And even, you know, they have a home thing.  When Nest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some examples about Nest.  When Google bought Dropcam, really it was Nest that bought Dropcam.  And that's how it was pitched, even though Nest is a wholly owned subsidiary of Google.  So maybe that's interesting. Tony Fidel would be the guy to run your hardware program, I guess.  No mention of robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was, but from the protester.  Only from the protester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, is there another keynote tomorrow? I don't think there is.  In the past they've split it up into two.  The rest of Google I.O., much like WWDC's developer stuff.  Developer sessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some blue sky, wacky wonderful things about life and computers.  And there are announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you mention Gmail at all? Or Gmail encryption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was the other thing. I thought that if Larry had come to talk, which would have been five hours longer,  the question I wanted to ask was about security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they addressed it a little bit with the enterprise stuff, the encryption both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Separating your personal stuff on your phone from your business stuff.  That's not against NSA kind of security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they showed the Gmail interface redesign.  But no, they really didn't talk about, with the exception of the NOC stuff and the enterprise stuff, they didn't talk about security too much.  Now, this is the part I think where you cut off.  They went to the Google Cloud Platform stuff, which was pretty heavy developer.  Yeah, it was kind of a snooze for me.  I'm a developer.  It is a developer conference.  No, but that was our three at that point.  But then the Google Play, the woman from Google Play got up and talked about Apurify.  She announced the acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They acquired what is Apurify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apurify is an app that helps you test your Android apps across a bunch of different devices.  So do real world testing.  So it's basically helping developers deal with the fragmentation issue and not having to amass a collection of every size screen and a variety of device.  She mentioned Google Fit, which I was surprised that they didn't talk about during the Android Wear section.  But okay.  So it's a single set of APIs to manage fitness data.  And it blends data from multiple apps and devices.  And we saw a few examples.  I think that Noom was the app.  There was a weight loss app that was up on screen.  Then that connects to WhyThings.  You say WhyThings or WeThings?  The scale.  I say WhyThings, but I don't know what the right pronunciation is.  Nike Fuel is going to be integrating with Google Fit.  I saw Runkeeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But just as Nike gives up its devices by...  Yeah, I thought the Nike Fuel.  I thought the Nike Plus was...  Fuel is an odd...  I mean, it's a meaningless currency.  What it tries to do...  Fuel tries to bring all activity into one kind of point structure, which so does this.  So does the misfit...  What should we call it?  Yeah, what's that thing again?  Oh, it's the misfit...  It's the Fitbit.  No, no, no, no, no.  I lost my Fitbit.  Swift.  What is it?  This is the...  It's called misfit.  I like it.  Because that thing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks nice, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it looks like you're an Egyptian god or something.  Is it masculine enough, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's masculine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very, very masculine.  Shouldn't carry a Merse though with it.  We're not going to do a changelog, I guess.  This is the changelog.  Yeah, this is the changelog.  These are the changelogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a list on the rundown of things that we're not brought up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things that we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ten of them from Read Write Web.  Ten things Google did not talk about at Google I.O.  Android Silver.  Silver.  So, they didn't mention Nexus, but they didn't mention anything else in terms of Google devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android One was the device mentioned, right?  The low power, right.  That was the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not even going to make that.  That's just a platform for people, others who are going to make it.  Right.  They didn't mention Android Nearby, which is a proximity service from Google that was  rumored to be announced at I.O., kind of like iBeacon.  Glass, Nexus, Project Aura and Project Tango.  Project Tango and Project Aura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had redashed out of there to get here, but there's a booth for Tango.  I'm sure there's a booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm sure there's going to be some Aura.  I wouldn't be surprised if they gave away some Aura kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aura is the Motorola research project that was a modular phone.  Tango is the mobile 3D machine vision project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the individual developer session, sometimes they give out little kits just to the people  who were in that one session, if you're lucky enough to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS updates.  Nest and Android Home.  We thought there would be a lot more mention of Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they had a couch.  I thought there was, yeah.  Home and Hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a couch up on stage and we thought, oh, this is felt like a Nexus Q demo throwback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last year, they gave us Android Studio.  They didn't really mention that, although they had a lot of developer tools that worked  with Studio, including, you know, real time online debugging, which is pretty cool.  And Google+.  Yeah, so that's pretty much what they didn't say.  But I didn't feel like it was missing because I didn't feel like this was in any attempt  to make a state of the world address.  And the fact that Larry Page didn't show up.  He was there in the front row.  We saw a picture of him.  Oh, I didn't know he was there.  Yeah, he was there, but didn't say anything as he did last year.  Maybe wisely, he probably was advised by people, don't mention the island that you want to  be on.  Can't we all just get along?  That just didn't play too well.  But I think having the CEO speak is important.  That's one thing you see at all the other companies' events.  The CEO does speak.  And kind of sets the tone.  And I think he's missing.  I think Larry is very shy and very hands off, maybe not in one-to-one settings, but in a  setting like this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that this was a year of them better developing their platforms and bringing them  together and making sense of them and revealing and enforcing principles of design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Hover.com.  One of the things Google announced is that they're going to become a domain registrar.  But there's some weird little things in there that you may think I can do better.  For one of the things they said is, oh, and we'll give you who is privacy as part of the  price.  Well, so does Hover.com.  They said you have email redirection.  Yes, so does Hover.com.  In fact, everything that Google offers, Hover offers, without any limits, Google for some  reason said you have a limited number of DNS requests per year.  I don't know what that number means.  I don't know if it's a lot or a little, but why even have to worry about that?  And do you really want to put all your eggs in the Google basket?  Hover is great.  Domain name management, just like everybody else, they're all registered with ICANN.  They're official domain registrars.  But you get great tools that make it easy to manage your domains.  You have a simple process of registering a domain.  It doesn't take any time at all.  You don't have a lot of clicking.  You get who is privacy.  They've got all the big extensions, just like everybody else, .com, .net, country codes.  They also have some really great new extensions like the .club, which I love.  They also have the best customer support around.  Now, I don't know what kind of customer support you get from Google, but it's not from a Python  script.  Let's put it that way.  When you call hover.com during business hours, you will get no wait, no hold, no transfer phone service.  A representative is there to help you.  If you want, they will move your existing domains over to hover.com.  Their concierge domain movement is great.  In fact, you renew your domains for just $10 a year or $10 to move the domains.  That gives you an additional year plus who is privacy plus a lot of other great benefits.  Hover is fabulous.  I think you're going to love it.  All my domain names are registered at Hover.  They now offer volume discounts, too.  When you renew numerous domains, 10 or more, you get a discount.  I have so many domains, that's going to save me a lot of money.  The more domains you have, the less you have to pay.  If you're one of those people as I am who registers domain names just whenever I think of it,  because why not?  Do you have any idea how many you have?  I can go to hover.com.  It looks like 20 or 30.  I mean, it's a lot.  That's the other thing.  I can quickly see it.  Hover.com.  I can manage them.  I can move them around.  It really is the best way to do it.  The Valet Transfer Service, awesome.  For free, Hover will take care of the entire process,  let you know when your domains are settled into your Hover account.  They'll even transfer the DNS settings.  Nobody does this.  In every other case, you have to figure out what your DNS settings are,  change them, go over to Hover, change.  Nope, they'll do it no matter how many domain names you have at no additional cost.  That is great.  That's great.  Hover.com.  I love them.  You will, too.  By the way, use the offer code TWIG6.  You get 10% off your first purchase.  Hover, H-O-V-E-R dot com.  Maybe you don't have a tip or a...  Looks like you do.  You got something you want to mention?  I do.

Transcript:  I'm recycling content a little bit.  We talked about this on Android a couple episodes ago,  but today at the keynote, they talked about how in Android L,  you're going to get your notifications on your lock screen.  They're going to look really pretty,  so you're not going to have to unlock your phone and swipe down your shade.  I'm doing something similar right now with an app called Dynamic Notifications for Android.  Yeah, it'll put notifications of your choice.  I can say, hey, just show me Slack and Trello and Hangouts and nothing else.  It'll put it right on your lock screen.  If you have your phone out and you're doing something else,  you can just glance down at it and see your notifications.  There's a lock screen widget.  You can also affix a widget to your home screen that's there with your notifications  so you don't have to mess with the shade.  There's a bunch of options here, custom screen timeouts,  and you can do transparency and select themes.  Really great app. Love it.  Free with-in-app purchases for some premium features, but it's really cool.  If you can't wait for the Android L notification update, you can get some of it.  Not quite as pretty as L is going to be,  but it might hold you over until the release.  So that's Dynamic Notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you going to get to download the L stuff?  I guess they're going to give you images for the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7 this week.  Yeah.  Will you install it? Do you have an old Nexus 5 line up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, I certainly have a Nexus 7 line around that I would install it on.  I might not install it on my daily driver phone, you know, just because it is a preview, but yeah, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I'll put it on my Nexus 5. Maybe I'll put it on there.  It'll be fun to play with.  I usually stay away from beta. Do you have to be a developer? Do you have to pay any money?  Do you have to say, I won't ever speak of this? I shall not speak of this thing we are doing together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question. They generally don't...  Pretty open about it.  Yeah, they're very... I mean, unlike Apple, where you have to be the developer program, it's $100 a year or whatever.  Android, it's usually just a straight-up download.  I mean, I'll try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff, you have, I'm sure, a number.  I do. I decided so.  How many cardboard boxes did Google give away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, 20% of them went to women.  Here's the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina Lee-Dolores is either bragging about that. Yeah, it's a step. It's an improvement. It's not far enough.  But we saw the real future. I just put it on the rundown. You saw it earlier, but for people who didn't see it,  the video of the girl middle school coders was a tear in the eye moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff looked at me and I was kind of like, I'm all right. I'm all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was too. I was the same way.  It's under the number on the rundown.  All right. Let me pull it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, let's watch a little video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have audio?  They have to, they have to pass everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they were all in the front row.  They were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not create something that will actually make a difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why does it sound so bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GPS and a location sensor so that way you have specific points for each of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like you're not getting the...  Oh, I see. This is a video from the conference room.  Somebody taped the conference.  So the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys have one little tiny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can mess up like the whole app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really great. Don't you love that?  I can't see him, but so many others that will eventually use this app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They care about me. That's why they made this app happening.  So they made an app for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They made an app for him.  They got to run the school.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he can find his way around the class.  Okay, now I am for class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that six girls coded this in middle school?  Yeah.  It is the coolest thing on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I apologize for the quality.  This is actually a screen cap from the event, but...  Yeah, you can see Sundar Parchaik coming back on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite part is when you say,  yeah, you know, you mess up some of the code and the whole thing just breaks.  I hate it when that happens.  I know. It's the worst.  Isn't that awesome?  Just all breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I feel really pathetic with my app pics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You making them cry out here or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not going to make you cry unless it's tears of joy.  So I use a GoPro, as I was mentioning, zip lining.  And so the easiest way to use the GoPro is to install the GoPro app on your Android device.  I use it on all my apps and devices.  It's free.  It lets you control it.  You connect right to the camera.  You get a preview.  It's just so great.  But I don't know when they added this.  There's a new feature, though, that I love in the settings.  You can use the GoPro image of the day as your wallpaper on your Android phone.  So you get new wallpaper every single day.  And it's always some cool GoPro image.  Today's image is a middle school soccer field.  And it actually works out really nicely as a background.  You can kind of see it through the transparency here.  There's a goalie stopping a kick.  But these are always gorgeous images.  Yesterday it was an aquarium.  And a free and easy way.  You don't even have to have a GoPro camera.  Just download the app and turn on the image of the day.  And every day you'll get an image from the GoPro.  That reminds me.  The thing that bored me most today...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that?  ...was ambient pictures on your TV.  I like that.  Visual Muzak for life.  I just found that unbearable.  I'm just looking for another way to leave my TV on.  Oh, yeah. More power consumption.  More...  Wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is images from your own device.  It's your pictures.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got the weather.  Cats?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  I can see the real pet right there.  Shedding all over the place.  The biggest picture frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best picture frame in your house, Jeff.  What?  You didn't like that line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  I thought that was just ridiculous.  That was Google that was trying too hard.  Well, they got these Chromecasts.  Grandparents are going to love this feature.  Oh, I'm happy.  Yeah.  How many remote picture frames have we bought the grandparents that never get filled in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I refuse to buy another one of those.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  I'm like, I'll rig up the tablet, but I'm not buying another one of those stupid picture frames.  Well, now you can just get them a $35 Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simple enough.  Apparently, Google Play Services is now rolling out.  I just checked.  I'm not getting it.  But 5.0 of Play Services will be rolling out with the new security tools, Android Wear support, and more.  So I got the 4.4.4 update just now.  I didn't put it in, but it's there.  You did.  On your Nexus 5, 4.4.4.  And look for Google Play Services 5.  It should make its way to all devices over the next few days.  This is not Google Play Store.  This is that little puzzle piece of services.  But it's actually more important than the store because it's a lot of stuff behind the scenes.  It's going to support Android Wearables, which means your watches, which you get tomorrow, will work.  That's why they had to push it out.  Google Cast adds closed caption support from Chromecast.  There's a new save to wallet button to save offers from your app to your wallet.  Great.  Improved in-app purchase ads.  Forget it.  Don't get it.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you've got to watch.  Why?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's a few more things.  App indexing API.  Anyway, these are always big, and you don't really have much of a choice.  So enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be foisted upon you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be forced on you whether you want it or not.  Hey, it's so nice to have Jeff and Gina here.  I feel like we're at least because this is the second time in a month.  So just come back every other week.  Why don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll just fly out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you?  Let me ask you, are you glad you came out for I.O.?  Definitely.  Wasn't a waste of time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I'm really excited to be here.  And I'll admit, part of it is that I'm just really excited about that watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you do get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get a watch.  But you could have bought for less than the airfare.  But fine.  Well, I mean, certainly.  Yeah, I've been wanting to see where that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm certainly happy to be here today and to be at All About Android last night.  And I got to chat with Googlers.  That was nice.  And it was good to see you.  And I live on All About Android if you haven't seen the show yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also just enjoy being there tomorrow.  And I'll go to some sessions and understand what I can understand.  But also just running into Googlers and talking to them.  That's where the magic happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You always get the back to back, the stories, the good stories, yeah, from the Googlers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the great thing, Leo, is we hit us all crazy is just because of you.  Because the magic of Leo.  People, can we take your picture?  Oh, Jeff and Gina.  We got stopped three times on the way out today.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really just so wonderful.  I'm just on the way out of Moscone today.  People want to take our picture, you know.  It was really nice.  Yeah, so I'm thrilled to be here.  All right.  It wasn't a waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's 93 million selfies.  What happens tomorrow and the next day at I.O. is really for developers.  It's just tomorrow.  It's seminars.  It's workshops.  We have a sample of these things here.  Usually noise does not emerge, not significant news emerges from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There will be some low level announcements that got cut out of the...  Clarifications.  People will write up some, you know, things that they learned.  Sometimes there are, you know, kits, developer kits given out for the lesser projects like,  you know, maybe Tango, maybe Aura.  I wouldn't be surprised if we heard a little bit more about Tango and Aura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Containerizing the cloud with Docker.  Designing for wearables.  Grow your app with Google Identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Google Plus platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A 3D tablet, an Oscar, and a little cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A 3D tablet.  Okay.  So that's Tango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cross platform interaction design.  Instant buy everywhere.  Google Wallet.  The dawn of fast data.  The art of runtime.  That's art.  Upgrading the engine mid...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In every case, this is art or whatever for people who are developing apps.  They're deep dived into these things.  For developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they are going to talk about Nest, but it's going to be stuff that wasn't keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robotics in a new world with a protest or no doubt.  There are also people arrested there on Google in Star Trek plastic outfits.  Stormtroopers.  We call those stormtroopers.  I was age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Star Wars plastics.  These are not the Star Wars plastics you were looking for.  Don't get old people.  Don't get old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep seeing people with Star Wars plastic outfits.  You knock it off.  You know what the problem is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's brain latency.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just takes time.  It's latency.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the flicker in the video.  It's like the design for Google Cast.  And on and on and on it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you guys got to go to some of those just to find out what the hell Google Cast is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DevOps power tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be there.  How about debugging Dart apps with Web Storm?  That's going on right now.  I'm sorry we missed that.  That's going to be some heavy.  Three days of building useless stuff.  The makings of the world's craziest makers conference.  What did you think, speaking of which, of the bowling ball, the Trebuchet, the Rube Goldberg thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, it was just something for people to look at while the countdown was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My gag was there was this huge mechanical thing over in the corner and I said, oh, the algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how it works.  There is an Ignite event.  I think Kevin Marks is going to the right.  That's what Kevin was speaking at that four o'clock this afternoon.  If you run it, if you run, you can get back to it.  Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Gina.  Thanks to all of you for watching.  We do this week in Google each and every week, even without Google I.O.  1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC on Twitter.  You can watch live. I'd like it if you do.  It's great because we see the chat room in the back and forth of the chat room.  But if you can't, we have on demand audio and video available from Twitter TV slash twig or on all the platforms where you could get this kind of stuff.  Our apps, of course, available on Android, on I.O.S., even Windows Phone and Blackberry.  Just search for Twitter.  They're not our apps.  They're third party, the developers, but they do a great job.  And I really am grateful to them for that.  You can also use Stitcher, things like that, or iTunes or whatever you use.  Dog Catcher, Instacast, all of that.  A pocket cast.  Thanks for watching. We appreciate it.  We'll see you next week on Twig. Bye bye.
