Hello, Gina.  Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Good to see you too. Jeff Jarvis is here. He's in Nuremberg, Germany from BuzzMachine.com, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you say paperback is coming out now? No, they're not doing paperback. Damn them. I hate publishers. Damn them. Is there an ebook? Yes, there is. There has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome. Is it late at night? No, it's only 8.37. It is 10.30. 10.30. Okay. Well, we won't keep you up too long. I'll just follow and keep working.  Kevin Purdy is also here. Hey, Kevin. Hello. Great to see you too. Long time no see. Yes, I've been secretly doing things.  Kevin is the author of The Complete Android Guide, completeandroidguide.com. What are you carrying these days? I guess you probably carry them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phone wise? Galaxy Nexus, yo. You're a Nexus 4 guy. No, no, no. Galaxy Nexus. Galaxy Nexus. That old, huh? Oh, geez.  Well, outside of the... In the first world that I live in, I'm thinking about getting the HTC One as is Gina. I love the HTC One. However... Oh, no, the Google-y version that comes out in a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that'll be interesting. See, I feel like there's things on Sense. We talked about this, Gina, the camera and the gallery app that you really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I haven't had it yet, so I'm not convinced that I'm going to miss it. But yeah, the Zoey's look cool. Like, I've seen the demos that you've done have been really cool.  But then again, I look at Google Plus and say, look at all the cool stuff they're doing, the photos there. I could have my auto-awesome gifts and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you get that too. You also get that. In fact, if you do a Zoey, it'll give you an auto-awesome or a Zoey. I have to say, I also have the Galaxy S4, and this is the international unlocked one.  Yesterday, Samsung pushed out a firmware update for the camera that fixed my camera flaws with the S4. So now, I'm thinking that the HTC One is less, for me, desirable. I would. If I were you...  Are they... Is Google going to offer a 32 gigabyte version of the S4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That might be the way to go. The stock edition Google S4. Because then, I don't know, the camera on this is really good. 13 megapixel camera is beautiful. And now that they fixed the firmware, it was crashing a lot. And now that they fixed the firmware, it's good.  Now, remember, we still got the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  There's always a new thing around the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guy Kawasaki, Guy Kawasaki, there's a name you remember, is now working at Motorola.  Oh, really?  Yes, and invited me to an event at the Googleplex next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Just like in a broad invite sense, or did he hand you a card or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sent me an email and said, I would like you to come. It's going to be a small get together of about 50 journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking Moto X.  I'm hoping Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe there's a really awesome cable modem coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new set top box is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Docs is 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys are getting it before even the cable installers are getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hopeful. Now, of course, a lot of the rumors about the Moto X are it's kind of a low end phone, not the high end phone we were hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it'll be like the Nexus 7. Maybe it'll be remarkably cheap for what it is and smooth and impressive.  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I can't wait. But it's Motorola at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good sign.  First time I think they've admitted it.  Yeah, we own that company. We own them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, did he work at Google and then move to Motorola?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. He was, remember for a long time, he was the Apple evangelist, the very first evangelist.  And then independent for a long time. He's written a number of great books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His book on start-up Google Plus lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has been the king of Google Plus for the last two years.  By the way, happy birthday, Google Plus.  Is it two? Is it two years old?  Could that possibly be true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Oh, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're barely two years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Checking, checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I thought that they were going to have a something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That seems like so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it can't. We're literally, we're two years old, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Chat room, do some. No, it's PC Guy says it'll be two years at the end of June.  Really? Are we?  I got invited to the Google Plus two-year anniversary photo walk and parade and marathon and photo apocalypse and Google Palooza in New York, sponsored by Smug Mug.  And that's June 29th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why didn't they invite me? I'm in New York and you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I add, please invite Jeff Jarvis because I love Smug Mug.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you're old and two years feels like two weeks and launched in twenty eight.  Twenty eleven.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two years. Who's food and nude?  Well, happy birthday, Google Plus.  And I have to say, I'm using it a lot more after they keep adding features.  They keep pulling me in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do.  They also fixed the multi four four tiered slide bar problem with the alerts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And have you got the new notifications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The little the bell.  I haven't gotten the bell yet.  The bell. Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have the bell.  Yes, I have the bell.  And the disadvantage is you get rid of those literally four slide bars it had.  The disadvantage is besides it making you very fuzzy on Twig is that sorry, sorry, video people is is that it's a more solid experience of the notifications.  It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have it yet, but everybody's been crazy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's good. I want the bell.  I keep shit refreshing. You got the bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, Chad has the bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It tells you what's new and holds on to it.  You can't next, next, next, go to the item and then back.  Oh, which is rather silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're always tweaking it.  Can you?  Jason says you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can. How do you go next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's up in the corner. You have a previous and next button.  You really do look like Ferris Bueller.  I try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this theme this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the that's all folks mean I look like the turkey.  What was it? The Hungarian flag was the is you look like the Hungarian flag.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This the meme is what is Chad Chad Johnson look like pretty much.  Wow. You're a meme.  I'm jealous. I've never been a man.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I your hair, Leo.  That'd be fun.  What what color would you dye your hair, Leo, if you were feeling adventuresome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brown.  I always wanted brown hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could look like this.  You do look like the Hungarian flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all folks. I don't think that's on the Hungarian flag.  Yep. Yep.  I like purple. I don't know what should I do?  What color would go well with my olive skin?  My bright white teeth and my shining brown eyes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Black.  Black. Black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So let's move on.  Limited time. We've got to move.  Jeff's going to fall asleep.  Kevin's going to turn into a pumpkin.  Project Loon on Sunday.  We had Trey Radcliffe on Twitter because he was one of a couple of people.  It was it was Stephen Levy of Wired and Trey Radcliffe who were invited to go up in the helicopter and watch the launch of the first Google Project Loon balloons.  They go up in the sky. These balloons eventually Google hopes this is a Project X plan to provide 3G quality Internet access to the entire globe from hundreds of these balloons floating 10 miles up in the stratosphere well above the commercial aviation traffic.  One of the advantages of being so high is they can tune these balloons.  There's two chambers. There's a helium chamber and an air chamber.  And they can tune these balloons remotely to make them go up or down to catch the particular jet stream flow to move these balloons to kind of keep them in position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And are there humans actually making them go up and down to catch the right air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  Or is it just autonomous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course not. An algorithm does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a well only if you consider a Python program a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a dot pi script.  It's like fly.  Or is it dot pi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they pulling the signal from cell towers on the ground?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not cell towers specifically.  They're their towers designed to do this from cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say if you let airline passengers know that balloons can do this, but they can't man.  It's going to destroy the navigation.  We're going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at that. These are the pause that Chad pause that.  These are what you get this bread.  It looks like a red Tootsie pop antenna.  This is what people in New Zealand who are the first beta testers of this will get.  Somebody said it kind of looks like a place pin on Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think that's intentional level at best, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I don't know.  Trey was no trace that he was really impressed.  It was very fast.  Really? Yeah.  So I don't know.  Hold on expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is pretty far.  It is pretty far.  I mean, 10 miles is a long way away and the latency is going to be horrendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I see photos of New Zealand, I always just want to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to be a hobbit when I see photos of New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, like the balloon test photos in the videos are just amazing looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  It's very what's interesting.  And I don't know if it's intentional.  It's very near Queenstown where Trey lives.  So he and his family drove over and got in the helicopter.  He got in the helicopter and watches made some great movies.  You can catch those on StuckInCustoms.com.  Jeff Levy is writing articles for Wired about this as well.  Grrr.  Better latency than a satellite.  That's a good point.  I mean, satellite has bad latency, but it won't be as bad as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point of this is to get to remote areas that just simply can't be covered.  And if you have enough balloons up there, you can cover, you know, if we can bring internet connectivity to huge swaths of the earth, imagine what happens when someone has power there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And nobody better to do this in Google.  You wouldn't see there's no extra governmental organization that's going to do this.  No NGO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other great thing.  If they can put some servers up there, maybe we're safe from the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the NSA can even tap the stratosphere.  However, you know, it isn't this is Google's mandate.  They've always said this.  The more you use the Internet, the more we make.  They might charge for this, but I don't think this would be a business anymore than gigabit is a business for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This opens up entire new nations.  Yeah, business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are the last mile problem, right?  Yeah, last 10 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 10 miles.  There are five billion people who don't have Internet access.  So you're talking, you know, about a significant increase in your market share.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're solar powered.  She's really cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  They are set up in such a way that they can take them down when they wear out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They take them down, they recycle the parts, which is cool.  They're landing or collection areas, right?  That they can steer them to, which is really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how that has to be coordinated with air traffic control, though.  That's what the up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's not that crowded.  I mean, down to earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think this is the Leo question, but when can I buy one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Kevin Purdy balloon.  There they are going up in New Zealand.  This is is this a Trey Reckless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is one of Trey's videos.  The one he was talking about with the technical demo still hasn't been approved yet, so it's not up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he apparently was able to go to the staging Quonset hut and record a bunch of tech talks and whiteboard stuff.  And he's hoping Google has to approve it before he can post it.  But he's hoping to post it that would give us a lot of more tech information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is recorded using his Google class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty neat, huh?  Pretty neat.  I guess that's his son.  I guess he did bring his kids.  Yeah.  Either that or he's scratching Stephen Levy's hair, which is a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now Levy was on the right.  Oh, good.  That was his son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.  That's really amazing.  These are more robust than weather balloons.  They're pretty tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is the solar stuff on the top of it and that on the bottom is the transmission piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have to.  Well, if you look at this photo, it looks like that bottom piece has the top layer is solar panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it does.  OK, yes, there you go.  The other neat thing about this is it's a mesh network.  Right.  Right.  They connect with each other.  The balloons connect with each other to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you need that because most of them are not over these uplink facilities.  Those are in major urban areas.  So only one has to be above an uplink.  They uplink and then it spreads it via mesh to all the other balloons.  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing that the 2013 solution to this looks a lot like what would probably be the  1913 solution.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's really out of the box thinking.  And I love it.  You know, I just think that's great.  I am thrilled.  And I think this might actually work.  This is, by the way, not the first time people have talked about something like this.  Even a few months ago, Google was saying we're going to do this in Africa.  But I've heard of remember somebody was going to do an Internet where it was planes that were always up in the air.  This was quite a few years ago.  That's right.  That's too expensive, obviously.  Well, there were airships not long ago.  Yeah, I'm not sure why they don't use zeppelins to do this, but I guess this is the same thing, right?  They're lower-dowels.  Yeah.  A little less expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need fuel.  That's why.  Isn't that cool?  It's really cool.  What strikes me about it is that's a little weird is that it doesn't look very futuristic.  I mean, they look like floating garbage bags.  They're just really long.  Right?  I mean, I would be like, oh.  And remember Bill Gates.  That's how you land in the ocean and choke some fish, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Gates spent a billion, I think a billion dollars on Teledesic, which was designed to put low Earth orbit satellites up doing the same thing.  But this is so much more economical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So smart.  That's great.  Harmless science experiment.  Is that what it says?  Yeah, that's if it crashes.  Harmless science experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is not for the NSA.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe it is.  We laugh because we're scared.  You always joke about the thing that most worries you.  By the way, this is now confirmed from Microsoft and their Xbox newsroom.  Don Matric, who is the president of an interactive entertainment business.  Microsoft is backing down on the most criticized feature of the world.  This is frankly a stunner.  When I first heard this, Jeff Gerstenberg from a giant bomb broke the story.  I didn't believe it.  Microsoft will not require an Internet connection to play Xbox One games offline.  You can set it up and then once get online and from then on it will be a giant bomb.  And then you can set it up and then once get online and from then on it will be a giant bomb.  And then you can set it up and then once get online and from then on it will be a giant bomb.  And then once get online and from then on it will work just like an Xbox 360.  You will be able, there will be no limitations according to Microsoft to using and sharing games.  It will work just as it does today on the Xbox 360.  You can lend, resell, gift and rent disc based games.  Microsoft has for the second time in living memory, completely backed down.  The first time of course is Windows 8.1 where they put the desktop back.  What a shocker.  I didn't think this was possible.  Because of course this is all at the behest of publishers.  They must have, I mean I guess they have enough clout to say EA.  Well this is how we're going to do it.  They were getting a lot of heat from the military, from soldiers.  Said hey we want to bring this out to, you know, we love these games during our down time.  We don't have Internet access in Afghanistan always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah and that's a big PR problem.  PR problem.  We're keeping the soldiers from enjoying our games.  That's a problem.  That's probably wise of them to backtrack on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and PlayStation was also eating their lunch.  Everybody was saying I'm going to buy a PlayStation.  I thought that's breaking news.  I thought I mentioned it doesn't really have anything to do with Google.  A little bit to do with the cloud.  Never bothers us.  No, it never stopped us before.  Let's take a break and do the changelog.  We got some good changelog stuff today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we got a couple of good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  Alright, we'll do a changelog in a moment.  Sound the horns.  Not yet.  We'll give you some time to warm yourself up.  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe just a little quiet horn in the back.  Put your glass on.  Okay, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all we get.  Just to get you in the mood.  Do you get nervous?  I'm sure ready.  Our show today brought to you by 99designs.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina endorses fun.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like fun.  You'll like this.  You may even be a character in the game, Ms. Drapanee.  No way.  In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that you will be.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As will you, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's very exciting. That's very exciting.  Now I'm a little worried.  I can't wait to play the little turf-turbine this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I shouldn't say anything because there's many...  there's many a slip-twist-the-cup-in-the-lip, but that's our plan anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A link to Major Nelson's blog from our chat room.  Very interesting saying that Major Nelson said,  we feel like we had to listen.  Wow, what a thought. Your feedback matters.  Of course, this site is very, very, very slow  because everything having to do with this is very, very, very slow right now.  That's fascinating.  It's great.  Yeah, it's kind of unheard of.  It's for the...  I encourage you to read the entire post from Don Matric for additional details.  No regional restrictions.  Thank you for your continued support.  Larry Herb, Xbox Live's Major Nelson.  Wow.  That is a big deal.  That is a big deal.  You don't see big companies like Microsoft turn on a dime like that usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that quickly even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Privacy authorities say, Google, you got some splaining to do.  In particular with Glass.  And a letter addressed to Larry Page.  Ten privacy authorities from all over...  Who knew there were so many privacy authorities from all over the world?  Oh yeah, there's lots of them.  And they all got together.  And they want... there are eight questions around privacy issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will the guy next to me be wearing these at the urinal?  Yeah.  Is that one of the questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It probably is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they send a letter to Mr. Kodak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would if they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you trying to steal our souls?  Canada?  Please continue to develop.  Pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No!  Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, Mexico, Switzerland.  Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard got an up close look at Glass earlier this year.  Outspoken Southern Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi labeled Glass the end of privacy.  Oh come on.  It really is just a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  It's a piece of hardware and they don't even understand that anybody can create software for something.  I can make a piece of hardware tomorrow.  Well, I couldn't actually.  Anyone can make a piece of hardware tomorrow, a camera, and make it small and do anything with it.  It's big, bad, ugly American company time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I notice it's not coming from the US.  They want to know how Glass complies with data protection laws, what privacy safeguards are,  what information Google collects through Glass, who that information is shared with in a say,  and whether Google has undertaken a privacy risk assessment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a smartphone on your face.  Then they said, can you come over and show us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, we'd like some.  They want to test it for themselves.  Also, we'd be an explorer.  Can we be Glass explorers, please?  That's all.  Google just needs to give them some Glasses.  We have less misinformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well.  Google's head engineer says, we're going to be able to live forever within the next 20 years.  Ray Kurzweil's been saying this for a while, but now he's Google's head engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I totally knew until I saw Ray Kurzweil that, oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I got all excited.  You mean somebody besides Ray Kurzweil says this?  No, just Ray.  No, it's Ray.  It's just Ray.  His subtitle of his last book was, I want to live long enough to live forever.  But you know what?  That's fine.  I don't care.  He's working with somebody to build.  Who told me this?  I think it was Jason.  What's his name?  Who told me this?  The guy we had on triangulation last week.  That they're building these robots to pour your brain into.  They're working on that.  They're working on that.  I just want mine to have a six pack abs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rock solid thighs.  I want to look like that Henry Cavill guy.  Google will be offering unlimited music free via Starbucks and Google All Access.  Smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is it different from...  It's not a partnership.  It's basically a marketing deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Coffee is better with music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you go into Starbucks you log in to their usual login here to get online.  While you're logging in it'll say like, hey you can listen to music unlimited while you're here at Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's pretty much like iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, iTunes only gives you one or two songs though, right?  Right.  Yeah, so they're saying listen to all the music you want for the two hour slot or whatever you get Wi-Fi at Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, we got the trumpets all warmed up.  This would be a good time to play them because it's time for the Google changelog.  The Google changelog.  Gina Trinidad has the log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google has added a carousel of search results for nearby restaurants and bars and other local places to your search results.  Yeah, it's really really nice.  So if you go to Google.com and you type in a query like Mexican restaurants I tried here in San Diego because there's really good Mexican food here in San Diego.  And Google will show a horizontal grid of businesses close to your current location across the top.  And you can click on an image or name to drill down.  You can also scroll, you can zero in on an area on the map shown inside the search results to limit the results to an area on the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's just get pizza places in lower Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, little Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this has been I guess this has been available on iPad for tablet users on the iPad for a while.  But this is the first time it's showing up in the desktop and it's rolling out for in English for users based in the US today this week.  What else? Google's got a new recent sign ins area in your in your account in your account area.  So if you go to security.google.com, there's a new link recent activity and it'll show you a list of your recent sign ins and other security related actions.  If you've made a new application password, if you change your password, where you signed in from, IP address, what kind of device.  So it'll say, hey, you signed in from an Android device from California here, Chrome here.  This is this is this feature is kind of similar to Gmail's recent activity feature, but it's not limited to just Gmail.  It's whenever and wherever you've logged into your Google account, which is really nice.  And it's cool across the top. It says like, see something here that you don't recognize.  You know, here's here's where you can change your password.  So security security enhancement.  This was kind of like what was at the bottom of Gmail before. Right.  Exactly. This is very similar to Gmail's account activity feature, which the Gmail features nice because if you've enabled, you know, if you've given an app access to your Gmail, like via IMAP.  And it's kind of constantly accessing it.  You can kind of see that like automated requests, which is nice.  But this is sign in.  This is this is general account sign in, not just email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for instance, it tells you when you create application specific passwords.  Yeah. So I did one on June 2nd and I can even see where I was because there's a dot on the map.  I can see what the application was for, you know, what I named it and I can click manage and delete it if I want.  That is really great. Yeah, boy, everybody should do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is fabulous. Nice transparency about what's going on with your account, especially if you if you're concerned that there's been unusual activity.  Google's also added 18 new languages for drive docs, sheets and slides, bringing up the total to 65, including Hong Kong, Chinese, Estonian, Canadian, French, Icelandic, Zulu, Swahili majority of languages supported by the built in spell checker.  And users can switch back and forth between languages.  You can also collaborate on drive files in one language while your fellow collaborators collaborators use another pretty cool, pretty cool.  Another Google Drive update. You can print Google Forms.  I love Google Forms. I feel like it's a really undersung, like super handy way to collect data into a spreadsheet.  Now, if you create a form online for people to fill out with drop downs, radio buttons and text boxes and text fields, you can hit the print button and Google will create a printable form that makes it that's easy for people to fill out on paper.  So you can see their chance got enough on screen so you can see what the online form looks like.  And then that the digital form is nice to fill in as well.  This will be, I think, really good for students and in school.  And finally, this is not a user thing, but I thought it was kind of fun.  It's kind of a developer thing. Google's announced sneaker nets for developers who want to use Google Cloud storage.  If you've got a hard drive full of so much data that will take too long to transfer it over the Internet, you can mail them your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a technology they perfected for the NSA, obviously.  They're not going to share with the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you're a developer, you've got a ton of data you want to import to Google Cloud storage, you ship them your hard drive.  It's got to be from a US address.  And for 80 bucks per hard drive, Google will take the drive and upload the data into cloud storage for you.  This, Google says, can be faster or less expensive than transferring data over the Internet.  This is a limited preview and it's just for users with US based addresses.  So, you know, sneaker net, FedEx, FedEx, data to Google.  Now you can actually do that.  But that was kind of fun.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the change log.  And that's what's new from Google.  Noam Chomsky says Google Glass is Orwellian, ridiculous and destroys people.  After it emasculates you.  In an interview with Laura Flanders on Grit TV, he says it's also recording as a camera and a recorder, which means everything that's going on around you goes up on the Internet.  Of course, that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is a guy who hangs out at MIT.  You think he'd know better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He ought to know better.  Obviously not paying that much attention.  But I think that that's the knee jerk reaction of a lot of people to Glass.  Is, you know, it's spying on me.  And the truth is, who the hell cares if Google's spying on you now?  Now we know we've really got a problem.  Exactly.  It's the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The government fancies itself to protect our privacy.  The government is our worst threat to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the bad one.  You know, if Google wants to know what I'm doing so it can serve me ads, that's commerce.  That is not nearly as scary as being imprisoned for the rest of my life because the government's decided I'm an enemy.  And I also know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also consent to that and I can withdraw my consent and you can't withdraw your consent.  Yeah, go ahead and try to withdraw your consent from the government spying on you.  David Drummond went into the Alliance Den, Google, this afternoon right before the show and did a Q&A there.  The link's up on the rundown and just said straight, you know, he just had to repeat the same thing.  I'm sorry you're disappointed. It's not really us.  The problem you have was with the law.  And one of the favorite things was, are you lying about anything?  Are you forced to lie about anything?  And he said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he could be lying about whether he can lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, lying about lying, right?  We don't know if they're...  Right? I mean, there's no way to know whether or not they're lying because they're legally obligated to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple released a very strongly worded statement on its website this week in which they said,  we cannot see what you're doing on FaceTime.  It's encrypted and only you have the keys on messages, on iMessage.  We can't see it.  But that doesn't really matter because...  So what does it mean to ask you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would stop now Google from saying they're going to make it a priority to encrypt everything we can encrypt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it even matters.  I mean, for one thing, people don't understand that.  And the big question that's raised by this Apple statement is it does seem as if Apple can unencrypt the stuff for you when you get a new system, for instance.  So there's some question about what Apple can and cannot do.  But even... OK, let's say Apple is telling the truth.  As we well know, the metadata could be even more valuable, not what you're saying, but whom you're talking to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And...  Metadata is what enables them to make a specific warrant request.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's... To me, it's extremely clear that the US government is now saving all electronic transmissions.  By the way, that's probably true of other governments as well.  The UK government, I'm sure, is doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they're not screaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't hear anything from the UK, do you?  They're in cahoots on this one.  And so they're recording everything.  Whether they're sifting through it or not is not known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the UK ever offers you a cup of coffee, say no, because I mean, listen in to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's encrypted, they probably can't see into it as long as you're using open source encryption.  And this is the other problem is that there are backdoor...  I'm pretty sure they're backdoors into closed source encryption technologies from a lot of big companies.  So assume that you are being spied upon and that...  I mean, I would encrypt, but I don't know if even that's enough because the metadata is so valuable.  So who cares if Google's spying on me?  That's the least of our worries, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Drummond said, there's no gun to my head. I'm not lying.  I believe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, Google does not give the NSA unfettered access to user data.  We talked about this last week.  They don't need to. The NSA can get it upstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's been absolutely clear to that they can't make a direct query to the server.  That's now the NSA has said it. Now Google's... everybody's said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google isn't legally bound to lie about anything. He says, no, no gun to my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He chose what questions to answer. So Gina, partly to answer your question is,  there's a huge wrap to questions if he felt he couldn't have answered that question,  so the question he would have answered would not have answered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And they could be honest.  He could have said, I'm obligated. I can't answer this question because I'm not allowed to.  He could have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fine. I believe that. I completely believe that they're not giving access.  Why would they? Unless absolutely compelled to.  However, there's plenty of ways that this information could be gathered without  any cooperation on Google's part or even knowledge on Google's part.  Nobody's asking Cogent and Level 3 and the other... or AT&T or Verizon or Sprint.  Nobody's asking them. Ask them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I quoted Steve Gibson in The Guardian this week saying that that's the question that still has to be asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Why aren't they asking those guys?  Find out who Google's upstream provider is and ask them.  Does the NSA have access to your servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other issue, Snowden appeared on The Guardian Q&A and it was heavy on rhetoric, I think, a lot on specifics,  and I'm not confident direct operational knowledge he has.  I think he read the PowerPoint like we did.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He still alleges, though, that it's really, really bad. There is direct access.  The NSA is recording everything, that the companies are lying. Right?  I mean, he said that their language was the same and that's because they were all lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He pulled back some, but he said that they're still prevaricating and that kind of stuff, but he didn't say how.  I'm glad we're having this discussion, but I'm not sure how much faith I have in him as a direct source and expert.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's interesting to see how the companies are now using this as a way to prove how committed they are to privacy.  Right? I mean, just what you said, Leo.  They're basically saying, look, it's not us. We're not the ones you have to worry about.  We're about these people. Look. And then Google filed. They tried to get...  They're asking for a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They filed with the FISA court. They revealed they filed a motion with the FISA court.  They already filed with the DSA and let us release the number.  And now they filed with the FISA court saying it's a matter of their First Amendment freedom.  Free speech. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To be able to talk about their court requests. Is that what they're asking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Because they want to break down...  You know, as they said, when Facebook released its numbers, it was a step back for users because the Facebook numbers included local law enforcement as well as, you know, federal law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when I worked with local sites, believe me, the number of chicken poop subpoenas that came out.  Oftentimes they were local cop chiefs and sheriffs who were mad about underlings who anonymously complained about them in forums.  That was the major volume of our subpoenas.  So that, and any stuff, is now mixed in with true federal evasion of some measure of privacy we don't know and some mean, this mean, this release of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that the FISA court will laugh in Google's face, but Google... I think what Google realizes is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that now a FISA action is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least if nothing happens, we'll know the FISA said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At some point we'll ask them what happened and we'll either say they said no or we're not allowed to say which is they said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. We'll know they said no.  Yeah.  The reason they're doing this though is a little self-serving because it's hurting Google. It's hurting Facebook. It's hurting Microsoft.  People are assuming that these companies are spying on them and it's just one more challenge to these companies.  And so they're trying to be proactive.  But I would again assert that this isn't the issue. People are really focused on the wrong thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  So Microsoft and Facebook have published the numbers, the FISA numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. They've published aggregate numbers.  Aggregate numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's the problem. You can't break down...  Whole law enforcement.  Yeah.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that includes people looking for lost phones. It includes people whose parents have Alzheimer's and have disappeared.  It includes all sorts of stuff.  And it's not broken down.  Yeah.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so that's what Google is asking.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chiefs of police that don't like what people said about them and Forbes, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  18,000 accounts from Facebook over a six-month period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually a smaller number than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I...  That seems big to me. I suppose relative to Facebook's whole population, it's small.  Microsoft was 31,000 accounts over the same six-month period.  That's a lot. That seems like a lot.  But I guess when you're lumping together all the little stuff, it's not as big.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what surprises me there is that people had enough interactions with Microsoft versus Facebook.  You would think Facebook would be more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let me just emphasize again that in my opinion, this is pure opinion,  they're collecting everything.  Those subpoenas, those requests for information are just when they've got a criminal investigation going on  and now they want to know all this data we have, who's that?  And so that doesn't happen that much.  That's not the limit of how much data they're gathering.  That's merely...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The better they are at the collection and analysis of the raw data,  the fewer subpoenas they're going to be.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's merely the number of people they want to take the next step on  and we want to actually physically identify them.  Yep.  So I don't think that...  So what?  If it's 5,000, that's not relevant because I believe they're collecting all of our information,  yours, mine and everybody else's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's relevant.  And the thing I'm most scared about, I mention this on Security Now,  is not now but the future.  What if they decide that they just really don't like Leo Laporte?  And they got me on something.  Now's the time that they go and they say, well, let's look what else we got.  And they go back in time through everything else they've been collecting  over the last few years or five years or who knows, it could be 10 years.  It really is only limited by the five zettabytes of storage that they have,  which is, by the way, 5 billion terabytes.  But the discovery...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the two-sided edge.  The discovery, your attorney would say, how did you get this data  and is this allowable in court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because it's a secret action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem is when that answer comes back and then you become gagged  about that, but you would know it personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would know personally, but I could never tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you look at what they did...  Oh, like you could never keep your mouth shut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then I'm going to jail and probably not a jail around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes it's not the things that they use in court  or the things that they actually press on people.  It's the things that they collect and then the agencies themselves  use them to pressure people.  I mean, if you read that book about...  Jeff might know it, the book that just came out,  and it was the journalists' 40-year crusade to get the FBI's investigation  into left-wing groups on the West Coast.  Oh, right. I forget the title of it, but yeah.  Yeah, so they wouldn't necessarily press charges or anything.  They just use all this information they gather to send letters to people  and say, hey, maybe your wife finds out about the affair  or maybe she doesn't, maybe you should quit Greenpeace,  you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you watching the Americans now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I hear it's quite good, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been.  Pretty good, yeah, but it'll only stoke your paranoia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, speaking of the Soviet Union, it was Joseph Stalin's  chief of secret police, Barry, I remember him,  who said, find me the man and I'll find you the crime.  And I think that that's exactly what this is all about, to be honest.  And, you know, I mentioned this, but according to the Department of Justice  interprets the Electronic Crimes Act in such a strict...  Look what they did with Aaron Schwartz.  They said, oh, you know, we're going to give...  It's a federal crime to violate a website's Term of Service,  which it is. That's how they interpret it.  So if you violate...  You know, be careful when you violate websites' Terms of Service  as being recorded, and someday they may be using that against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Aaron's really... That's a really good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect example.  So I don't care if Google wants to give me targeted ads for crying out loud.  Really? Are you worried about that?  By the way, it is the 10th anniversary of AdSense.  Two million publishers earned seven... Is this one of your numbers?  Seven billion dollars last year via AdSense.  Wow.  Wow.  So Google Plus, two years old, AdSense is 10 years old.  Pretty cool.  I've made... I don't know.  I was making $1,000 a month from AdSense for many, many months.  Oh, that's pretty good.  On my blog, yeah.  It was a radio show website and the blog.  It's not, you know...  I'm going to Vegas money, but it's better than nothing.  I think that's really... Maybe in some ways,  AdSense's most important thing is a little pocket money,  a little support for blogs, for smaller blogs.  Yeah, I think so.  It's a very easy way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the thing that I always make about AdSense is that  if the publisher would have tried to control the scarcity,  Google found a way to exploit and grow an abundance.  And it wanted more ads in more places and that's the essence of AdSense.  So credit... I think a lot of credit over the last 10 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the growth of the blog, blogosphere, the blog economy,  goes to AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Tom Brokaw today went on complaining about  how the worst thing that happened is the growth of the blogosphere.  It was the worst generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  E-Marketer says Google made half of all worldwide mobile internet ad revenues last year.  It's only just begun.  It's only just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.  $8.8 billion in mobile ads last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, about $4.61 billion.  This is an estimate. Google's not saying.  Facebook, considerably less, by the way.  Facebook, which had no mobile revenue in 2011,  tripled it to over $2 billion in 2013.  Still less than half what Google made.  But they're turning around mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook, I bet, is going to shoot up in the next few years.  Oh, yes. They already are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, 333% increase from year to year.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just... they're playing catch-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think...  Actually, I've been meaning to ask you of the new Twitter analytics stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not so much new, but it's just as native as all of us now, right, Janette?  We can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we can see it.  So they opened it up to everyone, right?  I had seen it a while back, and I think it's good.  I think it's charts.  I mean, I think it's kind of like... it's an analytics dashboard for...  It's personal porn.  What's that?  It's personal porn.  It's personal porn, exactly.  Yeah, I mean, I spent a lot of time, obviously, thinking about analytics with ThinkUp.  And much like Google Analytics, this is the kind of thing that I would look at every once in a while,  and be like, yay, charts!  But not necessarily maybe look at all the time.  I mean, every day, I'm not thinking, like, oh, you know, let me check my charts.  We... you know, with ThinkUp, we've been trying to kind of move away from the dashboard...  the dashboard format and move toward kind of more of a narrative notification style.  So, hey, here's something that you should actually look at.  I think it's great, though, that Twitter opened this up to everyone.  And I think it's a good start.  I think it's a good start.  I think that it's good to offer these kind of tools to anyone versus just the celebrities or the brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's a reason they do it, because as soon as I went to it, it said,  welcome to Twitter advertising, Leo Laporte.  How would you like to promote your tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do I get the analytics?  I've got to... I want the... oh, here we go.  No?  How do I get the analytics?  I want to see this.  Where... all I got was a come on for...  So I went to my profile, analytics.  Tell us who you'd like to target.  How much do you want to spend?  How do you want to pay?  How do you get there, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm signing in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me know. Yeah, you have to go through a whole OAuth, which is odd because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's a... yeah.  It's a Twitter site, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fair.  Signing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I saw Sarah's analytics.  They looked really cool with the kind of swoopy doopy graphs and stuff.  Yeah, I can see that.  Swoopy doopy graphs.  So you didn't get...  So maybe it's just me they're trying to get money out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on a different computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Click analytics at the top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to sign into the ads.twitter.com.  And then after you get in through Twitter, it's analytics tab at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right on the top of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is what I get. Welcome to Twitter advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Look at my page.  They turned it off. Maybe it was a false report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I didn't get it.  So I'm at my... and you say there's a tab up here that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a tab, it's right next to home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, if I tap analytics, analytics says, this is what I get.  Welcome to Twitter advertising. Maybe I just don't have it yet.  Maybe you don't.  Maybe I'm just unlucky.  I wonder how much it would cost.  Let me just see.  Choose the location.  I'm going to say people in the United States.  Add usernames, people of similar followers.  I want to have the same people who follow Ashton...  Oh, wait a minute. He's A plus K.  A plus K.  Yeah, I'm going to have... those people.  21 in a million. Now we're talking. Okay.  You can limit it to desktop, iOS, Android, Black...  No, let's uncheck Blackberry.  I really don't want to advertise to Blackberry users.  Any gender? No, I want the ladies.  Okay, let's move on.  What do you want to promote? Okay.  Love me, love me.  Say that you love me.  This is my promoted tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the days where I have the most replies, I have the most unfollows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Skip promoting tweets for now.  Good, I like to skip it.  How much do you want to spend?  Zero?  Zero. Is that an option?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is weird. Why is it having you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well apparently...  Are you getting analytics?  Is somebody else getting analytics?  You are? Chad, show us yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting the exact same thing.  You're getting... they want you to spend money too.  I tried to click the get help button, but that didn't help.  Billing history account.  Hit me, hit me.  View my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The two most popular things I've written about recently has been Chicken Wings and XKCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People love that.  Social media expert.  People love that.  Well, I don't know.  I'm going to stick to Think Up for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's go back to Think Up.  That's the way to do it.  You really want to know?  Trust Jeanner.  That's all stick.  Yeah.  I like Fred Wilson.  I like Fred Wilson.  He says Twitter's loss of Instagram to Facebook was an enormous, huge mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you imagine that board meeting?  Yeah.  He's on the board at Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  He's going to spank DiCastallo.  But I think he's probably right, don't you?  Instagram is the social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter had Instagram.  It said it would have killed Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been better than Facebook.  Yeah, that's why Facebook, that's why Mark Zuckerberg personally said, I'm going to negotiate  with Kevin Systrom.  I'm going to get this company.  I don't care if it cost me a billion dollars, and it did.  Then, of course, Twitter bought Vine realizing they'd made a mistake.  But now-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to say Vine didn't quite do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think Vine is growing faster than Instagram at this point.  The kids love Vine.  Seriously, I watch the kids.  I'm looking at the kids.  I've been told I have to stay 500 feet away, but I'm-  So, no, I'm just kidding.  I watch my kids, and they have moved.  They were big Instagram users.  Now they do Vine all the time.  But Instagram, supposedly, in the next few days is going to put video on Instagram.  Yeah.  So, Zuckerberg, I think Zuckerberg outplayed Twitter on that one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good move.  Well played, sir.  Facebook is going to offer free Wi-Fi, though.  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just got to say where you are.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you have to do is check in at the places that offer this, and apparently it will be more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's clever about that is that it's a get for the venue.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The venue as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get free internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you learn about your customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Xfinity's been doing this Comcast.  There is, at least here in Northern California, there are Xfinity hotspots everywhere.  Everywhere.  And-  You can't check in, though.  You have to be a Comcast customer.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but you have to check the venue.  You don't have to say where you are.  I mean, it knows where you are.  The NSA knows where you are.  Yeah.  But you don't have to say, hello, I'm at Leo's Coffee Shop.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  This Facebook thing, Cisco's going to build it into the Meraki routers.  Meraki's an interesting story because it was originally a mesh router public Wi-Fi play  that was very cool.  And the idea was you buy this Meraki router, and it has mesh capabilities.  And, you know, basically it was to kind of do a grassroots global Wi-Fi effort.  And I guess they pivoted a little bit, Cisco bottom.  But now they're kind of back to their roots in some ways because they're talking about  building this Facebook Wi-Fi into Meraki.  So it wouldn't necessarily just be Joe's Java Hut.  It could be Leo's house.  Although most people with Meraki, I guess, buy it for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still trying to get into analytics.  Sorry, I don't mean to be...  Very quiet in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to wrap it up here in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time it's quiet, I think my connection in the hotel has gone down.  I'll go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you know you're always online.  Look, Terry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get charts. I have charts.  You got charts? How did you get the charts?  I did. I just signed in...  Signed in analytics and you got charts?  Yeah, yeah. Analytics.Twitter.com. Yep. I got charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is it about me and Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you go to ads.Twitter.com, Leo?  No, I should go to ads.Twitter.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you've got to do.  I went to analytics. Foolish me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go to ads.Twitter.com and click on the analytics link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's bizarre.  So I went to analytics.Twitter.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think. That's what I did.  I get a funny little dialogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I still get welcome to Twitter advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're using adblock. Please disable your adblock.  Oh, are you using adblock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We probably do that on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we do that on the production computers.  Production computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to buy ads using adblock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a federal offense to use adblock.  You're violating terms of service.  Oh, no. They're going to get me.  Pre-crime. Pre-crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, if I go to ads.Twitter.com, on the top there is a link to analytics and I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I've just not yet included in the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is... I want to make a mistake that they made.  But they've always offered this if you bought ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I've got to say I got the same thing.  Oh, Burke's saying now go to NSA.Twitter.com.  Oh, that's a different kind of analytics.  That'll give me my analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some good news. I presume that a lot of owners of Galaxy S4 will be getting this update eventually.  I have the unlocked international Exynos version.  But this morning...  Word went out a couple of weeks ago they were going to do this.  But this morning I got an update pushed.  I was pleased because I had already rooted this thing because I was getting so frustrated by the camera crashing.  It unrooted me. But on the bright side the camera stopped crashing.  It's updated the camera firmware.  Apparently they added, according to Kevin Tufel, they added HDR video, which I haven't seen.  And they did add, and I found this, a moved SD card in the app manager.  Because these 16GB Galaxy S4s are so constrained for memory.  I only have a gig left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they have a lot of stuff on it to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's another thing. Apparently this is a little smaller.  The firmware is a little smaller.  So you get something like 8 or 9 free gigabytes, which I immediately filled up.  And you can't only move so much to the SD card, unfortunately.  Alright, I think we're going to get ready for our tool of the week.  Our tip of the week.  Jeff, a number of the week?  Got one.  And I bet we can talk to Mr. Purdy, get something from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something cool? Maybe? Okay.  But first a word from Shutterstock.com.  Every time I go to Shutterstock, the number goes up. I should see what it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, OK, this isn't the biggest news in the world.  But last week we were talking a little bit about iOS seven and how you can swipe up that one finger swipe up to bring up control center.  And I think I was complaining about how Android you have to pull down the notification shade and then tap the button to flip it to the quick toggle settings.  Several people told me over the week and reminded me of this.  Two finger swipe down on Android to get to your quick your quick toggle settings.  So it's one of those things not very, very discoverable.  But once you remember that you can do that, it's really nice.  I've been using it all week. So two fingers swipe down and goes directly to quick toggle.  So iOS seven doesn't have a link up on Android with control center.  There you go. I retract my original statement.  Thank you to the six hundred and seventy five people.  It's kind of frustrating. You can't really make a mistake on these shows.  It's really annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's good. It's good. It's good.  It was a humbling Thursday last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just wanted to make that correction.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.  Well, I found this interesting. I had to do a lot for numbers this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the L.A. school system has agreed to spend 30 million dollars for iPad.  For the schools at a cost of seven hundred seventy eight per higher than retail because it has some software involved.  And sorry for, you know, being Mr. Chrome guy.  But I really wonder whether they specifically say, boy, a lot of these are going to have to get keyboard.  That's not included. Wouldn't two hundred dollar Chromebooks have been a better investment?  Yes. Yes.  Unless they have apps that are not available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Unless they have apps that are specific, you know, I always specific apps that they want to use.  There's a lot of educational apps on iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, teaching kids how to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really depends on what they're doing with them and what grades I think for the lower grades, maybe.  I mean, if all you need is a browser.  But well, even for the lower grades, there's a lot of iOS apps.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's well, but it's not. But that's iPad is not the web.  That's the point. The iPad has these these amazing textbooks that are not websites.  They have lots of apps. I would presume that they looked at that.  I know you love Chromebooks, but they don't do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just the price. I'm not. I'm not saying they get the fifteen dollar model, but the two hundred dollar model.  And you get a full computer. No, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get a browser. Oh, no. Here we go.  You don't get a full computer, Jeff. You can't install applications in your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's better for school systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPad is closer to a full computer than the Chromebook is by a long shot.  You can install apps on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, he kicks me when I when I when I have jet lag and I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not kicking you. But there is a difference.  You cannot install apps. You can install Chrome extensions and they are very severely limited.  If you look at the variety and choice of apps on the iPad, three quarters of a million, there's a big difference.  And if they if any of those apps are apps, you know, for I'll give you an example.  Autistic kids have great results using the iPad and software design, specially for them.  That's just absolutely not available on a Chromebook.  I can go on and on and on and on.  And you would.  Now, if you want to teach Python, you probably should get a Chromebook.  I agree. And I and I admit that there is a lot.  It's a lot less administrative hassle and to have a Chromebook.  But but I think that it's not unreasonable to say, hey, if you're if you got a school, you need to be able to install some apps.  But 30 year bond, 700000 kids in the school district will be getting them.  That's amazing. I mean, they could have saved money by giving him an abacus to Jeff.  Doesn't mean it will do everything they needed to do.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seven hundred bucks per seven hundred bucks. It's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree, but it's cheaper than a computer. I mean, I don't know.  I'm not saying that they should. I'm not saying that they should buy iPads either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it's I think it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah.  It's it's called for the sex appeal. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you might you might make a strong case that they could have bought Android tablets.  To save money by buying nexuses.  They're going to pay for iPads for 30 years.  They're still paying that bond in 30 years.  And it's like Homer Simpson says and tapped out, man, are you going to be happy you bought that in the years to come?  Mr. Kevin Purdy, you got something for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like Chromebooks. Really do.  I really do. So I have a Chromebook.  I use Chromebooks all the time and I use them late at night to write articles that should have been turned in the day before.  And in I use on my regular desktops and stuff apps like Flux F.L.U.X.,  which, interestingly enough, was made by a guy who works on Picasso apps like Flux.  They change the color temperature of your screen so that when you're up late at night, you're not blasting your eyeballs.  That's daylight tuned. Yeah.  Daylight tuned light.  And Gina probably can tell you programmers also have issues with staying up late and looking at monitors and getting that kind of keep you awake stuff.  But the reason I'm telling you about F.L.U.X. is that in the Chrome store, there is a extension called G locks or G.L.U.X.  And it is a Chrome extension that basically mimics that kind of color tuning.  So you install it and then it puts a button in your toolbar and basically you click it and you choose what color temperature you want, whatever web page you're looking at to be tungsten halogen, daylight, black, white fluorescent, things like that.  So you might have to refresh the page after you set it.  But basically any web page you're looking at will be recolored to be kind of more nighttime and, you know, low light friendly.  So I like it because it's one of those apps that kind of mimics desktop functionality inside of a Chrome or, you know, Chrome OS environment.  So help me. Wow. This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you adjust it for your lighting for day and night.  It knows your location so it knows when day and night is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And, you know, generally tungsten and halogen work the best.  The others are kind of wonky, but, you know, you can experiment with it, see if you like a color.  I mean, you might not want to use that in the middle of the day, but if it's late at night, it definitely helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the sunset on this on this desktop wallpaper.  I think the stars are coming out. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the Chrome version. Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. I think the problem you're having with your eyesight is the day glow green walls behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So this is my Twitter account.  And so I've changed it using the thing to like say fluorescent and save it.  Oh, I see. You made it. You made it. I couldn't figure out why you were showing your Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And so now, yeah, this is using the Chrome extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. There's some weird ones. So but how would you know?  So tungsten is probably the best. Yep. If you want to really do something nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it. So it's great for Chromebook users and great for those who are just using, you know, Chrome in the web late at night or, you know, in low light conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The stark white of the Google homepage won't shock your system anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very funny. Very funny.  Only my college roommates in college had this. I would have saved so many hours of sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can set it to candlelight.  It's kind of light.  I'm going to do a number, Jeff Jarvis. How about that?  Not only am I going to poo poo your pixel, but I'm going to give you a number.  Four hundred three million dollars. That's how much Stratasys just paid to buy MakerBot.  Whoa.  Stratasys, I think, makes big industrial 3D printers. It's been around for a long time.  And MakerBot, of course, everybody knows is a Brie Pettis is a plucky little personal 3D printer.  Good for Brie.  Good for Brie. Big exit. Four hundred three million dollars for the MakerBot.  Yeah, MakerBot. So that is pretty awesome.  It's a stock swap, stock for stock transaction.  MakerBot will be the consumer and desktop market while Stratasys will continue to focus on industrial 3D printing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So revolutionizing the way that we make products in the future. Four hundred three million Instagram a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think MakerBot might be worth more, huh? But it's not used by as many people.  I mean, you're really buying the users, aren't you?  Yep.  When you buy Instagram and you're trying to save yourself.  Save yourself, Mark Zuckerberg, save yourself. Thank you for joining us.  I want to thank Gina Trippani for SmarterWear.org and Think Up, the best Twitter analytics program you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To do text. And of course, the host of All About Android every Tuesday.  Yeah.  Along with Jason and Ron Richards.  We did. We do a little Android talking here, but it's nothing compared to all about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a must watch. Yeah, we get to really dive in and I understand on Tuesday nights.  Kevin Purdy, thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you happy now about Xbox One? You think it's the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Twitter feed is filled half with people who are saying, way to hold back the future, everybody.  And people being like, yay, Microsoft responding to public pressure like a smart company does. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You did, very mellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always great to have Jeff on smarterbuzzmachine.com and, of course, his book, Public Parts, available in bookstores everywhere.  Thank you, everybody, for being here. We'll see you next time on This Week.  Bye-bye.
