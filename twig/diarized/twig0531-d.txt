I was just like so miserable. I was like this is what  People who have migraines is probably what they experience. It's brutal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes you hate life. Yeah. Yeah, it really really does if my experience was anything similar to what I'm a true my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to have them but they were actually went away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all that staring to computer screens that helped you as you get older Jeff age I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all right, I'm gonna stop teasing Jeff about his wisdom and experience in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I I was at the door. Well, okay, so now we're gonna do the old guy thing  I had my colonoscopy last Friday if you want to hear anything about I'd be happy to tell you there's new treatments better  No, that would be no you young people. It's coming to you. Yes. I doubt  Watch out  So so I was at the dermatologist this morning and you'll check on doing venture and it is kind of little white spots right here  You know, I said what's that?  So yes, those are wisdom spots you get them with a spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was trying for a tip, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually so that's when sun damage and when your skin stops producing melanin you get them  Is that what it is, uh-huh, they're not  spots, but I mean no, they're wisdoms thanks for bursting his bubble  But if it makes you feel better, I have some just brought them all the way back to reality. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Welcome to reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what next week I want you to bring a picture of you with hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who me? Yeah. Oh, that's a good  I can do that. I can do that. I have some old modeling pictures when I had hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, there's more in there. Yes. I feel like he just kind of breezed over this. That was a humble brag  I did what?  First yeah, what is this about modeling? Were you a model? Oh, yeah, I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, yeah 20 some I years now, but I did a little bit locally back home in Charlotte  What did you bottle?  Most of the time it was just clothes and sometimes I did hand modeling and hand modeling  I know but I tell it was clothes and just just being me  Yeah, they needed a black face at the time and and I looked good enough on camera and it worked out. It was fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just the face they wanted the whole look the whole body. Yeah, they had that too  Were these clothes you would have worn oh you weren't paid to oh, yeah. Oh, okay. It was a good fit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a lot of fun good. I was a lot younger back then and definitely want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cheesy catalog or like old-school poses. Did you have any cheesy old-school poses? I will have to look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking the like the knee up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where you're like with your your elbow and the first one that goes in my mind was on a campus was on a university  Campus and they had me like kneeling down just like okay. Yeah, and that's the first one comes in my mind  I think I still have that one somewhere. Yeah, it was like it's so dorky  So I look good. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First you know, I think I think we need you to do to model all the twitch swag  I can do that. Yeah, great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so we know what we're doing next week as for this week  We might spend a whole episode on on your modeling career next week  But this week we got a whole lot of Google on this doc. Yes  I love it when the doc looks like this do we want to start with products or do we want to start with news?  There's  That the products are fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I feel the products all right  Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Well, um, okay  How about this? I've got something right here. Oh  Mmm-hmm. It's in the box  Something is in the box and it's ready to be  Unboxed and I know you guys  It is go ahead show the overhead  Oh, oh it's it's it's a oh, I'm sorry  It's a nest mini I  Really? I was hoping to get the pixel for before showtime today. It didn't happen  Oh, he's taking the cellophane off, but I did get the nest mini so we could start there  it's not quite as entertaining or  Or interesting, but I do have it new in the box and there it is  It looks identical to what you probably already have. Yeah  but yeah, so the nest mini with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Notch so you could hang it now with watch yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now with and I didn't realize this apparently some of the reviewers are that are have I  Played around with this or saying that it actually sounds better when it's mounted on your wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kevin said his review. Yeah, so now I'm curious to see the direction of the speakers on that  Yeah, like why that is different on the wall versus on the flat surface. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Assume it's cuz it the walls most of our walls are hollow unless you've got like a pre-war kind of apartment, right?  So it's gonna help resonate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean if you're on a table, which is the way it usually has been  Well, I like that shot  If it's on a table like there must be something to how the sound  Projects out of the device off the reflective surface and out because if it's on a table  It's more likely reflecting up versus out and if it's on a wall, it's projecting out into the room  Maybe a little bit more that's just a guess but I do also know that they've they've done some work on the speakers  They've added more bass response that you're probably not gonna get a whole lot of bass response out of this little hockey puck right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when he tested it last time it did sound pretty good base wise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin says he didn't know if it had to X the base, but he said it was really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  Yeah, I feel like it's even got kind of like a tackiness here that I'm not used to I don't know but  I mean by all like by looking at it really does look just just like the Google Home  This is so exciting. I know see this is like I'm really happy that we led with the nest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys should have seen  Delivery came in today and the look on his face when he was he got the bot set it down and he opens it  Oh, it's just a nest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was excited. I was like, oh great. This is perfect. I love it when it works out like this like getting a great  Right before the show like the pixel 4 like I know what we're talking about today and then I opened it and it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was a hockey puck. Oh, man. He would just he was up here and then he just immediately went there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay, I'll have to wait a little bit longer for the pixel 4  It's supposed to come sometime this week, but just in time for your next all about Android show  Yeah, yeah sure and then next week's this week in Google well, I'm pretty certain we'll definitely have it on on set then so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can talk about it then but I'm not having I'm not having pixel 4 envy. No, is it? Why is it? No, I  Just I just I'm making my 3a XL. I'm very happy with it. I just  facial recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you been have you been paying attention to some of the reviews that seem to be dropping like crazy right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, what I know you're gonna tell me about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't like I find myself being  Less than excited and I think one of the big disappointments for me that I'm hearing from multiple reviewers  Almost all of them is just battery. Yeah battery  I feel like is just that's just one of those things on an 800 to 900 dollar device  You had the nail battery and if you're not you're doing something wrong, but the 90 Hertz display

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure it looks great. But is that really?  Necessary do we really need 90 Hertz on our phones necessary? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's nice to have there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get it in there and then they turned it off because they know it's gonna just kill the already small battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the weird thing is it only works when your screen is on full brightness or like a lot of 75% brightness, right?  So if like you really have to make that choice like I want no battery life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the anti dark mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the bright mode mr. Jarvis you said you wasn't excited but if you were a pixel to honor would you be excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be very different. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, you'd be excited to just upgrade to something new. It's been a couple of years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I that's what I had before I had the pixel to yeah  And now I have the pixel 3a 3a and the 3a is very happy. Do you miss the squeeze? I miss the squeeze

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should try squeezing your 3a it doesn't work squeeze the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's perfect, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Squeezing this thing for I guess I need to adjust it. It's only on the bottom. It's only the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so it's not the side. Okay, no, no, not the bottom bottom. It's the bottom half  Yeah, it's about of the bottom half of the sides

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've been squeezing it kind of at the midline so it doesn't do it. Oh it did it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're choking the phone  There aren't there are sensitivity settings

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I was sad because I really use that a lot in my like day-to-day phone interactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I kept squeezing it and it was like it's like she just hugged her phone and right just don't choke it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I know I disable that feature. I do too. Yeah  I just found like no matter what's  Sensitivity I had it set to it would fire when I didn't want it to same here  It's like stop it. Like I don't need you all the time assistant. I don't need you right now. All right, same here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think after five years of carpal tunnel, maybe my hand grip strength is so weak  I never unintentionally squeeze it  Apparently I can't even squeeze it when it's there but like  It's so great because I hate talking to my phone because I set off everything in the house. And so the squeeze is just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can just imagine 100 devices saying yes, Stacy. Yes, Stacy. Yes, Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also just added the drag from the bottom right corner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah in order to launch the assistant I think I have that on my swipe up on it  Oh, yeah, I could show that if you're if you really want to see it  Yeah, so you have to kind of go in a diagonal from the bottom you and that does new system

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I never really got into the gesture UI on my phone I just like it old school and this so this is the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is two  Okay, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody at home uses the gesture interface. I turned it off. Okay, I just like using old stock button and on the four

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which you will be getting at some point soon to here too  You do have the ability to opt for the three button versus the gesture

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's still that savvy enough for gestures just yet in the new jet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you won't get if you do that you won't get the super assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right so that's kind of crazy right like right now there was news that  At least with the pixel 4 at launch if you have if you don't have gestures  Activated then you can't access assistant makes no sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely, no sense. You can't you can you still get assistant, but you don't get but not super awesome  So the one is the continual?  conversational version

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why can't it do the other what what is super assistant I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get continuing conversations you get something else. I don't know they were they talked about it at the at the so a lot more contextual

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, yes, exactly more of its on device so you get a little bit of the faster response  So what it like reverts to old dumb assistant?  Like oh, you're not using you just got this weird. You just got the footman not the Butler

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so this is this is a trend. I think we're gonna see more and more especially as some people have G Suite either, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that like you can't you can't be you can't have it on your device at all  It's not that you can't have G Suite account as your primary account

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just can't be there at all otherwise either at all, which is just what Google weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are the people who pay you it's so weird. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's probably to do with like the real the limitations around G Suite are mostly about things like  privacy and  Parsing the data so it could be the way that Google's handling that data is not compliant with what they've told their  Professional customers who want their data to be kept secure. It's not for folks like you and me Jeff  It's for folks like corporations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If that makes sense, I know but they're Google they have they have quantum supremacy. They could fix this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I want so badly like I recommend to everyone they're like should I do G Suite and I'm like, are you a Google user?  then no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no one in it. Yeah, what what other option would you suggest for a professional who wants to have like a small but high-end?  Productivity suite, please don't say Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's about it question that's about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like me if you're on a Chromebook, yeah, you want to have your own domain, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's about it. I can't think of anything else  That would be seamless day to day is kind of baffling to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How the G Suite over the years is always the punching bag for stuff like that?  Continually the punching bag it never gets any better for the G Suite users. Meanwhile, they're the ones that are paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I mean that's really the only other option which is I'm sorry I'm not doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean and that's not all that's missing from the four  RCS support  Which the pixel 3 has?  The before does not is not unsupported on T-Mobile and Verizon at launch even though the three is supported

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't quite understand that story because I thought it also  Put more onus on the on the particular carriers not necessarily the device so it's more on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's it's about it's about the carrier. It is about the carriers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the carriers absolutely because the headlines that I was that I've been seeing have read as if this is Google's fault  They they screwed up and didn't make this available when I mean, I always started

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It mattered most on the network not necessarily on the you could say that if this was a big priority for Google a big enough  Priority for Google Google would have made whatever relationship, you know or management that they needed to do with the carriers to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could say this is not a device that's gonna sell in the billions. So who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So right, so why do they care? Yeah, there's that which I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is unfortunate for for Google's next big market or messaging push  You know because RCS was yet another messaging solution that was going to change everything  story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the plus side you guys it's been what six months or so since Google's last launched a messaging protocol  You know way to look at the bright side sure enough trying I'm in light mode today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can we can automatically switch between light and dark mode throughout the course of this episode  We'll put you back into dark mode for this dual band GPS is hardware that's supported on the pixel 4 but it's not activated at launch  So that's another thing that Google is kind of holding off and say as somewhere down the line will activate it just  Point after point after point. It seems like there's all of these asterisks involved with the pixel 4 and  Like in years past yes people people poo poo the next device and then they get in the like  Oh, well, actually it's not that bad and maybe I'll find myself there too  But I'm just getting kind of disheartened by a lot of these things right now  And maybe that's because I just don't have it in my hands yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the difference you need to see what it works for you and your personal experience on it  All these reviews that have been out there the last couple of days have been pretty downing  And I get it for the most part  But I don't want to just put all of my stock in those just yet because like for example  MKBHD as big as he is  He has a different perspective when it comes to these these these devices and a use case  I remember him making a comment right at the end of his video basically saying, you know  Most people I wouldn't recommend this phone for and so I'm I wanted to ask him  How do you define most people and what is the phone that you're going to recommend cut off? Yeah, you know  Is it the iPhone? Okay. Why is it the Galaxy Note? Okay, why sure, you know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But government coming from someone who has the reach and the respect in the industry, you know  As MKBHD does and he's kind of been a pretty big fan  He's been a pixel phones until now. So for him to say like I have a hard time recommending this for everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of a big that's a big deal in my mind and see when he went into the rant about the 90 Hertz display  And then you top that off by saying most people do you really think most people know what 90 Hertz on a display?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people probably aren't even gonna know that the 90 Hertz displays is  Going on or going off, you know, depending on the brightness setting whatever that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So that's why I'm like why wouldn't he recommend it for most people, you know, just just for little comments like that  But I'm not taking a dig at you. Mr. Brownlee. I was I'm just curious if you can get this message

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I want to do a review show where you hand you let go to a I don't know pick an office school a nursing home  I don't care and you give the device to people and you ask them to like hey  Can't you use this because I think  In granted you should give it to him for a week and then come back but that's in our world  That's crazy long amounts of time. But yeah. Mm-hmm  I always my test is it's not my mom because my mom is actually pretty technically savvy, but I  Do I do think about like my mother-in-law my father-in-law and I'm like, yeah, can they use this?  Because I mean we're very well actually not me because I'm a pretty normal person I couldn't even figure out how to squeeze my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Normal as you sit and talk about the spectrum, you know and in wide band come on you're far from  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On phones I have other things I'm I'm not normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe those are the things that you're not normal on open you up to an ability  of ease like approaching some of these  these phones  From a perspective of ease versus someone who is completely outside of the realm of technology that gets it  They're gonna have a different opinion probably, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like your idea and I particularly do that with Queen Pruitt when it comes to these new phones and  Still one of my favorite stories is is when I bought her the notes  Eight, I think I believe is what it was and I had to return it because it was too much  it was too busy and  She just could not dig that interface because previously she'd had the original pixel. I think that's what it was  Okay, and she says can I have my pixel back?  You know, and she's you know, you know that that struck me because I know she's not the most tech savvy person out there  And she's always dropping the phone and busting it up, you know, but that's another story  But for her to say this user interface is just not something that I can jive with at this time, you know that that  Surprised me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what what is she using now? She's still using pixel 3 the pixel 3. Mm-hmm. Okay  Great great phone. I'm still using pixel 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the big bucket notch and all with a big bucket notch that you can disable, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can you can bring down the the forehead on that and not look at the notch if that helps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's another thing people still gripe about notches and things of that nature  But yet they still want the technology behind the notch, right?  About the forehead on the pixel 4 and I'm like, well you moaned and cried about the notch  But you still need all of that stuff in this body for it to work. So  You can't have it both ways. That's my opinion now granted. I think one plus is doing a better job from the bezel standpoint, but  They don't have radar, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right  Do they need radar?  That you know that that becomes a question that I have is  you know a lot of the reviews that are coming out right now are are  Saying saying a lot of similar things and solely seems to be very mixed where it's like, okay, it's not always reliable  It's totally underutilized, but it does speed up things like face unlock. Mm-hmm. So I hope they patch it  I don't want anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which you don't want anything, right? Which you know, and they've got a patch it so your eyes don't I mean  Yeah, I hope people oh boy. I'm like, oh, that's terrible. Yeah, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right now the face unlock will work whether your eyes are open or not  And I don't know why you roll out that security feature with that even a consideration. How did I pass Q&A?  I don't understand but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently that's the way maybe they were all wearing sunglasses like and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I was supposed to bring there in the office  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the sunglasses in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna say about solely because I do think people don't understand what this is about  I wrote about it and this is not shameless self-provotion. It's I feel kind of sad that I'm self-promoting  but I talked about  Why this matters and it's tied to  Basically this idea when computing is everywhere  you need a way to tell computers that you're talking to this particular device, right and  Proximity and the ability to understand that you're right next to this device and asking it a question  Is going to be essential and it's I tied in the article I wrote  Yeah  This to Apple putting UWB ultra wideband on their phones  Which they're using right now or we're talking about them using for location based services. But all of this is basically  Computings and everything  You're not gonna want to be like dishwasher

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please start now, right? You don't want to just sing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're gonna want to stand next to it and say like turn on or whatever and as these devices start  Having these radios. They'll also understand when they're right next to things that they can also  Work with and I think this is gonna be way more exciting and Google's effort to put this on the pixel was really  To get people started thinking about it, but it's also to see  like what are the problems associated with this technology and  What do we need to know about it? So I'm really high on solely. I'll be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you and mr  Toffle said it best last week with with one word presence and that makes perfect sense there, you know in like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Real like like presence like right now and did I tell you about my liquor cabinet example? You did not please proceed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  liquor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So way back in like  2013 when I was getting excited and into the smart home  I put a motion sensor on my liquor cabinet  Okay, and the idea was when anyone opened it we'd get a notification this turned into a huge problem  Because my husband and I were always opening the liquor cabinet my daughter  At that time she was like six or seven. So she wasn't interested, right?  But we what we wanted to do was have a Bluetooth sensor  Tied to the motion sensor and I bought like an ambient  sensor and the idea is I wanted when my husband or I were right next to the liquor cabinet opening it  You don't have to send a notification  But if my daughter's next to it, I want that notification because now she's 13 and she has all these friends and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that use case

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in this is this is an example where proximity allows us to do things that right now are really tough  And if if that sensor had UWB or solely and here's the next problem you guys there's gonna be a standards fight over this  Makes you so happy like I just love a good standards fight  Makes life so hard for users  But that's that's where we're going and that can be in a friendly way  So like you don't have to buy like I had to buy this separate Bluetooth sensor  And there was like code that I had to download and I never got it working a hundred percent because it was just hard  but how awesome would it be if you could just stick like a  $12 sensor in your liquor cabinet and you'd know if your kid was to like stealing alcohol. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's not just presence that you're talking about its presence and I and  And identification well presence proximity and identification right because you need to know who is actually there because as as we were talking about this  I was thinking well the nest mini going back to that product actually has something along these lines  It has the ability to light up the the volume  When has an ultrasonic sensor it has an ultrasonic sensor  So so it can detect presence and it can in proximity, right? But it has no idea who it is  You know what I mean, so that's the other  Star of this that's a start is to know. Oh, it is my daughter versus it's me or my husband  Don't send me that notification. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and ultrasonic sensors are all over the place. They're used a lot like, you know, those water filters are water  Delivery devices and airports, you know those filtration systems  There's an ultrasonic system sensor in there saying boop boop. You're full

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you're not full. It stops filling at the right time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So UWB and radar both pretty expensive so they're different than the sensor that's in the nest mini  but it's a similar use case because I'll say that was super necessary in the nest mini because I  Mean beforehand you'd sit there and you're like, I want to turn the volume and you just hit it randomly, right?  Where's the button? Where do I tell and it get louder softer ask you questions and you're like shut up. Just stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-huh. Just volume up. Yeah, and actually one thing I just a couple of interesting things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're totally hopping back and forth that that's okay a couple of interesting things. I read today about the nest mini  These new the new nest mini will allow you to pair a stereo pair of two of them  So you could hook them up as stereo as stereo  On the ones before and what was the other one I had Oh Oh  So you could listen to dark side of the moon  Way  Yes  And then another thing that it does it reintroduces the tap on top to start or stop playback  If you remember the home mini did alright and they deactivated that because Artem Rezikovsky from Android police  Had realized that it had been constantly recording him because the fabric was registering as a touch  So it was constantly like sending audio to the cloud  Instead of fix it they deactivated it entirely and they just never reactivated apparently on the nest mini that's back  So that was one way to fix it though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They probably they realized oh that was an error in manufacturing  Which is why I see they're staying solely on the phone because they're trying to play with this new technology before they like try to  Deploy it crazy wide. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a funny tweet that I saw  Last week I have it in the dock. It's by Ivan curick. It's a  Compilation of what was promised by Google was solely and then what was delivered and you know what was promised  You know the the concept video when they were first introducing it  I mean, you know people are adjusting their watch with their fingertips doing all these really cool things and everything  You know flipping through presets on a radio and snapping to say, okay  Except and then it switches to the phone and no stay on it  Switches to the phone and it hardly switches the tracks anytime they wave their hand over the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all of those things are still possible it's just  one day  Software updates can get you to that  And you know like because before I wrote that story  I actually read a 2016 paper on solely with all the equations and everything about the three millimeter accuracy it  Is pretty cool you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gonna make it is it is cool technology  It is also isolating this phone in certain markets  India cannot sell the pixel 4 or rather Google cannot sell the pixel 4 in India because they were not able to license the  the  Spectrum the 60 gigahertz. Yes the 60 gigahertz spectrum in that in that country  So therefore and and Google's made a lot of noise the last couple of years about how important markets like India are right?  Right, but at the same time  Merging markets exactly the next billion, but you know is the pixel for a big seller in a market like that?  It's probably way more expensive than a lot of the phones that are offered right and are actually selling in that market  So maybe it's not maybe it was  It was fine. I don't know  but  We will find out I guess I'm looking forward to playing around with the device to see but I just want to use the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not necessarily thinking much about 90 Hertz. I'm not thinking much about  All of the other  Googly stuff that's built into the OS just I just want to see how well the camera works  Yeah, so do I know and I'm sure you're gonna get answered to phone calls a month with it great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many how many of these did you guys order

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean Leo has his he's gone. It's gonna deliver probably before mine mine's scheduled to deliver on Friday  Leo got his order in during pre-order so I expected it like today maybe tomorrow  So you got three at least and then then and yeah. Yes, we have three did anybody order a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chromebook  Pixel go no  Did not nobody know no I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For I5 and that pricing just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I when I think about it like again, I have no reason to replace this thing this thing is  Pixelbook is still rocking for me. It's the same weight  Yeah  Yeah  So I feel like it's fine. Like I don't feel like I need to upgrade to that one  I'm curious about it and I would love to review it and spend some time with it  But I don't feel like I need to replace this with that. Yeah feels great. Yeah, I'm with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would still keep that I need a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  therapy session with Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just might do that his ears are burning this is a good program or can he program in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blanket denial to any dark mode things  None allow a dark mode denial, but I saw that thing today. What was it for the new the new chrome version?  I got really scared. It had instead it had forced dark mode  I was getting  But it was just saying that it would force dark mode even on an app that didn't have it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right that and that even he's not gonna force it on me Google. No, it did not call call you out by name. Thankfully

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

That's monday.com  Slash twig for your free two-week trial and we thank monday.com for their support of this week in Google  We kind of glanced over the the whole  Face unlock with eyes open closed or whatever, but I thought it's important  I'm not sure if you guys talked about it last week whether it was news then or not that the Samsung  Galaxy s10 to hear about this one that the fingerprint sensor  in-display  Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. There's a British couple that realized, you know, this this woman set up the phone  Learned it learned her right thumb on it  And then she ended up by accident using her left thumb on on the sensor and it let her in she's like, okay  That's weird. You then she gives it to her husband both of her husband's thumbs work on it  Then she gives it to someone else something it turns out the screen protector that she ordered on eBay is like $3 screen protector  Samsung's saying don't use any screen protectors that aren't ours because  So talk about like biometrics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, how would know that is it just is it making the resolution  More or less granular or is it just making it not work? So samsung was saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  certain silicone based screen protectors, which  We're talking about a little bit and the after show of all that Android last night  Like I was thinking it was just like certain, you know  Flat screen protectors that you put on and then you you know get the like air bubbles out and everything like that  Victor who is who's the TD for that show was like what if it's more like they you know, the tacky kind gosh  I'm suddenly blanking on the name of it zag zag makes the invisible shield  Yes  Maybe it's something like that because from what Steve Gibson on security now is saying yesterday is that it has something to do with like the  The the layers so you've got the camera shooting through the glass  So that's one layer and then you have this like sticky silicone layer into the glass protector  Into the fingerprint and there's something in those layers  That's that's like imprinting a pattern into the fingerprint sensor  And you learn that supersedes the layer that your fingerprint is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's learning the wrong  Thing yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  generic thum  Exactly exactly. So any thumb touched on it and it automatically it recognizes that there's a thumb there and it recognizes that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pattern from the story of the rundown is that a couple banks have now disabled  thumbprint

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verification yeah those phones. Yeah, right. They're not gonna mess around with that. So  And Samsung's like why don't you just buy ours?  All you got to do is just buy hours that's the quick fix for it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly no devs involved just just buy a new screen protector from us. Yep. So it turns out biometrics are not easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, can we have a little moment of silence for VR? Yeah, let's do that  Okay, we've done it, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  VR on the phone, I don't know about all the  Enough of an ecosystem right now. There's a lot of people that are jazzed about it  But mobile VR there was a lot. There's a lot of friction with mobile VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't make it easy for people regular people to just jump right in is even though it looks so stupid  Well, well if you play in a game, you don't care how you know if you're having fun, you don't care how you're looking, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if I'm using VR, usually everybody's asleep, right?  I'm looking dumb. Don't get me wrong. I'm in the middle of my living room looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't care think about the Wii days the Nintendo Wii days  Do you think we looked elegant with during bowling and tennis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, no one here we were just having fun. Yeah, I hate VR and I hate VR because it I  Have to close off my vision of everything in the world and I don't feel safe  So I hate VR in it like in a trade show environment  I I don't feel a hundred percent comfortable in my home with it  But so I have always been called gonna say finally I can get her  My poor dog I trip over her so often now that she now whenever I stand up she like runs under the couch  But so I will I will throw that out there cuz I feel like people I know I'm not alone in this  So yeah, I feel like there's a whole bunch of people who are like, yeah, there's no way in hell  I'm gonna like close off my vision and  Deprive myself of a sense just to play a game, but that's just what about a R  Air's fine. Cuz you know  Well, as long as I can still see the outside world, I just I need to see what's coming at me

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gosh I've really really enjoyed VR the more I've gotten into the oculus quest  The more I'm like, alright, they're doing something right here and they actually they have a system that lets you see through  To the outside world they call it the guardian system  so, you know you kind of you draw your area that you're in VR in and  Anytime you get near that that boundary line  It's like the real world starts to fade into your view while you're in VR  So it's easy to kind of look outside and realize oh, you know, there's the there's the couch  I don't want to trip over that or but I don't know if it's gonna be that accurate if the dog walks into if your dog  Walks into you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Petrified it's not not as much of my home  But the reason I don't like it is cuz I I'm worried that someone's gonna attack me  It's just a it's a lifetime of being alert to someone trying to come after you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, I don't fault that. Yeah, I  Still use my daydream  To this day, what do you use it for? Well, I mean they are but what I'm like, then it's not for gaming or anything  I just like it for the theater mode when you put in Netflix or flex or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's something I've never had the desire to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I can just grab my daydream and go to my favorite recliner and tell everybody to leave me alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What dad's watching the movie? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll grab my favorite headphones plug it into the phone and fire up Netflix fire up my plex or what-have-you  And it's so immersive because it's just like miss Stacy said it blocks out the environment  So I don't see all the ambient light or anything like that and I don't hear my family or an intruder. Yeah  You know, but excuse me, can I steal your  but it's nice because  Especially like with Netflix and Hulu they give you this whole living room environment  yeah, you sit down and it just looks like you're looking at a  150 inch screen and and you have great audio on your ears, but you can't yeah  I have this vision of a sitcom episode in which

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dad Pruitt is on the recliner and the family quietly moves all the furniture out of the room while he's watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a BMW ad where there  The boy there's a guy and he's sitting there playing VR in an almost empty apartment  And these two girls come in and take the last piece of furniture and walk out and stick it in the back of their  nice BMW and  The voiceover is like, you know the BMW  Well, it's has room for all of your stuff  Even if something and I can't remember the punchline  But it's basically like and then at the end it flashes back to the guy in the house and he like pulls up his goggles  And he's like hello. Hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's so immersed speaking of car commercial he's lost  What's your guess about the guy with the beard in the Volvo commercial and I think I'm taking him back to prison  I haven't seen it. I've no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, is this on like standard television? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh you cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow that was quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm subtle but we all got it that's not so subtle. I got an itch in my hair right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always wanted to be a female astronaut

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not seeing that ad  You know to bring you'll have to bring that next week  We're compiling a list of all the things we have to bring next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even even with with Google cool killing this off  I  Word those the folks at Oculus Stan and Facebook and their investment behind this  Do you think they're going to continue to make the investment in it for another? Oh, yeah five years. I do  I do be that they believe that they believe in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that the Oculus the the high-end Oculus hardware has a really great path right now  Samsung's  Gear VR headset is also done  So that's kind of part of the reason behind this verge article that Adi  Wrote is that Samsung, you know, basically the note 10 was incompatible with the gear VR to which John Carmack  Who's the CTO of Oculus?  Essentially you eulogized all right the headset to say hey, you know, it was good for what it was  But we're done with it. We're moving into this area  And then of course Google no absolutely no phones that have been released in 2019 from what I understand our daydream  View compatible 3a isn't the four isn't and so Google's saying yeah, you know what that just  Consumer adoption was low. It was decreasing over time  There's just not a whole lot of demand there consumer adoption was lows because they didn't help it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they didn't help people try to adopt it they didn't push it the way they push the  New Ness many that you just was so excited to see this morning, you know, that's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of Google they get excited about things and then they lose their excitement and along with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Buddy VR though, everybody else they just did it because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, I was gonna point out a story that's both cool about VR and a good example of why mobile VR doesn't work  Okay, or sir  So this isn't ours technica. It's about Microsoft's dreamwalker  This looked and sounded so I mean I would never use it because again  I do not want to be in a virtual world when I'm out in the real world, but  They have it basically maps where you are in the physical world and  Creates a VR world around it that is built on top of actual obstacles that you'll encounter  So it gives you reasons to like stop at a crosswalk for example, so it's pretty cool  I mean, but if you scroll down in the article that I linked to  It's in the show notes  You see the guy with his headset in this backpack computer and  Scroll down there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No big deal what that's just a random person gonna get attacked no everyday person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we've all done that not gonna get a tent and probably not a date either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is why it's not you know awesome, but at the same time I'm like that's kind of a fun use case if  Again, if you're not worried about being attacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right  Have you heard about the void?  Yes, I would love we have that in in the oculus. So it's not it's not oculus, but it's in the oculus at World Trade Center  in New York, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I was like yeah, it's like a Star Wars experience and Avengers experience event event center where you can go and it's like  large scale  VR roaming VR where you have the backpack and  Right and there are objects in the space that like the virtual objects that you see are  Matched with physical objects that you feel when you reach out to touch certain things and everything like that  I love I love that and I think that's that's got a big future for VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if anything else that does see I think that works too because it takes me back to the days of laser tag  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I still play laser tag cuz I've got a 13 year old so  Same here nice. Yeah still a thing still still a thing that happens. Yeah  And it's better than paintball because you don't get whacked with hard balls of paint. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although that's kind of the beauty of paintball too because then there's actual fear behind playing it  You're like actually I really don't want to get shot  It's been a long time I played paintball and it was frightening  But also really kind of a lot of fun because it was so frightening  Man, you just really don't want to get hit when you're playing paintball now even I'm still thinking this whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Consumers not latching on to this VR thing. Yeah, I'm thinking about homes  You need a lot of space in your home more than like yeah true for these these apparatus to work  I don't care how good it is  But if they don't have the spot for their their rigs or whatever in the spots to to move around freely  It's not gonna catch on is there anything being done for?  The average Joe's room to be able to enjoy VR that you that you guys know of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could put your coffee table and sofa on casters and just roll it out of the way. Okay, there's that option  I have a friend to  She does development for VR when they built their house, they actually built a room for her to work in  okay, that was a VR room and  So I think the walls were painted. I think dark gray or maybe a lighter gray for some reason that's easier  It was empty and it has specs in terms of like how wide it needed to be  so  Yes, but she that's her job. I mean, right rolling your  Purned-out-your-house-out-of-the-way is probably the way to go now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right not every not every house is gonna have an obvious space for this like in our living room  We don't have a coffee table in our living room  So automatically in the in the the front, you know in the center of our living room  I mean, it's not the hugest where do you put your feet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do you eat dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the question  We have an ottoman for our feet we don't need a coffee table for that  But I mean but I can make that work and I mean to answer your question like just taking the quest is one example  the quest can operate in  In kind of like a standing or sitting mode  It can also operate in a free roaming mode and when you do that kind of free movement mode  That's when you draw the boundaries so you can really make any amount of space that you have  Usable space and within the game that becomes just a little bit more dynamic, you know a small room  You'll have a little bit of wiggle room to walk back and forth but a larger room like one day  When I was borrowing Leo's I came in here after all about Android was done  So there was nothing going on the studio and I cleared everything like I pushed this table back  I cleared it all out and I tried that and I mean I was walking around the grocery store and job simulator  Behind I could do things that I just didn't think were gonna be possible right and it was it was really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it was awesome. Yeah, and TJD just says that the rift needs five by seven feet  Usually that that's not very big and I could see not big, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see that being feasible in most homes, but something like a rift needs a big system to power  Yeah, you need so when you're talking about like wide mass adoption or whatever, you know the everyday person in enjoying or experiencing  VR that's that's where something like the quest seems to be the right approach  By the way, the quest is not off-topic for this show because it is powered by Android. So there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason I love how you feel like you have to justify yourself when when it's just Leo Jeff and I were just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about the Beatles for 20 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not in favor of that by the way, oh man, I wish I was here for that conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Jason  I could have pitched it I could have held my own from probably for a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, so so when are we gonna talk about quantum computing sure right now wait now or or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cereal cuz I don't understand what that is. What is the cereal? Yeah, how did how did we go through the pixel four thing and not?  Talk about cereal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it the UK wasn't some

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Delivered in cereal boxes. Yeah, so I guess it's it's a promotion happening only in the UK  They only had two thousand of these being sent out  But people some of the first customers are receiving their pixel four in the UK in what is a cereal box  That looks you know, it actually has some cereal inside  So they're you know, multi-color edible cereal. That was like yes  No, I mean nine to five Google posted a gallery and full review. They said  100% of your daily allowance of magic curiosity and feeling lucky  These are cheerio wannabe hoops with Google branded marshmallow bites and what they believe to be small  meringue  gems  That's cute. And I think the final verdict is that the price per pack of around  $799 makes it really hard to recommend picking up a box unless you really need 16 point seven seven million colors in your bowl

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way there's a prize inside right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A phone but no headphones by the way, I'm gonna get headphones in the box pixel four, which is a little interesting too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy you brought up the story of cereal. Okay. Yeah, I saw that in the rundown. I was so confused. All right, how about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I put that I was I was overjoyed with that. I want I want pixel for cereal that I'd get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, I mean it looks magically delicious it's cute  Let's see here  Quantum  Okay, so this is one of those stories that like I read it and I'm like, okay, this is interesting  I don't I have no idea the science behind it or that's why Sundar's interview is very interesting way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, and I did not read  that  This allows them to the practical use that he came out with was that it it allows you to  Model a molecule and all of its forms and could have huge impact on medicine and things like that  And the caffeine alone has 10 to the 48  different  somethings and  It would take one of even the quantum computer couldn't do all of its somethings somethings. Okay  Right  So what is what are you actually?  Introduce this so okay. Oh, sorry. No, that's about it two weeks ago. Oh we did  When the paper leaked we talked about it, right?  Like the official release of it. This is the official release the paper. Yeah, so Google officially released a paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  declaring itself  Declaring that it had reached quantum supremacy and I'm gonna put those words in quotes  Because quantum supremacy the idea behind this is it was I think was proposed like  seven or eight years ago and the idea was a  To perform a task in a time much faster than practical than a  Traditional computer could perform it practically  It's a little bit of a moving target  But Google said that they had achieved a quantum computer named sycamore  And it is a 54 qubit processor if you're tracking qubits the last qubit computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we talked about was like 36 or so. So this is the ARP. How many qubits was the ARP? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It took me a minute Jeff, sorry  So these are qubits with a Q not with a C  And  They basically said that they could do this faster than the fastest supercomputer out on the planet today  I  Forget what they were computing though  Okay, so they were doing that now IBM came out and so like I don't think so our fastest computer  Because Google said it would take it 10,000 years  IBM's like no we make the fastest supercomputer on earth and it would take it 2.5 days  So that so I'd be it so yeah, so there's like this little like fight over  Length of time the bigger thing and so that's kind of what's happening now  The big thing is quantum computing is important because it allows us to solve problems that we haven't been able to solve with traditional  Computers, right and it does so in a completely different way. So like what Jeff's talking about with the molecule  when a computer is trying to when a traditional computer is trying to like figure out the position of  all the  Atoms in a model molecule. It's atoms and the parts of the atoms in a molecule  It has it's going to start crunching those numbers and doing the modeling and as it gets successively larger  It's going to slow down because it's just too much and it's gonna be like it's kind of like if I were running a marathon  My first mile would be okay. My second mile would be okay. Actually, my second mile would be dead too, but I'm gonna get progressively  In a quantum computer  It's like I were running the marathon except I'd be driving a car and I can just maintain the same steady pace. So that's  That's how to think about this  So Google's argument that they've achieved quantum supremacy is they can do this in a way  That's a faster than the supercomputer but be they never ever ever slowed down  So that's the big oh, oh and I was explaining why it was important  Because there's a whole class of problems and complicated things  We can't currently do on today's supercomputers and especially in an era of like climate change drug discovery. This is gonna be important  Hmm. Also it will help with Wall Street trading  Okay, hopefully that helped  And hopefully y'all didn't all fall asleep. I'm sorry. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I hear about quantum computing I I'm trying to think about real-world stuff and the fact that you put in  You know the stock market in  Climate control that makes a little more sense now because we have right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can take days for a full-on weather simulation to take place  So like when you're predicting like a hurricane, mm-hmm that can't on a supercomputer  That's a lot of time and it could take a lot of time to understand what happens  But imagine if you could do that in five minutes one  You can run so many more models, which means you can add in like data points as they come in, right?  So like so that's gonna be really a huge. I mean weather modeling is a huge  Right when we do something that has so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's got a moving target like forecast and I guess that makes a lot more sense because you get all these extra variables and  Like you said you throw these extra data points it we can speed up the process of figuring these things out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what you saying, right? Yes. Okay, and there's there's tons of other things  I mean like we don't even know I mean part of this we don't even know and there's the whole  Cryptography debate because it could break like 256 a ES encryption very easily  random numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so here's here's suenars  The other reason we're excited he says is take a simple molecule caffeine has two to the forty-third states  Then MIT technology review has a footnote saying caffeine with 24 atoms can exist in 10 to the 48  distinct quantum states  ie  Configurations of these atoms that means for a classical computer to perfectly represent caffeine  It would require 10 to the 48 bits close to the number of atoms in the entire earth  10 to the 49 or 10 to 50 a 1 gigabyte memory chip has about 10 to the 10th bits  I'm sure that was very helpful  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got you. I was like, I'm with you. So the other thing though. We have to think about  When we think about computing  Immense computing power, right?  So like you've got massive supercomputers that consumes a lot of energy to model these things, right? Right right now quantum computing  If it can do it super fast and yes, we'd still have to cool these down tremendously  We could end up saving energy we might not though I don't know that's what that's still an open question  Will quantum computing be more energy efficient? And I think that's something we should be thinking about the current

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Climate as it were well when well, when can we find out and you know, they're saying they've achieved these  quantum computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so quantum computers live in these  In these uncertain states, no they live in these um, they live in  We don't have good programming tools  So right now you can't do whether every time you write something for a quantum computer to do you write it from scratch, right?  And there are very few people who know how to program a quantum computer. Okay, all get Google or IBM, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's that that's a good one. That's a quantum computer. Like they they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not something you can like buy off a shelf for oh, no, I get that but I'm just saying if you could Leo would have  People if we have people that are able to sit down and write to to write the code behind it  Okay, so where are they put in this code?  All right  so now if they put this code on some piece of hardware and I'm just saying it's layman's terms like  When do we put this stuff into place to where we can reap the benefits of quantum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the challenge is well this exists Google has a quantum computer. I think well it has that  IBM has a quantum computer I  Believe Lockheed Martin has their own but they may be sharing with Google. Okay, these are  Billions, I don't know how much a quantum computer like these are these are so research like they cost a lot of money  They're they're they're  Persnickety to use I don't know why I'm doing this gesture  We're talking about solely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The volume

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Increments so this is this is not a computer that like you can have access to yet  Are there universities with quantum computers?  I feel like the US government's concerned that China has like secret quantum computers in and they they they operate at subzero  temperatures, that's  like  They're not they're not ready for even close to commercialization. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just like I said I just think about all of these capabilities and say hey we when we figure out quantum computing  We can do ABC or D and then you get an article that says hey we figured it out  So my next question is when are we going to do ABC indeed at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so Sundar talks about this and where he said that that he was talking with Hartmut Nevin  Who leads the quantum team along with John Martinez?  The chiefs hardware scientist for Google and then he told me dropped out of his PhD in material science  People around him were working on high-temperature superconductors. That was 26 years ago  I was sitting in the lab and I'm like, wow  This is gonna need a lot of patients to go through so he leaves and goes and becomes wildly, you know  Rich rain Google God bless him  He said I felt like I didn't have that kind of patients  I have deep respect for the people in the team who stayed on this journey a long time  Pretty much all fundamental breakthroughs worked that way. You need to have a long-term vision  He then reminisced about how deep blue beat Gary Kasparov in 97 and then we hit being alpha go in  2016 you think the one hand well, that's a long time, but the  Progress to get there is incredible, right? No, I get that long-term view  Then no, it's not gonna happen next week the butterfly wing to the storm. We're not gonna figure out but  You know if you're a scientist like like these folks are just seeing that  The road you're on also. I think what's really important here that he mentions is they see the end of Moore's law coming and  They're I think worried about it. Okay, because that's what that's what enables their they're like, oh, we're gonna hit the hit the dead end  Continue yeah, well, yes, but they need to continue growth  Sundar says Moore's law is what made Google possible. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But can it run do  crisis

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the chat room has some really good things  He or she I don't know adds that we don't have to worry about breaking encryption until we get to a thousand cubits  I have not fact-checked this but I'll say okay and  They pointed out that IBM will let you  Run a quantum algorithm if you want to write one  On one of their developer computers for free but it only has five cubits and so  So that's not useful then right? No, it could be useful. It depends on what you want to do  I mean quantum computing is just again. It's like walking versus driving a car  You could do things walking like normal computers walk quantum computers are cars. Okay, so  Remember before there were cars. We had a very different worldview. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure did just give me another horse is what they said. Yeah, so I got you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and I don't know I'm like I had this vision that Elon Musk has a quantum computer in his bathroom  Why would you put it in your battery reads the news just to show off it's kind of a humblebrag thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's tweeting from space

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He tweeted from space today that's that's a real story. Yes. Oh really?  That wasn't Carstens fantasy, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the rundown

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there we go. Elon sends tweet via SpaceX's Starlink satellite brought explain something to me here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miss Stacy Wigginbotham  Alrighty  How can't with all that distance? How to can they get the speed and the latency is so low this beat high latency low

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's have to go that far. I'm assuming it's a what spectrum are they using hold on  I haven't paid much attention to these because I feel like they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  full of crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes  So I don't the answer is I don't know in this particular case usually when you want to boost your speeds or  Reduce you can't really reduce your latency unless you get closer, but you can increase your capacity and to do that  what you do is you  Wide in the area that you're willing to use  To send the bits down I don't know how to explain this without like  Just just be you you go ahead just be you you be you but but wait because I don't I  I  Literally don't know what spectrum they're using if they're like what band they're using and all of this so this is hard for me  Okay  But if I read it I can come back to you and tell you in this week's episode of stump Stacy. Wow, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see this often

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explain broadly how satellites tend to work. I cannot explain. Let's see where well, how about how about this? We'll take a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you know, maybe that's enough time to read. Yeah  Don't worry about it  It's all good. You're off the hook Stacy  All right. Let's take a break this episode of this week and Google is brought to you by Zapier  You probably already know this maybe maybe you've experienced this yourself, but growing a business is hard. It's not easy  You don't want to be wasting hours every day moving data from emails over to spreadsheets to your CRM to wherever you need it  to go  That should just kind of happen and with technology that should be easy. Well now is happier  You can it does become easy Zapier can actually help with that  Zapier has over  1500 plus apps and is the easiest way to automate your work  So you can focus on what matters most and that's connecting all of your business software to things like engaging your leads instantly  Also automatically importing new customers maybe notifying your team about opportunities  Really the sky's the limit your imagination can run wild. That's because Zapier is  Super customizable. They support multi-step zaps now  So the possibilities are virtually endless  You can build the solution that you need in minutes  No more wasting your time on tasks that you know could be automated because that's exactly what Zapier was built to do  Just go to Zapier comm slash twig  Then you can go in there and connect the apps that you use the most and let Zapier take it from there best of all  It's easy to build the exact solution you need in minutes without writing code  You're not going in there, you know writing code or anything. You aren't gonna need to ask a developer for help  It's all super straightforward and made for you to understand it right away  So join more than four point five million people who are saving an average of 40 hours per month by using  Zapier we're using it here in-house  One of the things that I've I'm so familiar with is moving my transcripts or the  transcript for the teleprompter  For tech news weekly and you know  It's usually like save out of Google Docs rename the file move it over to the drop box that appears here  And Zapier makes it an automated process. So I love that I could just set that up  That the Micah actually, yeah  Sergeant that's a Micah don't take his credit. No, no, no, I would not want to take his credit  But I love that you can and then you can do that  Micah's actually had a lot of experience with Zapier prior to them being on the network. So  It's it's cool. He's kind of passing down the knowledge make more time to grow your business right now through November  Try Zapier free by going to Zapier comm slash twig. That's Z a P I E R  Comm slash twig for your free 14 day trials app here.com  slash twig and  Check it out for yourself. We think Zapier for their support of this week in Google  All right, I can answer your question boom boom boom checking in with Stacey on the answer to the question  Stacey once we find the right camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so the latency numbers are as I suspected how close they are to the earth  So you just simply don't have to go as far the SpaceX satellites are going to be launched at about let's see  Gotta open up the file  1100 to 1300 kilometers above the earth an in Marsat satellite is  35,000 kilometers above the earth. So that's a lot of miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's like 1300 kilometers and miles is 807 miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, 807 versus 22,000 miles  so  big difference, right  So that's how latency is affected when we do the show over this connection  Um, I don't know cuz are all the satellites how many of them are actually launched

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the other thing is he's gonna have like it's gonna be there's gonna be no sunlight. He's gonna have so many of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  25 seconds  They're talking about 25 seconds of latency or is it milliseconds?  The seconds be bad. Yeah, I was like right if it's 25  Good  When do we I thought it was was it person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't see sometimes on the show. Yeah, 25 milliseconds is not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not good for robotic surgery a latency of 20 milliseconds is normal for VoIP calls a latency of even 150  Milliseconds is barely noticeable  Tada now we know. Okay. Thank you Google and  The capacity is because there are so many of these things and  The sea change that has happened here is that let's see  It used to cost a lot of money  It used to cost, you know  A couple million 25 million to launch a satellite and satellites themselves cost a lot of money with the small cube  Kind of you get a bunch of bunch at the same time  He's already launched a couple and he has permission to deploy up to 11,943  And if you install that space junk  Is it that is a wonderful question MIT Tech Review if you google those two things space debris MIT Tech Review  They had someone answer that question just this week  Currently I currently there are only 22

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2500 satellites in orbit  So this is a lot more satellites than

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yet that he currently has and now we're down than most satellites so we'll get in the way of like the space shuttle. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't hear you can't hear you no, I was talking about all the satellites that exist  Right in Toto  Like all the satellites that have ever been launched is that are in space now is 25,000  so he wants to have five times as many satellites as our  Currently out there Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and one of the big challenges with these like smaller started smaller satellites and the  startup operators that are coming out for this is  What's gonna happen to that stuff when it starts to degrade and break down or what happens if those companies got a business?  So like yes, the satellite industry is fraught with bankruptcies, right?  But throughout those they've operated and made sure their satellites don't run into other satellites and that's actually a continuous process  so  How this is handled I really don't know but it is a legitimately interesting question that people should be and probably are thinking of  I'm just not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got other things to worry about leave it to Elon Musk he'll figure it out  Cool I'm happy that we could get there  No one's half the battle that's what they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked the question. It's my fault. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here. What else do we got we got?  Feel like we've got some little looking bits and pieces or around Google. We've got stadium  Sorry the five the five dual connect. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah down in the Android blog. Yeah, so  Phi is gonna get an upgrade Google Phi a new upgrade called dual dual connect technology as Jeff said  This essentially means that the five devices  Starting with the pixel 4 it's gonna roll out eventually to other five devices  But for right now just the pixel 4 will be able to connect to two networks at once for faster switching  This doesn't mean that data is gonna be faster  Because it can only listen to two networks at once. It's not using them both at the same time. Although that would be pretty cool  But I imagine if it was using a both at the same time then you would would that be like a two data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Data plans. It's like those days. Yeah when you used to yeah, it's like the backpacks that Leo when Leo was broadcasting  I view southwest. Oh, yeah  I'm yeah like rear four sims, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right  Right, so I don't know that five would necessarily say hey, we'll double it and we won't charge you anything extra for that  That seems seems costly if they were to do that, but this doesn't do that anyways  So yeah, so this would be for I guess a faster handing or handoff  Handshake. Yeah, you won't notice it from one to the other. It's pretty slick. So yeah, it's a nice feature  I haven't been using fine a while. I am using mint mobile  They are a sponsor on the network and I imported my number over to mint  So I've been off of five for a little while, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember you doing that and you've I know you've been pretty happy with I've been super happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean features like this, you know are nice  Yeah, especially especially something like this is nice to hear that that it's improving and everything  All right. Is anyone here still using fire?  Never been on fire you've never been on fire  Jeff you use it for for your national internationally  Yeah, yeah, if I makes a lot more sense for someone like you is doing a lot of travel  Didn't make as much sense for me. I was in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Columbia and my AT&T wouldn't  Connect to the network. I've spent two hours in the phone with AT&T and finally got a connect for data and never voice  So I'm really glad I had the separate phone, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually liked fine  I like this the kind of in-app support that sort of stuff  Mm-hmm  But I just I felt like there were certain features that were just kind of lost on me  but then I did just go to Victoria British Columbia a couple of weeks ago and  Didn't have well, I say it only to point out that I didn't have a data connection there. Oh  And if I had five, I think I would have been fine  And if I had five  So, you know I could I could have added it if I wanted to but I didn't I didn't need to my life  Had had the plan so we just used her phone. But so there are there are benefits for sure  I know this is interesting. So right now going on in the Bay Area is the Android Developer Summit  What's happening right now? It's kind of the cool the talk if Google I O is the tick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, then and of summit is the talk for developers. I'll try mentioning that was that I saw Virginia Pultrack mentioned this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This morning. Yeah, Google announced they basically gave an update on trouble trouble is of course the  the components of Android there they're kind of effort to speed up the updating of these devices by by  componentizing parts of the OS and  You know, this was introduced I think at this point three years ago, I believe off the top of my head  so we're starting to kind of  Wonder, you know, is this actually making a dramatic effect on Android devices being updated which is just constantly  Such a such a huge deal  So they announced that this year 12 OEMs just one example of how trouble is helping this year 12 OEMs  Participated in the Q beta that was up from seven OEMs for PI so they're increasing  ability for OEMs lowering the bear the the boundaries and the barriers for OEMs to  Offer the Q beta so they say that's as a result of of trouble, but this is kind of a little more interesting  They said in 2018 Android 8 was on 8.9 percent of all phones right before PI was released  So basically think of it as Android 8 was out almost a year in 2018 and they were it was at 8.9 percent of all devices  And that is pathetic. Yeah  Same same time period for Android 9 before 10 was released  and  It was at 22.6 percent of devices  So then think of that as Android 9 a year later was on  22.6 percent of devices still not great though still not great but an improvement  You're right still not great like  One year after an OS is released 22.6 percent total advice devices. It needs to be so much better than that  I really hope that that continues to into Google's credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is working out this is working out perfectly with its January 2020  Mandate of you know any of these new OEM devices have to be ready to go  With the latest version of Android hints forth and forever more  So we'll probably see that number of much a little bit higher next year hopefully so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 7.0 took 18 months to reach that position of 22.6 percent  so  And other other improvements Samsung as one example started its 10 rollout on October 12th last year  It was November 15th. So Google's just pointing to and then also one plus and  essential  What's really happening with essential a couple of handful of manufacturers that are getting their updates out almost on the same day  That Google's releasing its updates. So that's all really positive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but that's still sort of niche. Yes, totally, you know, yeah things really do  What's happening with all of these Samsung devices out there that are you know still lagging behind  That are capable of running the updated OS, you know, right happening with those devices. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you help me understand something? I'm trying to I was thinking back to the whole Nexus premise of Google  Okay, miss miss Stacy or mr. Jarvis if you all know as well  Was the premise of the Nexus line  umpteen years ago  just a way to sort of set a standard of what Android is supposed to be like and what the OEMs are supposed to  Try to you know aim for far as when they made their their phones and made their  Their software to sort of mimic whatever Google's pure Android was is that was that the premise of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a reference design  For a hardware but also really a folk because everyone was sticking out the sploteware on the phone and Google was kind of like  Right. Okay  Yeah, that was the first Nexus you did. I was at the event so I got it  I was like it was the first phone event I ever covered  I happen to be in San Francisco and  again chip reporter wireless spectrum reporter not the actual device reporter and they were like  Almost like I don't want to go you go and I was like  Okay, I was so nervous I was just like I don't know how to do device coverage  I don't know what to write about. I don't know what to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just open the box Stacey. That's all you do is open the box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, that's kind of how I felt. What did you think? What was your impression of the Nexus one with a little rolly ball at the bottom?  Dude, I don't even remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That much of a depression I mean  Yeah, I'm like I can't I can't even remember my first like non  My first non screen phone. I'm like there was a BlackBerry Pearl in there and beyond that and I had a motor razor at one  Time but beyond that no, oh the Motorola razor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I think we've got a segue  Motorola  Just put out a tease for an upcoming phone reveal November 13th and  They had a little animation is doing this little foldy thing  They threw out all sorts of little key key points in the invitation  Saying a highly anticipated unveiling of a reinvented icon  you're going to flip an original unlike any other and  Pretty certain this is Motorola's foldable take of the  Motorola razor the original razor the flip razor that everybody had  Yay, so and I never had one  I never actually had a  Motorola razor, but I did I did want one that was the very first phone. I bought Queen Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow very she like that one  She she loved it until everybody started getting into the smartphones and they were texting faster than her yes, I'm saying this on air

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just remember it was really satisfying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hanging up on people that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when when was the razor how long what year was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that? It's got to be 2003 2004 more along oh fours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So first release November 2005  No, that's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might be right so I was thinking about oh four that might be right actually it might actually be 2005

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the v3 was the first one and it was introduced in July of 2004  But then the v3i with iTunes built in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah  iTunes on a Motorola phone  Yeah, and I also remember a lot of people like like it was such a hot phone  Like everybody wanted one of those things and then at some point I started noticing there were these little air vents  Near the displays that when you would have the phone in your pocket little pocket fuzz would get in there  And it would line the inside display and everything and it was her the luster started  Hopefully Motorola has has has taken care of those issues for the new upcoming Motorola

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Foldable razor, but any interest I'm old enough that anything this century seems recent to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's still that new phone by Motorola yeah 2005 oh yeah, that was yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you want to put it in context I always realize this but like when I had my daughter it was 2006 and  There were like no smartphones because I remember being like I you know, I was nursing so I had nothing  I didn't have a Kindle. I had to like  Right, and then  2007 was the first iPhone so like so soon after that people were just like why do you say you were bored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We throw every speed bump we throw in your way  It's true every pothole every rabbit hole every rat hole you somehow manage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somehow like it to make it to the end  Yeah, I'm sure we've missed something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We missed what we missed was that people are having fits about well Google gave me free storage all this time  No, they charged me for storage. Oh, right the Bloomberg article  that I as someone pointed out that's exactly what the entire news industry did but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Oh, it's also a popular tactic with drug dealers right to get you hooked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Stacey they get you hooked and then 15 years later they start charging for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so I will say because I actually I wasn't worried about charging cuz I but I did go delete my emails from like  2005 all the way through  2010 I think no  2009 I stopped in 2009 and did you archive those before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just deleted like later I don't care I don't want to walk down memory lane

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll probably go back to 2010 and anything prior to that because it's pointless

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I freed up probably three or four gigs of memory easily. I mean, there's no need there's I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find things in search that can especially what happens to your memory like an old man like me  I see that I met that person back at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of like if I met you in 2005, can I really claim some sort of kinship on you? No  We met back in 2005. You don't remember. I don't remember but my email says it happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now if I'm in Gmail, how can I find out where my smore my storage is  Used to be at the bottom left, but I don't think it's there anymore. I'll tell you that guy  Dadgummit indeed  Yeah, I'm not finding it. I don't see it online either. I want to know cuz I haven't I  Haven't reached the point  Well, I'll be no one used to be right there on the front page. You couldn't miss it now  They don't want you to know they just want to spring the the message for you  When you when you're about to go over  Apparently, they don't make it easy for you to find  Or maybe it's somewhere else  Yeah, I have a hard time  Thinking about deleting old emails. I kind of like don't think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the same way, but I've gotten to a point now. It's like  What am I going to do with this, you know 20 years from now? It's not even useful now  It's probably not gonna be useful another five years from now. So just go ahead and just cut it off get it out of my head  You know enough there's certain things like documents or whatever  Yeah, I'll keep that but just random messages. No, they can go  They can go especially if I don't hear from these people regularly and nothing  But every once in a while I end up doing a search for some random thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I look through the results and I see that there's something in there from like 2000. I don't know  So this is early on  I remember that email and I actually do remember writing that email in my  That's why I said about 2010 because I've done some searches like that to where I'm just looking for something in particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it I guess metadata has it connected somehow and it pulls up something from like 2010  I'm like, oh, yeah, I did write that so but I'll keep it but anything beyond that now, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it's a function of the type of person you are. Like I don't keep I don't keep anything  I have like I'm like, eh, I don't care get rid of it. That's my wife. She can't keep anything  My husband everything has to have a container. I swear

No, it's a memento and I was like  Honey, this is trash  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before but when I met my wife she was unimpressed by discovery that kitchen cabinets were the exact right size to store copies of the New York Times  No, she wasn't very patient they were gone quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, you can log into dry I knew I could see this somewhere and thank you  I believe bleak put it in the chat room live log just log into drive.google.com and you'll see in the bottom left-hand  Corner you'll see your storage right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This time I did not have a thing that I've you know  Popped in my head or what have you because of something I come across during my musings of this here internets  but I  Did want to give a shout out to our triangulation show these last two have just been  fascinating especially this one here with miss Ruja Benjamin and  She's talking about her book race after technology and it really really struck a nerve when we you know  We can go back about a month or so where we were looking at AI and how it just falsely identified to me as a wrongdoer  In all of that jazz  But her book is sounding great. I started reading it a couple weeks ago and it it really does open your eyes  From all different perspectives as she breaks down what's going into all of this technology and what people are  Are feeling when they're subjected to some of these technologies even like when they didn't even ask to be subjected to these technologies  Think of the homeless folks right that were used as part of the tools  But that episode and then the episode prior to that  Mr. Micah Sargent interviewed I can't remember her name now, but she was she was talking about waste and garbage and  Kate O'Neil Kate O'Neil and I'm sitting here in in in Petaluma  Living here now, and I've been battling with recycling and recycling the right way and they're fussing at me and telling me  I'm not recycling right and the whole thing I had no idea how much went into it  But Miss Kate O'Neil discussed a lot more in depth and how a lot of the stuff especially with Amazon  We love getting our packages. Yeah, but they are the worst offenders  When it comes to handling and recycling  The products that we get it's it's those two shows  Triangulation I've already been a big fan of it  But those two shows right there have really hit me in the heart recently number one because I'm living here and experiencing in the number two  That whole AI thing is still a mess. It's got a ways to go. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's awesome twit TV slash TRI or twit TV slash. I think triangulation works as well. Mm-hmm  Yeah, we're all pitching in on triangulation. Mike has done it. I'll be in there soon.

Thank you Jerry Ellsworth for this Friday  Which for a great interview that we recorded on Monday about her  Project tilt 5 which is an augmented reality kind of tabletop board game thing. That's really neat  So there's a great interview. So that's gonna be this Friday as well. I'm forward to it. Yeah, it's a great show  It's awesome to be able to have the opportunity to just talk with people  Yeah, things that they focus on their passions all that kind of stuff. They're so freakin smart. Yes  smart indeed  Stacey, what's your thing? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have a service because I'm crazy. I've been trying out the Nike training club premium  and if you if you're gonna guess I am gonna try the Fitbit premium next because  Because I'm crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  testing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  exactly  So this is I think it's 1599 a month  And I I think I've recommended the Nike training club app before if I haven't I tell random people about it because it is like  Wonderful for people who travel because I have lots of bodyweight exercises  and  I'm just gonna warn you though  Nike premium is not for  Casual people wimps I would say it's not even for casual people  So I have historically found that I'm a I'm a fairly fit person  I'm not like running marathons, but I do keep active and etc, right?  The Nike anything above beginner or intermediate  So the advanced workouts, I I can't even do them like it's sometimes very discouraging when you're like they're like, here's the warm-up  And you're like I'm dead now  Don't know what's happening to my body  But they have like  The the classes they have added with premium are really awesome  I do find it  Motivational in a way like if you're gonna do peloton if you're gonna spend three thousand dollars on a mirror  Then this is not for you. But if you just want like a quick and easy  Way to work out you can start with the free app, which has plenty of great workouts  But if you want to do like a program or something  They're actually quite motivational  I've tried to if their programs and I like both of them and they're a  Huge variety of bodyweight ones and then there's a huge variety of ones that are like 30 minutes or less  so  Hey, nice. So that's so  Yeah, if you're if you've never exercised before this may not be the best one for you  But if you want to challenge yourself, this is a very challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Way to go. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great because that was gonna be my next question  Could anybody just pick this up and give it a go but you you don't think the the beginner should grab this just yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like if you are a true beginner  Unless you're like a true beginner you're like 20 in your 20s  Maybe you could do it. But like if you were older than that, I feel like you could probably get hurt. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Transcript:  I'm from Chick-fil-a country. So I'm like well, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Endorse what happened in the UK to Chick-fil-a. Yeah  You heard about that, right? No  They opened they opened a store within a week. It's closed because the protests against Chick-fil-a in the UK  The number I do is this the room does this is  There was a study of 40 million trips on uber to find out what people's tips are  and  I don't know about you but I tip every time and I was upset when uber didn't have tips and now it has tips  That's for a long time  60% of writers never tip  Percent always tip those who tip leave an average of three dollars this for Washington Post story about the study  And  Somebody pointed out they don't they don't have to know what happens offline if you give cash that's not included  But I can't imagine there's a lot of that  if  You know who the writer is you can guess the tip  Regardless of trip or driver quality. In other words tipping is determined by the writer not the driver which I guess that's good news  Women tip 14% 14.3 percent of the time men tip  17% of the time that surprised the heck out of me one guess is because women may feel that they're not treated very well in ubers  I don't know  Men tip 12% more if their driver is a woman which may be good or maybe bad. I don't know  The premium men pay to women behind the wheel shrinks as the women get older well that answers the question as to whether that's good or bad  That's bad by the time the drivers reach 865 it is virtually vanished  Women also tip other women more, but they don't significantly change their tips based on the drivers age  Women always being nicer than men  So that's I found that all pretty darn fascinating and said
