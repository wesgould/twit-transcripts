Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we realized I need to get on your IRC channel I need to get a name and I am on chat but oh that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as you have a name register it and then tell the mods and then that way you will be the only  Whatever Stacey on IOT is always good. You could do that. That's what you're there. We go. I am the only Stacey on IOT  Yeah, it always looks like on riot like you're rioting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's better than idiot, which is what other people told no no I'll take it no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's rioting hey look who else is here from e3 of all things Mike Elgin is back in the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right the United States of America

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have to come back like a certain number of days a year or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really I have to leave other countries because of various requirements one of the which is Schingen in Europe where three months  In any of those countries you have to leave all of those countries. That's okay  US doesn't really care about that stuff you can go abroad for two years and they don't okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz as long as they get your taxes  There's no issue on residency just keep paying us taxes. That's all we care right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, welcome. Welcome back. You first time it will live abroad. That's right. I'm not a big gamer guy  But I was in LA already planning to be in LA and I thought I'd check out the shows a lot of fun  and of course  Virtual reality is just the hottest thing there just about for the attendees. I think some of the games are the  You know the hotly  Anticipated games are important, but for me, it's all the VR  It's you know, you always hear that VR is not going to be just a gamer thing  Well, don't tell the e3 people because as they're doing some really amazing things with you are there. I think in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really VR is where gaming is where VR shines the best we haven't yet  Got the technology to do augmented reality, which would be the more useful for business and for user interface and  You know, I don't know if immersive is that interesting unless you're in interactively engaged as in a game  So I think it's really is for gaming. It's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Simulations in education, but yeah, have you seen anybody do that yet?  Simulations Air Force. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the Air Force you're right actually good point. Okay, I take it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read about a medical  Service, but I can't I'll look for it and see if I can find it doing like doctor training in VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just gonna say that one big application that people aren't prepared for in VR is  Social socializing but that would require connection and if Skype's in any  Any indication of how good the connections are going to be then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never mind. I have the people who have tried because you can't really do it right now  but I  Want to say that Oculus has a social network where you?  This is coming someday where you could be in the same  Space with another Oculus Rift user and the people have tried that say it's really cool like throwing a ball even throwing a ball  Back and forth, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know one thing I do definitely want to say about the general realm of VR  Augmented reality and so on and I was heavily persuaded by Kevin on this point  Which is that up until now from the dawn of the computing revolution until now?  computing and then later the internet has all been about information and  We're entering into this new long era era where computers and the internet are all about experiences instead of information  It's a subtle difference, but it's a big one and VR is gonna have a huge impact on that  For example, we're always talking about you know, do you have to travel for business?  Travel to go to a trade show or whatever  well you you often do and because you want the experience of meeting face to face the experience of being there in in real life and  Increasingly the internet and VR and augmented reality will be delivering experiences of all kinds  Not just games not just business meetings  But any kind of experience you want to have and it will get to the point where information is less important and experiences are far  More important. I thought it was a really interesting point by Kevin Kelly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's usually got a pretty good handle on all this stuff. I don't know I'm flashing back to second life and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the excitement we had about telecommuting yet we still haven't changed our ways very much so I I  Think there are definitely benefits for this, but I don't know if we're gonna suddenly stop meeting people face to face  For professionals purposes or to sell things. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Put I'm be honest with you  well  I got really excited when we got our oculus rift and played with a lot and then the vibe and played with a lot I  noticed that  The same thing has happening to me with VR that has happened with many other technologies that seemed cool and didn't end up being I  Didn't end up getting traction and I'd include Google Glass in this  It I'm not convinced that VR is gonna be as big as everybody seems to think I think  For one thing you spend a lot of time in it like more than half an hour  You really get some negative effects not just nauseous nausea, but  Disorientation afterwards and things weird things happen you feel weird  It isn't you know, I think it's not fun for the long hauls kind of like 3d movies that it's cool at first  And then but doesn't after two hours you kind of wish you hadn't well a couple of things on that Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of them is those are the problems that remain to be solved from a technology perspective  There are many potential ways to increase the comfort level decrease the disorientation  Decrease nausea and all that kind of stuff and of course companies are working on it  The other one is that there's a whole world of more casual easier to swallow kinds of  realities especially augmented reality of the kind that magic leap and HoloLens and others are working on and this is a I think this  Huge place and we're already seeing it kind of sort of with Google's project Tango which just released a series of videos  demonstrating a very  Palatable form of augmented reality, of course  Which is where you're looking at a phone smartphone screen in the case of Tango potentially eventually a tablet, but that's a very  friendly form of of  Readjusted reality where you see things in the camera lens that you don't actually see in real life  And you can do that for hours without any disorientation tang. Yeah, because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, you both you and Stacey if you believe in Tango, you're gonna have to convince me on there  Here's the here's some of the video. This is a tango new kind of phone. This is the new Lenovo  Phone it looks to me very much like augmented reality. We had augmented reality browsers on Android years ago  Yeah, and they never went much anywhere. This is an obviously it's an advertisement as you're seeing your kids a kid's got  What I think is cool. He has set up dominoes, you know, one of those big domino  Rube Goldberg machines and it's all it's so cool. And now there's a kid going to a museum  But for some reason during this all is he's not in the light. There's he's carrying a flashlight with him  I'm not sure. I'm not very good. Okay. Thank you. Now he's a school

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't really show and he's in the gym and he's shining a flashlight on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some science project and I guess the idea okay, let me get out of this one because this is just this doesn't sell you  All right. Finally, he's using tango. So now instead of  Looking at a dinosaur he's looking at the dinosaur through it phone that he's holding up or he's looking at his dominoes through a  Phone. I didn't even have to build it. Isn't that great?  He could just walk down the stairs and pretend he built it. It feels like not an improved

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a terrible video and I think you know the the benefit of tango  We realize when artificial intelligence is applied  Meaning that the imagery will identify the objects that it's scanning as they're scanning  So and instead of a surface that drops off at the end. Oh, that's a that's a table, right?  Kind of like the hollow table. There's an under the exactly  Yeah, so the augmented reality apps that we've had so far will project something that appears to be there  But it doesn't know what it's projecting upon so with project tango something can only sit on the table but go behind the table

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean Stacy that when you prefer that your kid builds the dominoes or looks at it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would although so a are I I think it has certain applications  I hate holding up a phone in front of me like the less I need to phone to mediate my world the better  But you know again, I've seen stuff for like you think about it industrial  Where you're like looking at like a complex part and you're showing this and saying oh, hey, this is this is what these are  This is the problem and you can see how to fix it. Well, here's an example. This is another one of the ads  This is a mom and daughter planning her new bedroom. Oh, yeah, and that was yeah design is always a fun one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's yeah, I mean it's fun and I guess if you're planning a bedroom to be able to see the bed  See the wall color see the paint

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a really cool commercial kind of application building IKEA furniture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and in your bedroom, I really don't want to see kids doing this with their dominoes though  I mean, this is like and this dad by the way, this dad is annoying. This is like  Creepy dad dad get off your phone. Do your kids do this to you?  Stacey or your husband get off the phone and pay attention. We're in the real world  No  No, although you know what this is like my kids like no my kids used to do that all the time get off your blackberry dad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you ever play any of those games that came with the Sphero? Yeah  Again, this is exactly like that. Yeah for about a minute, right? Well, no, I'm not saying again this I'm  The place where this is most useful is industrial where you could send someone who's not well trained in something to like fix something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean the other thing is that everything that's happening on a smartphone screen  I mean you you're you're perceiving that you know  Follow Moore's law into the future five years and this is going to be and not Google Glass type of clunky dorky  Glasses but in glasses that look like regular glasses. I think that within within five years  It'll be simply an option when you go to the optometrist office or go to sunglasses hot to get the smart version  And they can they can drip into your eyeballs  Whatever it is you want to see and once you can wear glasses that look like socially acceptable glasses normal glasses and into those glasses you can beam  Something like HoloLens where you see things that aren't there  Another another word for that is insanity. But anyway  That's that's going to be amazing because you'll be you know, it'll be super sci-fi ish, you know, you'll be like, you know  I'll be one your only hope and you'll see it. Nobody else will see or hear it and  I think that will be very powerful. It's a visual form of  Information that is not just words and not just static pictures  But objects that appear in the in the 3d space that you're inhabiting you were joking about insanity Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But actually that's one of the theories about why people are nauseated when they use VR  Is because of a difference between the focal length and the and where your eyes are converging  In other words your focus muscles are set your focusing muscles are saying something six feet away  Your eyes are converging at something just a few inches away. Yeah that disconnect tells our  Primitive mind something seriously wrong. Probably you ate some bad mushrooms and throw up now  And that's a theory of course, but that's that's the theory behind  VR nausea  Is that that you're there is a kind of insanity your mind says this is not right  Something's wrong here and we'd have and that overcoming that is not a matter of improving frame rate  Or reducing latency. It's it's kind of biological. So that's the other thing  I still the jury's still out on that one as well. Yeah, right  I think Mike you might be living in the matrix in five years and I'm not sure I want to join you  See now that I would do see I'm not sure I want to join you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said second life if you could jack in and be in that yeah, then I might do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't you want to do that? Stacey?  No, anything involving actual literal jacking in I'm a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drawing the line. Okay. Well, the good news is that Elon Musk says we're already there. We're in the simulation  So this would be a simulation inside the simulation. I think Elon Musk is a little bit of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Stacey this doesn't appeal to you particularly or it does I don't think it I think it's kind of crazy talk from a tech perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I mean if you yes things will get smaller  But the type of thing you're talking about we have to do much more to I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Radios and antennas because this has to be connected to something, right?  So we have to get that out there and then we have to do it in a way that's not just a  I mean radios and antennas because this has to be connected to something right? So we have to get those smaller  We have to make them biologically  Compatible with possibly our eyeballs  We're talking about screens. So we've got to figure out like screen size and how to do that  and I'm not saying we won't ever get there, but I  Feel like Mike you're being really optimistic  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just all I'm really doing is just if you you know  The way that William Gibson always predicted so accurately the future back in the 80s  Right was he would he would read these obscure trade journals and find out where everything was going and it would see where all those  things if you combine the future of everything you get a pretty accurate future and I think that  The fact is that people love I I've been wearing Bluetooth headphones a lot these days and I've been trying to channel my  my sort of  Notifications and things like that to audio so I can hear it and just walking around having this world  You know the world of the internet and the computer in communication all that kind of stuff privately  Whispering in my ear all the time. I think people are going to want that visually and if you follow Moore's law  We're certainly going to have the the hardware and the software the question's law hit a wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe not by the way, there's a story that you're getting better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gallium arsenide doping we may be able to crack that wall yet again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if we want to talk about doping I can go there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to push that on the stack because there's about three different things coming up here for me now that I do  Want to talk about what so let me say this that it's  It is one thing for William Gibson. He's a storyteller  So it's a wonderful thing for him to be able to tell stories that are credible futuristic stories  But as a journalist, I always felt like my job was to try these as a tech journalist or tech punnet  My job was to try these new technologies and really try to suss out which ones were worth paying more attention to and which ones  were just gimmicks and and I mean, let's be honest the  Odds are that most of them are gimmicks a lot of this stuff  Just doesn't stick and I feel like while I'd love to be a cheerleader. That's not exactly my job. My job is to kind of  Be a little brutal and say, you know, this isn't something that's going anywhere  This is something that's going and I and I admit I I'm torn on VR. I was very excited when I first started using it  Yeah, but I'm concerned that there are some indicators it may not be all that  I think augmented reality is pretty cool  And that's what you're describing Mike when you go and you get special glasses or even augmented reality doesn't have to be visual  It's what you're talking about when you're using your Bluetooth headset  Or when you have the mushrooms or the and I'm not that there's anything wrong with mushrooms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just wouldn't want to wear them all day and the other thing that is interesting about virtual reality when you talk about  Multimedia word that nobody has said for 20 years  Is the is the coming world of?  Earbuds that let you fine-tune exactly what you hear and exactly what you don't hear and those will be not only piping in  music and podcasts and so on but they'll also be filtering out this crying baby and and  Turning up the you know the information you want to hear and that's going to be really really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To some extent I'm already doing that with my hearing aids, you know, I got yes those Starkey Halo hearing aids and it does some really  Nowadays hearing aids are not just amplifiers  That's what you don't hear the grandpa's ringing hearing aid anymore because really what they are is DSPs and they do a lot of processing  including trying to figure out where the sounds coming from and  Using the stereo earphones to give you more directional information  To know where you're looking and to make that guy talk louder than the guy over here lots of really interesting stuff  I just got a  Upgrade notice from my audiologist  He says we've got new cones  We're gonna put in that make music sound better  and by the way  one of the things I do with my hearing aids is I  stealthily walk down the street and listen to my book because you can't tell that I'm listening to a book and my hearing aids and  Getting notifications and all that stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why hearing aids are gonna be obsolete because everyone will already have them by the time they're old enough to wear here  They're gonna be in-ear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right devices of some kind. Yeah near connections to the internet  Yeah, well, and I think that that is by the way one solution  To the nausea problem and other things is that you doesn't have to be visual  It can be auditory and I think you made a great point Mike  In fact, really a lot of what Google Glass was was auditory as much as visual. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a hybrid of virtual and augmented reality that would require a project Tango type of technology and that is that you know  Everything you see is fake. It's monsters and and alien landscapes and so on but that it matches the surfaces of the actual place where you are  So when you're looking around and you're walking around or you're not walking around or whatever it makes sense with exactly what you're doing and  And so on and and that's something that of course they've demonstrated  with the HoloLens one of the first  Demonstrations was the landscape of Mars. Well, that was really a ground there. It just wasn't a Martian landscape, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it could be HoloLens really could be very interesting, but it's also I believe several years off  Yes. Yes. Yeah, cuz HoloLens the whole PC and the battery and everything are in the band  So you are to truly untethered  Yeah, I don't know  Did you see it III any of these goofy backpack PCs designed for using with the oculus rift so you could walk around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't but they you know  They were there was a lot of very controlled environments for the VR partly because they didn't want people wandering into another  You know cosplayer user with a sword or whatever, but it was it was you know, very controlled environments  I thought well, you know  We're not you can't just strap people into these things yet and have it be a seamless experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So honey, I'm going into my VR pod. Yes. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean this gives new meaning to the man cave

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right or an actual cave the lady. Well, I'm not gonna say you have a lady

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay rewind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From a cultural perspective what's interesting to me is that you know people like us have been talking about the  problems and pitfalls and  Potential virtual reality for a long time but ready player one is gonna come out as a movie. It's a Steven  It is and in fact the guy from you know  Bachman from Silicon Valley has already signed on to play a troll in that movie  It's it's probably going to be a fantastic movie  It'll probably be a blockbuster and it'll get everybody talking about what happens when people abandon the real world for the virtual one  and and it's a it's a you know, I'm super concerned about this because it clearly you know  I'm concerned about people who live in horrible places that want to live in wonderful places  And they're just vanishing to virtual reality  I think that'll happen for some minority of people kind of already happens with video games  But in ready player one  It's a dystopian future where because everybody's in virtual reality the real world goes to hell and the more the world real world goes to  Hell the more people want to vanish into virtual reality sounds like the presidential election of 26 exactly  Well, imagine if we could just tune it all out and live in a world where some of these candidates didn't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, it's interesting our 13 year old when I was 13 I was very it was  It was a  1968 Nixon versus  Humphrey yeah, yeah fraud with optimism and I was but I was fascinated and  Really engaged. I remember sitting through the contested election contested Democratic election and  Literally writing down delegate votes to keep track of this  I was fascinated then I fast forward to our 13 year old who puts his fingers in the ears if we if there's any politics  Like and I don't blame him  It's like it's complete  I think we at this point people want to put a hood over their heads and not even talk about or think about it  We're partly because we're overloaded right we have media overload  Right, but also partly because the reality is so real. It's a little too real. Yeah at this point  Yeah, you have a nine-year-old almost ten

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey yes. Yes, and she actually understands. Well, of course she understands the election, but she has  thoughts and opinions  Oh good. Oh good. She her entire school she goes to a it's a school modeled after the International School in Mexico City  Oh neat, so they they are pretty anti-trump as a school

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because she were pro-trump would she feel would she be ostracized? She has a friend who's pro-trump and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you are in Texas after all I am I'm in Austin though  people's Republic of Austin  They have a they have a Trump anti-trump dance and her friend doesn't do the dance  But that's about the extent of the ostracist ostracist hard. It'd be hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, especially at that age when you really want to your peer group is everything you really want to be accepted. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're one of those warm and fuzzy schools. Everyone's still accepted. It's all okay. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We're gonna come back. I we are talking about technologies that you know, the mainstream media goes  Oh, this is the next big thing and then those of us who have been covering tech for a while might have other thoughts  Larry pages secret flying car factories  Next coming up next but first a word from our sponsor at Lassian  Comm we use it Lassian now  This is reality at Lassian gives you a window into exactly how your team is doing what they're working on how far along they are  And every different part of a project at Lassian is a series of tools a number of tools that let you work better  Together or as they say team up to create what's next?  We'll start with Jira which many people have first experienced kind of as an agile  Kanban board a way of keeping track of all the different projects managing all the different tasks  We use Jira when we were designing our website the company out of Austin for kitchens that did it  Use Jira for us to keep track with what they're doing for us to create our user stories so they could work on the projects  And it really was fantastic  I mean I just and now we continue to use it for our maintenance contract so we can say here's something we want you  To work on this is next. This is next Jira is the number one software development tool used by agile teams to assign track and manage  tasks for any project and no matter how  Complex and if if you've been on a development team and you've not used your you got to try it because I think you'll see  How incredible it is for getting things done? There's also confluence  Which we use I didn't know this but we use confluence in  In the twit our engineering team uses it to document equipment and work processes  Keep track of where things are in the process confluence  Will let you create and share content organized results bring team members up to speed  We also use hip chat and I you know  I don't know if I want to show you our hip check because it's so active and we use hip chat for  Everything to book guests to plan shows oops. I don't have to create an account. I have an account  For the new studio  We're keeping track of it and Russell and our sys admins use hip chat because they've integrated into hip chat  All of the tools like panoptic that they use to keep an eye on servers and uptime and all of this stuff the integrations are  Incredible in hip chat everything bitbucket github asana google hangouts zendis 150  integrations with more coming all the time so you can keep track of  What's going on in what looks like an instant messenger?  But also allows you video and chat and and just everything you'd ever want  I it's incredible of course hip chat works right with Jira and confluence and bitbucket  Which is their testing and review and managing code in real-time tool lots of great stuff  Here's the deal go to at lassie and comm and find out more about all the great tools that I'll help your team  work together  Helping teams everywhere team up to create. What's next at lassie and  Calm we use it and we love it stacey Higginbotham is here from stacey on iot.com  That's her website and of course the great podcast she does with a friend Kevin Toffle  The iot podcast she's the king or queen of iot  It's always nice to have you and you said your door your doorbell may ring at any time  And you'll leap up and go to the ups guy because what are you waiting for something from underwear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Under armor under armor, okay?  It's their fitness. It's their health box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smoke and deal on it. Oh is it like can you wear like under armor?  And it will tell you how your heart rate is and all that stuff kind of thing. It's three things. It's a scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a connected heart rate monitor the strap kind and a fitness band  And if you want they also have shoes that work with this and the shoes you just run in that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice. So it is you don't have to charge on my htc works with them on that  Yes, yes, they do really really  You know it's it's just everywhere now. You can't you can't exercise alone anymore  They bought they bought all my favorite apps. They bought my fitness pal. They use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love I will say I love their apps map my herb  Map my run map my run. Yes, they did ride  Yeah, my fitness pal with all the food tracking. So Alexa. Oh, I said her name. Sorry the echo has a food tracking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, have you tried that? I'm really excited about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I am too  But I have not tried it because I didn't want to set up an account and then I forgot about it for like two days

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna try it tonight  Because food logging is the single most for me the best way for me to lose weight to be more healthy  I'm already exercising a lot and I do keep track of it  I have my Apple watch on today, but I use a Fitbit and other things  But it's food tracking and it's such a pan up  But if I could get that to work with the echo I would be really like because I'm usually sitting next to the echo when I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eating I'm waiting for like there's an app called meal snap  I don't know why I showed my phone because I would take a picture of your food  Yeah, and it would estimate how many calories were in it and that kind of what I arrived but with  AI where it is and the ability to visualize food. I'm like, why do we not have yeah  that  It wouldn't be as accurate, but I'm okay with that. I just need a general like echo. I know I'm eating something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about the size of my fist is blue green and it smells like prunes  Oh  You're eating. I don't know what  Yes, that guy would say stop eating that whatever it is  I will dial 9-1-1 for you if you don't stop  Mike Elgin is also here. He is a digital nomad. That's the name of his website  He's traveling the world and right now his travels have brought him to the exotic  destination of  Los Angeles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  California, that's right. And yep, and then I'll be in the US for about a month and then we're taking off again  Yeah, it's it's very exciting to be in LA, you know, it's you know, I'm a big foodie Leo  You are too and LA is such a big food town. Now. It's just amazing  We went to a restaurant last night called bestia bestia something like that. What the heck is that?  It's a great restaurant  Downtown it's in a really bad neighborhood. It's worth risking it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh  So the website what is the website for it is coming nomad, right becoming nomad comm yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's a newsletter you can sign up for if you like  It's free and I also have a Twitter account becoming no man

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm always so jealous because this is something I've always wanted to do  Is to you know kick off the traces and and go see the world. Oh  Man, look at this body surfing at Tulum. You've got a life. I'm so jealous. Great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the lifestyle fact that you know, most of it many of us many of us who have people who can work for me  right  If you can work from home, you can work from Rome  so, you know mobile technology enables you to live anywhere and  I would like to see more people doing it if they can and if they want to meet and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you follow Mike on Instagram, you'll be tortured with his food pictures  Facebook is it Facebook or Instagram? I know I see your pictures all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably most I do both but it's probably mostly Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I post a lot more on Facebook and people can follow you without friending you  They can yes, you know what I'm saying. Yeah, I say that I do know I do know a very strange picture of you on your Facebook  announcing your appearance  It's apparently you and Larry Page wearing your Google Glass. It's there's some reason your face is painted with the American flag

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was looking for an arresting image for Facebook. That was a that was actually a selfie that Larry  Page himself took using my camera. He held I was trying to take a selfie with my gigantic  DSLR and he said no, here's how you do it. He grabbed the camera  I mean, it's great hold it upside down and that that American flag was for some Google plus thing from like  Four years ago was a filter or something. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not actually a face

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, you met Larry Page with your face  Humiliating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe not, I don't know can we we we've actually dropped Mike's video and it's the audio is working perfectly  So that's fine. And that's really all we really need but I think we should use this image of Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're gonna talk about the flying cars. We got both. Yeah, that's right. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa my wife came to me a couple of days ago and said this is so exciting  Larry Page is gonna build flying cars and I said exciting. That's a terrifying thought  Do you really want everybody and their brother flying around? So what's the story with flying cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey if you don't mind I wrote a column on this and I'd love

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My frame of reference is the Jetsons and yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and also the flying DeLorean in in back to the future too, and we've got a million of them, you know  And so limit first for for people who are listening to this show  Let me describe the vehicle because we've known about the vehicle and the company for a little while sketchy information  But we've just learned that it's in fact Larry Page is the sole owner of this  Oh, it's not just he's invested in the competitor, right?  Yeah, right. There's Kitty Hawk is a is another company that's invested in and that company the president of that company is  Is the guy who launched the self-driving car initiative?  Sebastian Thrun at Google but the the the one that Larry Page owns outright is really fascinating  The zero airplane so imagine an airplane fuselage just the part where you sit where the motor is and where the wheels are and then on  That and the very back and top there's a wing that curves down in the back and in the very very front  There's another wing that's on the bottom and then there's a sort of two upside-down pontoons on either side and  There are four propellers on each side  That are slightly at different angles and two propellers in the back providing forward thrust

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This looks like something you would see in a Tom Swift novel from 1936

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes the future but this but Larry Page and I've done  I did a lot of research on this and and I hate to say it because I always come up often come across as a  Google fanboy, but Larry Page has the best  so-called flying car  Out there and then here's why yeah, he's got a g6  That's the best flying car a private jet right these little propellers are part of what makes this possible  And the other part is self flying so that star the propeller

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's key by the way the self-flying technologies  Otherwise, you've got people flying into each other above your head. They will never let you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah control an airplane in your neighborhood  It's that it's never gonna happen  But so these these propellers each of it's like a it's like an electric car each of a Tesla each of these  Propellers has its own motor and its own controller  So if one of them gets hit by a bird or one of them goes out for some reason  The plane will keep flying if two or three of them go out the plane will keep flying  It's not depending on one engine or one. That's good on propeller

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very reliable would be a very high priority for something like this if there's hundreds above me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, and one of the most wonderful things about this is he's shooting for the for the mass market  So he's really shooting for an affordable  Airplane that will essentially be  It'll cost as much as a pretty high-end car and so like a hundred thirty hundred fifty something like that  Yeah, I mean I think it could even so here's the thing that a lot of engineers are saying a lot of people who really know  What they're talking about are saying it's actually easier to do a self flying airplane than it is to do a self-driving car  There are less things to crash into you don't have to stay on the road. You don't have to identify  Bicyclists you don't have to do all this you need to avoid, you know, stay in the airspace avoid the telephone poles  You know, it's a much simpler problem  Biggest part of the problem as is often the case with almost any technology is the battery situation and they're heavy  It's particularly problematic in an airplane  But I have a I have a personal problem with the concept of the flying car people think that their car  Will fly the thing that they drive around will fly that will never happen. This is an airplane. You can't drive this like a car  In fact, this is the title of your own. Yeah, it does look like a drone doesn't exactly and of course  There's some other you know, there are a bunch of companies that have tried to do flying cars. They already exist  There's the there's the pal V the sky car the aero mobile 3.0  The Maverick LSA the icon a5 switchblade the lithium jet the  Velocicopter Wow Pegasus SkyRunner Volante  I mean there are a bunch of these one of the coolest one is the terra fugee or for terra Fuji or I don't know how  TF X which is a really cool device  But the ones that will matter are gonna be self-driving and the other thing is just like self-driving cars  I don't think we'll care about owning them  We may be in 10 or 15 years be able to summon one to land on our lawn and take us to dinner or whatever  But we won't necessarily want to own them and they will definitely be self

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  driving they have so Mike help me out here. Yeah, if  Is this for like a family is this for one person?  How do you see this being used and wouldn't we just?  It's kind of like building new highways or new roads where they just get clogged because there's more avenues  I mean, I know that we feel like the air above us is infinite, but it's not so  I'm just trying to think about why I would I mean, it's cool  But why do I need or want this where the what are you crazy?  No, I'm not I'm practical. Remember how George Jetson got stuck in his traffic jeans  Who wouldn't want this again totally cool, but realistically how is this gonna be used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be an uber  You know  I think for most the most a common usage will be that you will use your app to say I need her I need  A I need to get to this place that's 30 miles away and I want to get there in five minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's okay. So number one it would be it would be a lot faster than driving, right? Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those rotors are really that much  I'm just thinking about like the engines on these things because they're electric, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so and they're battery powered and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think they'd be much more reliable frankly. Yeah, it sounds safer unless you actually fall because then you're probably dead but  Like do we know any of the speeds on these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, there's the actual information and by the way, they're already flying prototypes  This airplane the zero airplanes been spotted really at a silicon  Or near Silicon Valley. There's some spy shots out there and they're testing a lot of these concepts  This is this is years and years away. But you know, let's say 15 years into the future  I think it's perfectly reasonable to to just have  Flying cars or these these self-driving airplanes to be landing take you someplace and come back and it won't cost a fortune  It might cost 50 bucks or a hundred bucks or something like that  But I think it'll be like, you know, like you say Leo like Tesla's you you might see a Tesla somewhere in the US in Silicon  Valley every tenth car is a Tesla and  And and they're you know, they're for wealthier people. They're a luxury item  Eventually electric cars that go pretty fast and are pretty great will be pretty commonplace  You know trickle down. I guess is the way to look at it  But this year's the arrow project Larry pages is  Really aggressively driving for an affordable everyday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Family airplane and if you don't have to own it, you know something over six figures isn't necessarily a game  Breaker, although I think the first ones just like the Tesla's will be for for affluent very affluent  People these are by the way vertical takeoff and landing right so you don't have to have a runway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's one of the necessary components it has to be vertical otherwise, you know, who's gonna have their own runway  You know, you're not gonna land in the street. That would be super dangerous  But if you have a you know reasonable space, of course, you know  We're talking about anything anytime you talk about the future five years in the future and more  You're talking about a world in which artificial intelligence is just like electricity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just right in every line and that's another thing Kevin Kelly said we I just did a triangulation with him  That's exactly his point. Yeah, it's gonna be applied to everything and  That changes everything here. These are the by the way the drawings I'm showing are from the zero patent  Which is of course publicly available. They even show it parking in between two cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With its I guess with its wings folded up. Oh man. Now I have to check my roof for dents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine somebody hovering in over you and saying pardon me do you have any gray poop on I  Want I can't believe Stacey. This is just so typical of the Gulf  between boys and girls  You say why would anyone want one and I say why would someone would want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just trying to visualize how we would use it. Oh, I was doesn't look like it's super fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna be faster because you don't have to you don't have to deal with traffic  It's even if it only goes 80 miles an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If everyone has one of these things will there not be traffic eventually because of autonomy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, autonomy is absolutely key and we've even seen this on regular highways autonomous vehicles  Don't have the number of traffic jams. That's true  But I think and I don't think you're gonna see so many of them in the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These easier to visualize the world of these of these flying self-driving airplane things  When you and when you imagine the obvious it's obvious that drones will be everywhere right five years  Everywhere and it's obvious that self-driving cars will be everywhere in five to ten years  And so let's go forward in the future ten years  Drones everywhere big ones carrying cargo and stuff like that safely  Self-driving cars driving everyone safely the idea of a self-driving drone that a person gets in will be just so obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe dark drones pretty noisy now as it stands imagine it. I mean and they're little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again speed and size but  I would totally ride. I mean I have a Tesla I would totally buy one of these. Yeah, see you're the you're the market for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to Stacy's has to go in our for a ride in our zero zero zero  I  Don't think I'm gonna live long enough to see this in widespread use  But I and I have to admit that when when I read about this I thought this is never gonna happen  But that those are the answers to the kind of the critical questions is you know the issues of safety of?  Driving and flying a bunch of people flying yet, you know will in the sky  Autonomy will fix it of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, this is twig so it we'd be remiss if we didn't regale  listeners and viewers with  The details of this secret company that has been kept really secret  so one of the things that was really amazing is initially they bought a two-story building right next door to the Googleplex and  The they only needed the bottom floor  So Larry Page personally took over the top floor and nobody really knew what he was doing there  They were never supposed to mention the words Larry or Paige and so they referred to him as Gus  Gus is an acronym that stands for guy upstairs  So Gus is this Gus is making a lot of noise and they the employees of zero didn't know what was he was doing up there  Until they finally needed the second floor and they moved his stuff out and they're moving out these  massive masters paintings and  exotic exercise equipment and a climbing wall and all this other stuff them and people are watching all this stuff going by and  He's like what is this guy been doing up there?  and  Apparently he used the entire top floor is his own personal playground and playpen and all that even

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine what it would be like to be somebody like Larry Page or circuit grin or Elon Musk or Bill Gates or  mean to have that kind of  Infinite wealth Bill Gates at one point said it effectively. I have an infinite amount of money  I can't yeah, there's no way I could spend it fast enough to run out right and that must be a very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Place to be it's fun to watch all these these these tech billionaires  Like Jeff Bezos and and Elon Musk and so on essentially what they're doing is they're taking the things that they used to play  with when they were  Seven-year-old boys and they're making it real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again that could be good or that could be bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could spend it a little bit more practically but hey, that's just me apparently in my weird feminine viewpoint. Yes, that's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see again mommy doesn't want us to play around  She says be serious get a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know you can't predict the future  It's good that you have all these crazy billionaires wasting their own personal fortunes on what if yes better than the nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course this coming from a guy whose face is painted like the American flag, yeah  Okay, we can now stop using this it's Mike's  Although I have enjoyed it  It looks like basically an absolutely insane person is telling us about flying cars and that's exactly what this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the type of thing the insane person would be talking about so I think it's cool. Yeah. Yeah someday flying cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yet now you've convinced me that this is maybe a little bit more viable than I had  Can they get the question is what can they get the price down?  To low  That's my question  How soon and when can I buy one is actually my my real question?  I  Know wouldn't you I mean see you don't have a commute Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's I do it's like down the hall for my bedroom. Yeah, I don't and nor do I but I live in Austin which has  wretched traffic right it could be in  Again, I see the value actually a guy who's building this crazy house like  Not that far away from me as the crow flies but far in terms of atmosphere  he wanted to put in like a helipad to  Go for you know for his commute, but he decided we all as neighbors like we're against it because it was gonna be crazy loud  Yeah, because apparently we're like hating on the 1%  So yeah, I would love it, but I'm also like god, you know, how fast do they go? How heavy battery technology?  There might be loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, it'll be it'll be like a hundred leaf blowers  And that's a big problem that has yet to be resolved  But you know, the thing is that if anybody's concerned about the traffic in the sky  All you need to do to to resolve that fear is to go on YouTube and look at the the drone swarm  Technology, they you know these these universities and MIT and elsewhere have gotten 20 drones flying in perfect formation in this tight spaces indoors

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sunshine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about going outside it just like enjoying yourself? I mean this thing could have a glass roof. They see that this nature  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I when I picture our dystopian future it does feature flying cars. Yeah, I I picture the fifth element

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, you know the fifth element was a good example, you know  And in the fifth element Bruce Willis is trying to fly that cab in what is clearly insane  Environment but of course if the cab is autonomous  Like that  I don't know why I'm watching this. Oh, this is YouTube drones. Oh, I was like is that a swarm? That's a swarm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are drone swarms. Yeah, it's it'll be a trivial problem to make sure that  self flying  Cars will never crash into each other that they'll all be in these like highways in the sky  you'll sort of like pull in and get in line behind the other ones and  It won't that that won't be the hardest part like you said Stacy it'll be batteries and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all of which are problems. We have to solve for other things as well. So yeah, and of course, you know test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know Elon Musk says that really what Tesla is primarily as a battery company not a car company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're building that gigafactory is gonna be online soon  And dropping the price of batteries considerably by the way, of course  The guy who said there's a the chance that we are not in a game simulation is one in a billion  And I think we've talked about that. He said this at recode a couple of weeks ago  I realize it's easy for him to think that because when you are that rich  You can immediately see oh, I'm bored by life what you know  I need to do something really really something to keep me interested. That's when you start thinking about what we need is a perfect simulation  And have some and I could have a life that has some struggle in it I need to build a simulator  so that bad things can happen to me and  Bingo Bob's your uncle. You're we're all living in a simulation. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wonder whether his belief that it's all a simulation is part of the secret to his success because I mean  What is risk-taking right? You think it's all fake. Anyway, I'm sure it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, we're so meta I don't know I feel like we've got off the rails here. Well, welcome to twig Stacey Higgins

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey we don't need rails where we're  Google by the way  Trolled a bunch of people. I haven't I have to look at I have to get my 6p  There's an Easter egg in the Android and developer preview of version 4  They still haven't named in but they have but when you do the thing that pops up the the version the name of the  Of the Android and it says namey McName face, but I'm thinking that's a joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The I am pushing for a dark horse, which is nerds candy because I figure there's an opportunity for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android fans to name Android after themselves. They said it's gonna be in the next couple of weeks. We'll find out  Yeah, talk about taking something completely inconsequential  And getting some mileage some, you know PR mileage out of it. They've really drawn this thing out ridiculously  Yeah  Yeah, and of course Hiroshi Lockheimer the VP in charge keeps dropping the Nutella hints

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know that whoever it is that makes Nutella is like pulling for it because it's you can't buy that kind of publicity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's a here's a tweet on June 6th from Hiroshi. There's one specific dish on this menu  I'm keenly interested in  I hope it's not Nutella Pizzetta because that sounds terrible  And then his search window where he's testing some stuff out in the search window in the back  You have to really zoom in to see this  says  Nutella Google search for Nutella  He's been tweeting this stuff out like crazy  So maybe it's Nutella I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hope not because the statue that they're gonna put at the Googleplex is just gonna be a jar of Nutella, right?  nerds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we gonna do a pile of nerds? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You gotta have a pile

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. No, I'm like I'll nerds to be it but you gotta get a robot in there  Maybe a robot emerging from a pile of nerds. Yeah stacking the pile of nerds or popping them in their mouth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I yeah, I  Did spend like the last time we talked about it  I spent like two hours trying to think of other in desserts and it was there's not a lot of choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was hungry afterwards. Yeah, but I went with ice cream  Did you go over to Whole Foods and get that hazelnut chocolate chip thing? I talked about I did not  All right, let's take a break more to come Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT mr. Mike Elgin  His triumphant return to the United States all charges have been dropped and he is back baby  He must have just kidding. He's in Los Angeles in most states in most states  I hear Amira cooking something  That's actually my sister. Oh  Yeah, okay, cuz Amira is your wife is an amazing  She truly is she truly you are a lucky man and I don't know how Mike stays so slender  He does not apparently need a Alexa skill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a columnist, I'm always jumping to conclusions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show today brought to you by our ring video doorbell  We love the ring if Mike if you weren't so peripatetic you can have a ring video

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a ring Leo you you're not gonna believe this and people think that I'm completely nuts  but I bring my ring video doorbell with me when I live in other countries because  It's so easy to set up. I when we were in Mexico. I duct taped it to to the front door and  You really want you know when you come back when you're a third world Mexico is in a third world country  But if you're if you are in a third world country where there might be crime and stuff I  Get to know whether for sure whether anybody's in the house when we go in Wow  It's even more useful than I thought or useful and it's really fun to see all the videos it creates when I'm  Packing and repacking you can see all the stuff in my luggage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cool thing about the ring is it you can do it as Mike's doing it  It's designed for a wired doorbell  But and you see that you would pass the take your old doorbell off take the wires connect to the terminals on it  But inside here is a pretty hefty lithium-ion battery  They say it'll last a year  They even include the USB cable that you can charge it with plus a level a screwdriver drill bit all the tools you need  To set this up it replaces your existing doorbell wired or not with an HD camera  Speaker and a microphone and then when you're not home and somebody rings the doorbell you can answer it from anywhere via the internet  They have ring apps for the Android and iOS and so that's really cool. We've put together something really neat the ring of security  Kit so now you get the ring video doorbell for the front door you get the ring stick-up cam  That's a relatively new a product of theirs  It's a wireless weatherproof high-def camera that you can use just like the ring video doorbell  But in other parts maybe get the backyard with the stick-up cam in the in the front with the doorbell  And we're also including a solar panel so you never have to have that power to just takes its power from the Sun  And the chime which I really like even if you've got a bit  You know built-in doorbell with that rings and everything the chime is nice because you could put it anywhere  There's a plug socket, and it will ring as well when the ring video doorbell rings  So it's a great way to increase the reach of your doorbell and all of this  We're gonna give you a special deal on $50 off the ring of security kit  when you go to ring comm slash  twig  Ring RING comm slash twig take a look at the ring the ring Pro now is just out  There's a home burglary every 13 seconds  They really skyrocket in the summer and people are away on vacation now when you're on vacation  You will be able to monitor your front door. It's got motion detection as well as ring detection  So if anybody comes up the the law up the you know path to your front door  You'll know whether they ring the doorbell or not  You'll get alerts on your phone and the fact that you can come on even if you're at work or in Timbuktu and say hey  Yeah, I'm here. What do you want?  That's enough to scare away any burglar and if they don't if it doesn't scare them well  You got a crystal clear video of them which makes it a lot easier to catch them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we have a great new feature Leo  which I absolutely love because I was wishing for this and they implemented it which is that in in addition to  Getting the video and the alert when somebody presses the button or when there's motion now  Assuming you're plugged into the homes electricity you can just say I wonder what's going on in the front yard  Oh, you can just go and look and you don't have to wait for motion or oh, that's nice  You can look any time you want from the app. Oh, they have added that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, oh  Yeah, I didn't even know that I wonder if do I does it just update the firmware do I have to do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No when you updated it should be an option, but you do have to have it wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously cuz you that it would kill the battery pretty quickly if you write that yeah, but but wired it could sit and watch  So, let me see. Here's my front door. I must have to turn that on here. Oh, that is so cool. I'm learning about my ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love that feature and and and but you you know  And I can't use that because I'm using the battery because I'm duck right I can't believe you're doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but you can double-sided tape does dust I've duct tape doorbells to my house and  Double-sided is way better. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can gorilla tape greatest tape ever anyway, so yeah, and so it's it what I'm amazed by is the battery  I've only charged this thing once I've owned it for like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a honey. Are you there? See this is girl out front?  Hey, honey, can you hear me passersby?  You can punk people. Yeah, I see you. I see you. What are you doing?  I want a cracker. I don't want a cracker. I probably should stop doing that right now  That is really this is the live view. I didn't even know they had that I could just turn that on  Ring  Dot-com slash twig get on the ring train right now, baby  right now  rings a thing  Ah  Let's see  Google's springboard a search engine build. I don't care about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to talk about net neutrality or Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh now it's okay  So I have an opinion on the net neutrality and then we'll talk about Apple right because you cover home automation  So the new home kids have also covered net neutrality for years. Okay Aaron to go so the Court of Appeals  Has upheld the FCC's decision to call telecom to call broadband providers telecom providers using title two  Now this was a little controversial when the FCC voted for this because of course title  Classifying something as title two does allow the FCC to do things like set price  But they said no no no we're only gonna do some of the things and the most important one is protect  Net neutrality make sure that there are no deals  for better access  Now of course immediately AT&T and others say no and appeal and sue and whatever  The Court of Appeals has now upheld the FCC and by the way  They've turned down a lot of these things in the past, but the FCC is using a government a power  Given to it by Congress, and that's the key Congress said no no the FCC can classify  Providers as telecommunications providers that's part and it can regulate telecommunications providers  So the court said yep, this is well within your purview now AT&T said immediately well. We're taking this to the Supreme Court  But my I guess my point would be  Even if they lose in the Supreme Court you know right now lobbyists are working really hard on Congress  Because ultimately it's Congress that decides what the FCC can do and  Con what Congress giveth it can take off the way and Congress could easily pass a law that says no no no no these guys  Are not these these broadband providers not telecommunications providers, so I feel like there's no time  It's not a time to ring the bell and celebrate Stacey your opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, I think it is time to celebrate. I mean yes, it could go to the Supreme Court right now  We'll go to the Supreme Court. It will yes, they agree  Yeah, unless yes if they agree to hear it it will it will end up there  And we're kind of in this weird space with the Supreme Court, but aside from all that  Hmm. I'm excited because this gives the FCC not not only does it stop  kind of the net neutrality shenanigans from like  2008 and 2009 which is kind of the way  Rules get written it takes a while right. This is this is the FCC second try actually at net neutrality  But what it also does and this is kind of one of the things that the FCC is allowed to enforce as part of title  Two is some privacy rules so they can start looking at  Like the data that your broadband carrier has what they're doing with it  They can also like rules things like  AT&T's gigabit service when you buy that you have two options you can buy a version that gives  AT&T permission to market to you based on your web history and that's much cheaper than buying the version that doesn't right  So it's kind of like the Kindle with ads or not except. It's your broadband service  So the FCC people in the FCC have told me and this was about a year ago  That they were looking at using some of those rules  To kind of stop some of these practices, which they felt was a little bit shifty making your broadband privacy kind of a luxury  So I'm excited about that  and  I don't see how it can help data caps  necessarily  But I'm sure someone who is way smarter may be looking for that because that's another thing that I think we should be paying  a little bit more attention to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I agree with you, but on the other hand, this is a risky game  I think the FCC if it wants to avoid congressional interference  Would be it would behoove them to be cautious in how they take advantage of these title two powers  I mean if you really care about net neutrality, maybe just start there  Because if they get too overreaching then it's more and more likely that Congress is gonna say no. No, wait a minute  That's not what we intended

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the 1996 Telecommunications Act is 20 years old no 30 years old 20 20 math it's so easy  Long time it's old. It's ancient and there's always talk of revisiting this law like last year the year before  This isn't gonna happen this year. It's not gonna I mean we're about to get an election to worry about so you're so right  next year maybe  Depending on who's elected president the FCC may decide not to enforce some of these things it's all at their discretion  So I look at this and I'm like god. Thank you for like  Giving us some definitive  Language around net neutrality, which we have really been fighting since 2007  the initial idea was in 2005 and  Eleven years later. We finally have some clarity. The other thing we should note is this enforces the same rules for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Net neutrality on wireless networks to which Wow, you're Google didn't think that was a good idea. Yeah, well  hmm  Okay, I'm willing to celebrate I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean I would I'm always willing to celebrate so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is clear that we you know  the this isn't the final say on this and you never get the final say because ultimately all the court ruled on is is  This in your congressional mandate does the Telecom Act say you can do this?  Yes, it does  But it but Congress can always change the rules the FCC only can do what the Congress says it can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the man. I have very little faith in Congress to actually change anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I also have very little faith in Congress not to look at my lobbyist money and say  So I think it could go either way, you know  Look, I'm not a I'm not a political analyst. I don't know what the election does to this  Maybe we'd have to wait till after the election where a member of Congress would have a couple of years to get over any negative  splash back from its  contest constituent  You know what's interesting was a great article in ours technica  About John Bracken. I'm thinking of Nate Anderson's article. Okay, this goes back away to  a  really interesting  Notion something I've been pushing for years, which is that really the whole idea of data caps  The whole idea of ISPs to charge more for more data is actually not economically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Justified right. Oh my gosh. I've been saying this forever. The bits are essentially free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an incremental cost to providing switches and and you know cabling but once you install that  The bits because of peering arrangements don't cost you much if anything at all  And so really this is another case of ISPs broadband providers  gorging at the trough  Without any economic justification, of course, they say oh, no, no, no, you know bandwidth hogs are cost us a lot of money  Well, you know, we can't afford to foot the bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't actually they don't say that as much they're actually pretty subtle about it  They when they make these arguments they argue that you're paying for fairness  So they're fairness. Well, so it's not that it's a cause  I mean the insinuation is that it costs them a lot of money, but you know in engineers from Comcast have said, you know  No, it doesn't and they're to be fair. There are like costs for sending somebody out to like split the node at your cable  Network. I'm not saying right it isn't you're right in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is it doesn't automatically go up when you use more bandwidth right and  Yes, don't get me started Leo. It's it's New York Times actually a year ago  We're in an article saying that the marginal cost of bandwidth is is almost nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The profit margins on bandwidth are 95% Yeah, that's from Craig Moffat  Yeah, who is an analyst who covers this industry and is very yeah, really pro telecom. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I  You know you get all these protests from the ISPs because they're getting a good deal and as a result  We're getting the among about the worst  Internet connection Mike Elkin is testimony. Yes. Yes in the of any developed nation  I mean, it's just it's just terrible looking at the really big picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What frustrates me is the fact that if let's say for example  The US government  Rewrote the entire deal with providing internet connectivity and said, okay, we're gonna invest  Oh just throw out a huge number 50 billion dollars or a hundred billion dollars in  laying fiber everywhere and allowing private companies to offer only service from the government's fiber to the last mile and  if that kind of a scenario resulted in  every single person in the US having  vastly higher bandwidth connectivity  To the internet the economy of the US would probably pay for all this in like two weeks  I kind of agree with you  Yeah  And it's like why are we farting around with all this?  Nickety-diving and all this stuff when this is the old enemy for the US to just be a superpower for another hundred years instead of  declining and becoming a third-rate  2-bit second, you know second to North Korea and  Transylvania and so on in terms of internet connectivity

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so we actually looked at this the US government did some surveys  I think it was in 2009 maybe a national broadband effort and they  To lay fiber everywhere like to almost everyone was like a hundred and eleven billion dollars, which is a crazy  Okay, okay. Hold on. Why?  But we made a decision as a country our politicians made a decision to  Not force not let the government invest in the infrastructure hell we can't even do our roads so  What they did is they set it up you have cable and DSL providers or now the for AT&T and Verizon  so the universe the copper based companies and  Those guys they were like that'll be competitive enough and what happened was it wasn't so none of us are surprised, right?  But what's happening not only is Google laying fiber and pushing them  We're also getting some really interesting innovations with gigabit wireless which  Facebook Google  AT&T Verizon they're even looking at like deploying this which actually takes the cost of deploying broadband down so much  So then it becomes realistic, but we're never gonna go back to like  We don't have the option to make that decision again. It's just it's impossible  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we need to Google balloons to come out here to Southern California because I need a faster connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you made it the way of your flying cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You made such a good point though Mike that the benefit to society to our economy would easily  Cover the costs of anything that could improve this in fact whatever it takes just and why do we lack the political will to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spend money on infrastructure what the hell's wrong with that because the people in control of the bandwidth benefit financially from scarcity or a sense of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scarcity which is why I'm hesitant to celebrate our court victory  Stacey because those guys with black bags filled with money are still prowling the halls of Congress, and I think the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a lost fight they play the long game like you could see them back in like 2011  getting ahead of all this so  I they may attack this and that's fine  But they're already coming up with new ways to  Get revenue and you're looking at things like the zero rating on the wireless side on the wireline side

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is another form by the way of violating that neutrality zero ratings exactly the same problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so in you know the privacy stuff that I was mentioning that AT&T is doing data caps all of those are  Those are basically ways to keep their revenue the same their average revenue per user the same even as the triple play goes  All over the top. I mean that's that's their game and it from a stockholder or shareholder perspective. I totally see why they're doing it I  wish they  wouldn't but you know, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  our our our  Well at least the president now has a galaxy s4  Instead of a blackberry. Thank God for that  He's he's only using a three-year-old phone now apparently of course in order to give the president a phone  You've got to be able to secure it like crazy and that means it takes a few years  President Obama's been using a blackberry  There's a picture of him waving from his limousine with his blackberry. That's in that's six years ago. That's in  2010 he really wanted to do kind of what Hillary Clinton did which has to have a set you have a private phone  But they just they just said no you can't do it, but now he's told Jimmy Fallon. He has a  galaxy s4  It's hardened it's hardened. I kind of feel sorry for the guy. Can we get can we get the president an iPhone just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just once yeah, how about an American phone instead of yeah, maybe enter Korean one  Yeah, yeah, I don't you know the thing that's interesting about the hardening of this of course there are Android based  You know secure phones out there the black phone and so on  But this is hardened in ways that nobody knows exactly what it is  It's an NSA approved  Security system that the details of which are are not available to the public  and I'd be really curious to see how they're enabling the president to communicate and  To move around presumably use  the GPS system  without  You know really any risk of compromising his security you could turn off the radio you could turn off location

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I you know I think there are two there are two goals with any government communications device one of course security  But secondarily you've got to keep track of everything that goes on and there's a transparency rules  all the communications all the texts all the emails all belong to the  People of the United States, so you've got to keep those also, and that's another so there's two issues  It's probably easier for them almost to build their own phone from scratch  And I suspect that it may say galaxy s4 on the on the on the lid, but inside is probably a lot of NSA

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Circuitry it's very very do the president's text do those become part of the absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, one of the reasons the president was reluctant to use texting because he said I don't want  Text to my daughters to become part of the public record  So yeah, it's you don't have a lot of privacy. I'm sure he's looking forward to January a  Little bit right  Apple had a big event this week and that's a lot of interesting things which I think are appropriate for us to talk about  Let's start with the Apple TV. You know when Google came out with its on hub router a lot was a lot of speculation  Oh, this is a stealth  Trojan horse to get into the house so that Google can set up its home automation play and nothing in fact  It's pretty clear now that the on hub isn't going anywhere  Same speculation about the new Apple TV except the difference here is Apple says yes as a matter of fact  This is the hub for home kit so when you're away from home  You'll be connecting to your Apple TV which will open the garage doors change the heat turn on the watering system and all of that  Stacey you must be keeping track of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'm super excited  Well, okay, not super excited. I'm I'm cautiously optimistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what that's kind of this kind of the bottom line for this whole damn show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cautious just just cautious. So Apple's got a new app called home  Apple home kit does have quite a few right there quite a few companies that use home kit, right? There there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there I mean it's not the whole ecosystem obviously  It's a limited number like there's only the August lock. There's a lot of expected devices that haven't gotten out yet  Some of my favorite companies like Lutron. I love those guys. They're home kit certified

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But first alert ecobee connect sense Elgato higher  Honeywell eye  Devices I home and SIPIO and Stian in Stian, of course is a big hub  So if you so if you could connect to the insta on hub, then it connects to other things, right?  Right. So we've seen the Lutron lights you mentioned those and Phillips you  Schlage lock  Yeah, those are  Schlage now works with home kits. So, okay. Hey, oh, yeah  Okay, yeah, and that's one of the big smart smart locks, right? Well, that's that's just a big lock company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's their sense smart deadbolt is now home kit enabled I  Played with the sense that's that's actually an okay lock. It's actually higher quality than my current quick set locks. I thought  okay, so  The thing they did was announce a unifying. Well, one of the things they did in addition to the TV was announce a unifying app for  All of these things to work together because beforehand you  They had third parties do it and it was awkward so  Initially the big problem that home kit solved was around getting your devices online and security, right?  And that was that was why everything had to have the my fight ship. So people who bought the initial ecobee  For example, they didn't actually get a home kit certified one. So right people were upset about that  Same with the Phillips hub, you know, I didn't upgrade the home kit  Upset about that same with the phillips hub, you know, I didn't upgrade to the home kit  Hub, but I will  Um, so I can test it out  anyway, so  the new unified app looks really good and I think it was totally necessary because people were like  Yay, I can turn my lights on with my voice if I have the right phone  but  I can't go in and set up other things to happen  So if I unlock my door, I can't set up for my lights to turn on unless i'm using like a third party app  And so now apple's created that sort of thing that ecosystem on its or that will come out with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's 10 right? Is that what we're on ios 10? The next generation of ios will have the home app  It'll center center all this stuff  So that you can use it  Um, and yeah, you got to think apple's going to do a great job with security  Um the of course the issue is all these competing standards, uh zigbee and z-wave and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In nobody like I live in a mixed use household. So I i've got you know a mixed phone relationship as most people do  Yeah, and I also don't think you want your devices that are going to be stuck like your locks are going to be on your  Door, hopefully for like a decade  And you don't want to be stuck in the apple ecosystem and apple doesn't  It doesn't play well with others people i've talked to who are developing for a home kit  Say they can only use home kit for their device itself. Wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I couldn't make something that worked with both home kit and smart things you can if you use a bridge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's that's what the bridge is about. So like a lutron bridge or some of these other things  Uh, and it's it's different. It's not  Because the eco b3 works with home kit and smart things so it is possible  It is possible. It's um, what's the code? Oh god  I can't remember what it is that they're limiting. I'm sorry. Um, I think it's it's I think it's the device communication protocol

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of would expect apple to say oh and by the way if you want to work with us  You better not work with those other guys. I mean I just that to hear you say that doesn't surprise me and yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, that's not remembering the yeah the details of how they how they kind of enforce that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not going to be a good solution for people if you can't use it because no because well  Is apple big enough? I guess is the question to get everybody to get all the all these guys, uh in in the in the game  maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people refuse to work with home kit because they don't  They don't like how closed off it is now apple's been opening up a little though. I mean  We saw the sdk for siri. We've seen some other kind of indications that maybe it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the chief thing apple brings to the table besides of course market cloud is siri  And the ability to talk to your home  My echo does that but that's the problem is if you have smart things in echo, you already have experienced that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right, do you think that apple will ever come out with a  Dedicated appliance or do you think they'll just use apple tv as their?  amazon echo or some other  I think apple tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes sense. I really do. I mean I thought initially they could do it with the um, what's it called use bonjour and the what?  the  Airport express is that the wi-fi extenders? Yeah airport express  Yeah, I thought you know, you could stick a zigbee or a z-wave radio in there and it'd be like well, bam smart home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the uh, the apple tv's microphone is in the remote. It's the only and it's not always listening  Right, so it wouldn't be as effective  I mean, that's maybe amazon and google if this hello when this hello things come out and maybe they have a  A leg up on apple just because of that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, your iphone's always listening always listening. That's typical of apple, right?  Oh, but if you wanted to use this you have to have an apple watch an iphone and a macintosh and an apple tv  And then it'll all work great  Typical right? They're just selling more product. Go ahead. Go ahead. Uh mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say if even if a future apple tv had the mike built in and you were supposed to just talk  At the tv that wouldn't help you in the bedroom in the bathroom in the kitchen, etc  and so, you know, I think  I'm a little shocked that amazon clobbered everyone in this and get got such a head start  It's comparable to the head start apple got with the ipad, which you know, they just owned it for two years  And and and I think that if apple isn't seriously working on something like the amazon echo and the echo dot and so on  They're they're really in trouble because I think that's going to be a huge  Uh market and a huge way for people to interact with their devices. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always thought like I think apple should buy sonos  Uh, I know sonos has gone astray, but I think it's in it. That's a natural relationship  But we'll see I will say so because someone asked it in the chat. Um  I'm currently using the wink hub as my smart home hub  But I think most normal people are not going to want to hub which is why I like that apple put it in the tv  Because you know most people are not going to really love programming their smart home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I can imagine apple releasing some always listening device  The hub it just means that you have to have one thing that's on your network  That's going to manage all this stuff, but it doesn't have to be the thing that's listening  So I can imagine apple making little listening devices or well, I mean your watch listens and your phone listens  I guess that's the way to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need something  To have the something needs to have radios. So you've got to have whatever radios you're going to want to support, right?  And that's that's an open thing  How you want to do that  And then you need some computing power to remember like to execute commands when you're offline

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if your internet goes down your life still turn on that's actually a good point. We've seen problems with home security systems  That don't work if you're not online  So bad guy just cuts the cord and you're done though  Some of them that use radio don't work when you jam the radio too  So if you're going to rely on these things, they have to be a little more robust

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course apple is the kind of company that would actually  Advertise the fact that they're not uploading any recordings or processing remotely  It's a great opportunity for the chip companies because they're going to need a lot of processing power in order to provide  You know siri and artificial intelligence without offline or without uploading. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple is making a big deal about its differential privacy and this is one where  Um, it sounds good in theory and well the devil is in the details great up post from matthew green  Uh, who is one of our favorite crypto guys? He's at johns hopkins  University his blog is a must read in the crypto community. He talks a little bit about differential privacy explains  What it has been around for a long time. He said i'm gonna have to temper my initial reaction to this  Which is oh, it's so cool that apple's using our latest greatest  Technology, he says on the one hand as a researcher  I understand how exciting it is to see research technology actually deployed in the field and apple has a big field  On the flip side of security professionals. It's our job to be skeptical  To add a minimum demand people release their security critical code  Or at least to be straightforward about what it is  They're deploying if apple is going to collect a significant new amount of data from the devices we depend on so much which  Effectively apple's saying it is we should really make sure they're doing it right rather than cheering them for using such  Cool ideas, but if you want to find out what differential privacy is he's got a really  a good explainer  Here wired kind of borrowed the explainer for their article about this google uses a similar system  to collect usage statistics in the chrome browser  The example a wire gave is if you want to find out information about a group of people  Let's say if they have a criminal record  But you don't want any individual to be associated with that criminal record  What you do is you ask two questions first question is flip a coin  If it's head heads lie on the next question if it's tails  Tell the truth and don't tell us what the coin flip was next question. Do you have a criminal record?  and  Then you can defuzz it because you know how many heads and tails will be and so you can get it  An accurate number about how many people have a criminal record with that  Attaching it to any individual so that's the theory behind differential privacy, which apple announced  But he says it really depends a lot on implementation. There's kind of this  curve where it's more anonymous, but less useful  versus  More useful but really not very anonymous and how you how you twist those dials makes a very big difference in the  Results here. So if you want to know more about this  I encourage you to read matthew greens post. Uh, I think it was today. No yesterday  on his blog, which is a blog.cryptographyengineering.com  And then  Uh, you know apple's been very of course as usual like apple not very forthcoming about what they're doing just saying hey it works  And it's great. So we got to put the screws to apple in a security white paper or something to explain what they're doing  I think so and they're planning to bring it to ios 10 keyboard spotlight searches and notes and probably it's not in apple's interest really  Look if apple's going to compete with google and facebook, they need to mine your data  and  They can make a lot of noise about differential privacy, but it's not very useful in knowing about you  You can't use it to know about you only about a group in aggregate  And so I think apple's going to wave do a lot of hand waving about differential privacy and then meanwhile start mining your data  Just like everybody else does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's possibly a good thing about this is that we now have with such a big company?  That is so friendly to the mainstream consumer admitting that they're going to be  sucking in more data. It's possible that you know people in congress  and normal people start worrying about this a little bit more and we actually get  some sort of conversation about  How our data is being used who's got access to it? What do we know? How long do they keep it? Etc, etc

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think people are much more aware of this. I mean apple doesn't bring this up because nobody cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well that and that's that's good and they're also educating the rest of the people  I don't know. I used to sit in congressional hearings and watch them and sometimes i'm amazed at it  What they don't seem to know the congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're amazed  Well, what you're saying is they don't know stuff that we on the street normal people know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right that we kind of take for granted about how our tech works because they're a bunch of really old  white men for the most part so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that it's it's certainty that our next president won't know anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Much about technology clinton admits she doesn't  Yeah, and and and trump has demonstrated tump doesn't want to know anything about technology, so you're right, uh,  Yeah, it's gonna be interesting  It's the last gasp of a generation that doesn't didn't grow up with technology though. I mean, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but in the meantime, we are really giving lots of people lots of data  That's really useful and we're not 100 sure how it can be used how it can be subpoenaed  How it can be our metadata can be mined to actually deliver?  Personal and identifiable information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's how you know if apple is doing it right or not if apple really starts to become good  As good as for instance google now in knowing stuff about you like here's your airplane ticket  I see you at the airport here's if they really start getting good at that  Then you pretty much know they're doing the same data mining that google's doing and if they remain not so good at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they're not well not necessarily because you the reading your email and knowing your location and all that stuff can all happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Entirely on the phone. That's what they're saying. It's all on device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whereas google just is and and amazon by the way is uploading everything in fact  The the actual recording of your voice is uploaded and stored and they make no bones about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to google.com slash dashboard. You can see all your voice searches listen to all your voice searches. Yeah  Uh, you're right. I think if apple and that was the other side of this equation apple said on device a lot  Uh, yeah, and and if it really is true they can do this stuff effectively on device  then yeah, you're right, maybe this is the right way to do it and uh,  Maybe google will sit up and take notice and maybe follow along because this is clearly the right way to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean one of my concerns with all the privacy, uh  Conversations that people have is that everyone's complaining about the the personal data that's being sent to who knows where?  And and i'm i'm always wondering what what is the benefit exactly is the benefit really that great?  I mean google now is pretty good, but it's not that great. No, I mean, so they're kind of reading you know  Oh, you have a flight. Well, that's cool. You know, but it's like the the amount of  Personal information that companies like facebook or google have harvested about me. I just don't see the payoff  Not with advertising. Okay. I made the mistake of the other day of of look going and looking at a backpack  And now every ad is a backpack and i'm not really sure  That that's the the future of of of personalized advertising. Oh, I agree. Although that harm is trivial. I mean, that's not  The harm is trivial

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the benefit isn't like where's the benefit? I just don't see the benefit. I gave them that information  This is what the best they can do with it  I think you're I think that's why people are kind of aware of it now  Is just merely that the recommendation engine sucks so badly that we're getting look at look at what facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's a list in our there's something in our list about facebook anticipating suicide people who are contemplating suicide  That's actually ai and data in action. It's not defined most of the stuff did like  triggered solely at you is marketing based but  That sort of service is also built on the backs of all the data from the posts they've collected  So are things like, you know, don't but now okay i'm against suicide

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think anybody who's about to commit suicide is great if you can intervene but this is the kind of the ultimate in snooping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it is we talked about it a couple shows ago, I think how facebook was kind of leery about  Doing this but I think they must have made a decision that the good outweighs the harm. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who are they to to make that decision?  This is a this is a for-profit company  Deciding oh, it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're only the most important and powerful organization in the history of mankind. That's who yeah, I mean  I know we've talked about this. We you guys have talked about this a lot about the that  Town hall where somebody said hey should we prevent?  Donald trump from winning we could just throw a switch and he would never do it and have a chance and they thought  Nah  Let's not do we you know, it's like it's almost like they  The power and control that uh, the fact that they can even ask that question  Yeah, yeah, and it's remarkable. We're relying on them not feeling like it  Right. I mean that's not great. Yeah  They they have a larger news audience than any news organization in the history of the world. Yeah  Today let's not be evil today. Maybe tomorrow. They're more powerful than almost every other government on earth  I mean they're that is facebook is just true of google too though or not  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, I I guess so. Yeah  I mean google could could really mess with us if they decided to start monkey monkey and rouse searches

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was that video that said that hillary clinton was getting a free pass  Free pass from google's autocomplete because if you type hillary clinton cri, you're not going to get crimes  Um matt cutts waiting immediately saying absolutely false  We do that for everyone. We try not to in autocomplete  surface  Um offensive stuff offensive stuff. So if you type hillary clinton cri you get crime reform  crisis and crime bill 1994  Uh, I have to point out if you type, uh  First of all, nobody relies on that and if you type hillary cri  You get hillary criticism hillary cries hillary criminal email  So it's clearly a filter and it would work the same way with everybody that they don't want to surface crimes in the autocomplete

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interestingly though matt cutts pointed out that you know people who are  Very anti a given candidate tend to use their on a first name basis with their nemesis  and so that's why because because people who are  Who are who have a bias against hillary clinton don't say hillary clinton. They say hillary  Interesting even even trump, you know says crooked hillary. He doesn't say crooked hillary clinton  He I don't think he ever says that but you know, the big story here is the is the and and jeff jeff jarvis isn't here  so i'll be the the the inappropriately anti trump person but  Donald trump is is demonstrated contempt for silken valley and technology. That's this pretty scary  for example doesn't like his coverage in the washington post and starts talking about who's gonna go after jeff bezos and amazon for  Anti-trust issues and this is another one where he's essentially pandering to the ignorance of the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did that video come from him or no, it just came from a youtuber

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But didn't he didn't he uh, i'm sure he was thrilled to see it. We're talking about it. He might have tweeted it  Yeah, right  And so that that's a that's a real source of concern to just be completely  You know matt cutts is trying to use logic reason and facts to counter what is just a political  Opportunism yeah, and so that's a that's a little that's a little scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an interesting now in more cheerful news. Here's an  Artificial intelligence produces realistic sounds that could fool humans. This is just wild example of machine  Learning what they did  Is they taught essentially machine learning to understand?  What kind of sounds physical?  things in the world made  By just feeding it a lot of information sounds can tell us and just to be clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not generating the sounds they're recorded sounds  It's matching sounds with what it should sound like based on what it knows about the materials and the surfaces that are being  Are supposedly producing noises

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's fooled real people they so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To produce a plausible soundtrack to go along with it to perform this task  Well, the algorithm has to recognize the materials that are being hit and the actions that are being performed  But we don't explicitly tell it about these things  Instead it has to learn about them by recognizing patterns in the raw audiovisual signal. This is the true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know video sequence artificial intelligence and it predicts a corresponding sequence of sound features

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  After a network predicts sound this is a neural network synthesize a waveform by matching these features to a database of impact sounds  And transferring the best matches here are some soundtracks that our algorithm produced. This is listen leaves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good  And then it's a stick  This is computer generate sound  Oh, the sound is real, but it's matching the sounds to help understand what our model's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can look at the video clips in our database that it's transferring audio from  These are the audio clips whose sound features are most similar to those predicted by our model

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know suddenly hollywood sound engineers are realizing that they're automated foley, right? This is from mit.edu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's uh, it's it's actually doing a pretty good job fooled me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what it's I mean, it's actually from a computer perspective  if you think about  matching  an image to  A name of what that image is. It's kind of doing the same thing. It's matching. So I mean it is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just the beginning. I mean, this is exactly the point is that we think of computer image image recognition  But there's also but but but we've got to get all the whole sensorium. I mean, i'm sure there's smell recognition coming any day now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the big picture is that slowly but surely we're creating human cognition. You're essentially saying okay  We're teaching this particular  Uh machine learning ai that you know, okay, so you identify the object. That's a stick. That's a bush  What do sticks sound like what a big stick sound like what a little stick sound like what do plastic stick, you know  And we're teaching them all these properties  Not only recognizing what's there but then having we're actually not teaching them using a neural network. The computer teaches itself itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just feeding it data  Yeah  You know, we've been through several ai winters, but I think we're in an ai spring  Yeah. Yeah, very interesting  Uh us air force little plug for carbonite. You might want to think about it apparently  actually, you can't blame the air force because  uh, the automated case tracking system or acts is run for the air force  by a commercial entity and  apparently  The database crashed  And they've done everything they can to recover it and they have lost records  Of 100 000 investigations and everything from workplace disputes  to  fraud  Lockheed martin, of course the defense uh company that that manages this database for the air force apparently there's no backup  And so these invents unbelievable  That would be insecure. We've kind of exhausted. This is uh, this is air force spokesperson  We've kind of exhausted everything we can to recover within the air force now  We're going to outside experts to see if they can help

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now the chinese government has a copy of all that stuff. Yeah, maybe ask them

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might ask well  Was this just accidental or there's some investigations ongoing investigations in there that somebody didn't want you  Uh, that was my first thought to know about the database goes back to 2004. But yes, there are current investigations in there  so  Wow  Talk about an apt  I mean you had one job  That's just bizarre. We don't win  Uh, all right. Let's uh, let's wrap this up with some final thoughts. Maybe  Stacey said the most stressful part about doing this is the pick of the week  But i've told you stacy you may do anything you want. It does not have to be anything having to do with technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think she's like like nine out of ten times or maybe eight out of ten. It should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, i've got mine is completely weird so okay i'm just telling you  But first let me tell you about this. This is my pick for never losing your keys  Again, it's the tracker  I love this idea. This was a kickstarter and then it's gotten better and better  This is the latest anodized aluminum aluminum very lightweight. It attaches to remotes keys even animals  In fact, they've got a waterproof case if you want to put it on your pet's collar and because it's so lightweight  It's really really  Unobtrusive now you see I have it attached to my keys  Well, the key is you you pair this to the app in your phone via bluetooth and the separation alerts go both ways  So if you lose your phone, you could press the button on the tracker  And the phone rings even if it's on silent  And of course if you lose your keys the tracker has a map on your phone that says here's where they are even inside your house  They've got a really a cool way of kind of  Finding stuff even inside the house like narrowing it down. Oh, yeah, it's under that seat cushion  Now the other thing that's cool is because there are so many tracker devices out there one and a half million devices in the wild  They have the largest crowd gps network in the world  So that means if I lose my keys on the beach, I leave the beach  If somebody walks by with the tracker app running  Their app will see my keys and notify me through the tracker network where my keys are so you can see  The last time your keys were seen  Even if it's not through your own phone, they've also partnered with companies like hp  Allowing companies to build trackable products and utilize utilize the scale of this tracker gps network in your your next hp  Device this bluetooth le so the battery lasts over a year. It is replaceable  So you just pop it out. It's one of those, you know dime like lithium batteries  You can also purchase the water resistant case, which makes it great for pet collars or you know in  Challenging environments. You'll never lose a thing again with tracker, but you got to get a tracker for everything that you lose  So here's the deal go to the tracker t h e t r a c k r  Dot com they say the hardest the hardest thing will be finding the website  T h e t r a c k r dot com. There's no e  And just for our audience day gift it is father's day. They have if you I think it might be too late. I mean father's day  Sunday  Yeah, but kevin yeah kevin are you listening buy two get two free for father's day  But if it's but if you miss that deal we have a special offer for you for our audience  Use the promo code twig for 30 off your entire order  So t h e t r a c k r dot com promo code twig  So use the if the father's day deal is still good as you hear this  That'd be the best deal because that's half off  But you have to buy four of them  If it's not good anymore use our promo code twig and 30 off no matter how big or small your order is the tracker  Dot com promo code twig you lose your keys a lot  You will never lose them again, yeah  Uh, let us do our pick of the week thing and i'm gonna i stacy  I so feel so bad about you being nervous about this  I want to start with you. So just get this off your plate off my plate this week. I actually have something really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  okay  This this requires a setup. All right. Here's what i'm showing you guys. This is the  Illumi  outdoor led floodlight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i-l-u-m-i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the reason this is cool is because it's the only color changing outdoor rated light bulb. Oh  I have i have found it's a br  uh, whatever  30 br 30  Um, it is i'm looking ip 64 rated in uv coated  So i've had this outside in the rain for like two weeks now two and a half weeks  And it's rained a lot here in austin. It's on my roof  so it's super hot super  intense and  That is that  So here's here's what it does. Oh, that's blue. Ooh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's like a hue but it's the one that you can put outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and  So it's also hue doesn't have a good, um  kind of  Green color but this one does not that I really recommend that but you know  That's okay. So here's the other cool thing that it does you guys you don't need a hub for this either, which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the hue requires a hub. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, okay, I will tell you these are on my roof. Well right now it's on my desk next to me  But if it were on my roof  Because my office is out of range. I couldn't actually control it. You'd have to go upstairs to do your lights  Yes. Okay. So here's the party  fun thing  Let's see if it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna oh  It's a disco  in stacy's  House so the lights if you're not watching are going in different colors to the music

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and there's there's actually different themes you can that's actually really fun  Isn't that fun? And so the downside is it's through spotify. Okay, so on an android it's through spotify and google play  Okay, um, which means I can't run it over my sonos  But if you turn the volume down on this and then you play the same thing over like your exterior just as you still get  That kind of fun flashiness, right?  Oh, this is $70

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now here's a question because I see it has power on default  One of the things and I got somebody calling the radio show this weekend about it and I had to agree with him  The default on the hue lights is if the power goes out they come on fully bright  And which means I don't want this in my bedroom because it happened to me about three in the morning all my lights come on  All the way up and i'm going what the what the what and i'm scrambling around fortunately  Lisa had the presence of mind to go flip the switch. I'm trying to find my phone to turn off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't tell your echo to turn them off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't have this is before I had an echo and it's actually one of the reasons I haven't since reinstalled the hues  Can you say to the power on default is off? It looks like you can on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. This has never happened to me. It says power on defaults. That's implies that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That does it also says it can detect your presence

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think through bluetooth so it knows when my smartphone's there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like the stack like no, but I like that idea if you walk in the room  It can see that your uh home and it will turn on the lights. I like that  That clap on you don't even have to clap anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No clapping. Yep  Music sync rise and that's that's my thing because you know, it's all right. You'll do me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I l umi  And there's more though  But wait, she's not done  Oh, do you want to do your austin dive? I'm fine with it. It's a super it's a super

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh well known dive bar in austin, so it's not like this is going to be secret for anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I already have one bar. I love in austin. That's the alamo, uh draft house because it's a movie theater bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have free movies during the summertime for kids. They're all kids movies, but like i've actually considered moving to austin just because of alamo  It's a good place. Um, so they asked me for a dive bar  So I I did provide them with a little longhorn saloon because at 4 pm on sundays you can play a game called chicken  Poop bingo, they don't let that because we're in texas  Um, so what the game basically is they feed this chicken they let it run around on a bingo  But you put bets on where it's gonna poop and it poops  And there's video  Of course, there's video  I mean, this is basically an excuse to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ginny's little longhorn saloon good music, I bet right austinites and a tourist magnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  South by southwest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's tiny  Yes, yes, it's out in bernet. Do you go if I lived in austin? I would go out for music every night  Do you go out at least once a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, i've got a kid so i'm waiting for her to grow up  But I do go out like at least probably two times a month such great music in austin it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  And I have a feeling, you know, my only experience is during south by I have a feeling I really  I should go there when the tourists are not in town normally. Yeah, you should come like in the october

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  November, it's beautiful weather. Okay, people will play outside deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I can go play a chicken poop bingo at ginny's little longhorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you're there, you'll be near my neck of the woods so you can stop on by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? That's your neighborhood bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not my neighborhood

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay. There's no shame in that mary joe foley our host on windows weekly has a neighborhood bar rattling home  Of course, she lives in nanatown

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But uh, my my neighborhood bar would be the dry creek saloon, which is up on 222. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you lived in petaluma, what was your neighborhood bar mike elgin?  Uh, it was my kitchen actually you had some good stuff there. I remember that yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's actually a new place. Um, uh after petaluma. I moved to cotati, which is  An even smaller town north of petaluma and I used to go there's a burger place there. I don't recall  Uh recall what it was. Oh, I know where you're talking about. Yeah  Yeah, they have outdoor like fire and you sit around the fire one of those kind of places that was a great place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To hang out and drink good beer. Come back. We've always got a spot for you  Just come back any old time you want. I will do you're on the road. Are you gonna stay in la for a while?  What's your what are your plans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, i'm gonna be back and forth between la and the bay area over the next couple of weeks and then we're going to new york  And then we are going to france. We're gonna live in the south of france. Oh god. I hate you. I just hate you. Wow  Yeah, it's worth all the contempt that people feel for me god. That's my dream right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa and I talk about that all the time  Yeah, it's it's really awesome tuscany or the south of france either one or both

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We we lived there last we lived in tuscany before as well. That's a must do  Hey, so if you don't mind leo, i've got a couple of things i've got a i've got a tool and also a tip in the tool  I don't know how much you've talked about motion stills  uh  No, go ahead  Okay  So one of my favorite things to do is to is to explore the ultimate mobile computing experience by combining google stuff and apple stuff  And I really think that oftentimes you get the best of both worlds with these and this is a perfect example  Motion stills is a is an app created by google  that uses  The iphone's live photos feature so live photos, of course  If you leave the default on and have live photos go you just take a picture  But it actually takes a little video which you can you know very short that you can see and hear by pressing and holding or  In certain circumstances where you can actually use this live, but even use it for the wallpaper and stuff  so motion stills actually adds googley goodness to the  the live  Photos it will stabilize them so that if they're you know, tend to be very unstable  It'll stabilize them and also allow you to very instantly  Create a gif and use that as a gif anywhere else. It's so weird that apple didn't do this. It's their own format  Exactly. I'm sure they'll come out later with these features  But what's great about it what I love so first of all if you're using this you do have an iphone and you do use live  live photos  Make sure you go in and the default is medium quality, which I never get  Throw it on high quality and give it and there's also an option to get rid of the watermark  It'll put its own motion stills logo logo is weird. I want to get rid of that. Yeah. Yeah, it's ugly  uh, and so make sure you do those two things and then and then what you do is um, you know just go what what I  Love about it is the fact that it creates these  These videos or gifs by default  So you just take pictures and forget all about motion stills and then you're like, oh yeah motion stills and you go into the app  And they're all there already  And you and they're created instantly on the fly so you can just go through and say I don't that didn't work  Oh, look at that one. That was really cool. That really worked and then you can just post it and share it on facebook or wherever  Uh really highly recommended for anybody who uses an iphone  Okay, so that's my pick of the week now. I also like to  to  Do a kind of a thing that we need to be reminded of once in a while, which is that  There are fantastic full-length movies available for free easily accessible on in various places  Especially youtube so  For for people who are younger and hear cultural references that refer to movies  And you may not have ever seen the movie and where do you see the movie?  You know the video places don't really have it because it's too old or whatever  So you might have heard people refer to roshamon. It's his Japanese. Oh amazing movie  Yeah, or night of the living dead the original zombie movie or sex lies in videotape or any of these the man with the movie camera  fantastic  Very old russian movie for anybody who's into cameras and movies and cinematography. You got to see the man with a movie camera  Okay, these are all  All these that I just told you are available full length in good definition on youtube and we'll put the links in the show page  on twitter tv slash twig  And you can see you can just click over and watch these full-length movies fantastic idea  But it's more the the whole idea you can also subscribe to channels on youtube like timeless classic movie and there are  Bunch of others that just have full-length movies and you can always go and see what people are talking about when they make these cultural references  Related to that  We've probably all heard about a documentary very long documentary multiple hours long called oj made in america about oj simpson  And this is critics are just loving this documentary. So about oj simpson's childhood in san francisco and going to usc and all that stuff  And a lot of interest has been regenerated by the the oj simpson trial  Series that came out recently. Yeah, but but espn is the is the filmmaker behind it's one of the 30 on 30s, right?  Yeah, yeah, so you can watch the whole thing  All seven nine hours, whatever it is on the espn site as of today  And simply go to espn.go.com  And then watch it watch espn and then that's it and that and on that on the right  You'll see all of the episodes of this oj made in america series  And again, I haven't seen it yet personally. I'm gonna go see it over the next few days, but critics say this is the most  amazing documentary in a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well good. You gave me something to watch tonight. Yeah. Thank you all night all night a seven-hour documentary  I didn't realize it was that long. Yeah, I thought it might be 30 minutes given the name  Oh  Oh, well  Thank you. Mike elgin. It's really great to have you at some point. I would love to talk. We didn't even really talk about it  About apple's catch-up attempts with the photos apple photos to catch up with google photos  Yeah, if they can do it on a device and without  Revealing stuff that might be an interesting alternative to google photos. Seems like they're doing a lot of the same things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be but you know, I gotta say regardless of what personal information is collected or whatever google photos is the most  Under-appreciated fantastic site and service out there. It's I I get so much out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what if you have an iphone you can use both that's the beauty part. Yep  a couple of tips for me one, uh, you can now use your facebook messenger as your sms program on android facebook has  Restored that feature and you know, it makes a pretty good text messaging  Service. So one of the nice things about android  Uh is that you can choose what uh, you know  Launcher you want to use you could choose what your default email program is and you could choose your default text message program  You can of course use google hangouts or the messages program that came with your android phone  But you might want to think about using facebook messages all of those rich messages features that apple showed and they still work with sms  and you can send messages to  Phone numbers as well as to other facebook users and internet users. So  I've replaced my little hangouts icon in the in the bottom of the screen with the facebook messenger icon  It works quite well. And then finally for you, uh,  This is an interesting intersection of sets if you are in the set of harry potter fans and the set of  command line bash shell users  That's probably a pretty narrow slice. You will be interested in these harry potter aliases from now on  Instead of typing wget you can use axio if you'd like to remove all file files ava cadavera  Imperio is pseudo prior incantato will give you the history stupefy will sleep your machine  When guardian leviosa will move files around turn the sound off with sonorous turn it back on with quietus  Yes, many of the best harry potter spells  Now usable on the bash command line whether you're using windows 10  macintosh or a linux box

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I want that as an echo sdk  So you can actually control your blinds  Oh  See like this is when I got back from harry potter world  I wanted to use my wine my wand to like control parts of my house  You could do that with the echo you totally could get there and be like i'll work on that just for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been wanting an echo skill would want an excuse to write an echo skill. That would be a good one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the best of all the the neighbor's kids can uh can shout commands at your echo from outside and open and close the blind

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Expecto patronum and you hear cow sounds or you know  It'll be awesome. I will work on that just I don't have that automation. I gotta say what is your what is your spirit animal?  You'll have some questions for you so that we can customize it just for stacey higgibotham find more of stacey at stacey on iot  Dot com she's gigastacey on the twitter and don't forget her great podcast with kevin tofel all about the internet of things  You can find that at stacey on iot as well  Thank you stacey great to have you

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice nice to see you here. And of course mike elgin the peripatetic mike elgin on the road again  But you know, we've survived the skype issues and it was great to have you and your insights as always  Uh elgin.com you could follow him on google plus and don't forget becoming nomad.com the blog of his travels around the world  Thank you mike. Thanks for having me always a pleasure and please give kevin and nadia my congratulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I certainly will they're having they're reproducing and I couldn't be more happy  This will be your your first grandson. That's right. That's right. I'm a little look i'm too young to be a grandparent  Let's just face it, but i've already been grandfathered by at&t. So this is nothing new grandfathered in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congratulations to you and amira then I guess as well. Thank you so much. That's great. Thank you  Uh, we uh, we'll be back here next week. And so will jeff jarvis. He's traveling a lot. He tweeted his  Regrets at not being here. He said stacy. Sorry, he's gonna miss you and uh, he wishes he could do twig  But he has once again hit the road for uh travels  He says as soon as classes end he's got to go out and start giving lectures  But I it's my understanding he will be back for uh the show next week. We miss you jeff  Also a side note kind of a little bit of a sad note. Uh, of course, uh this show a longtime host, uh, jeena trepani  Had left to pursue  Think up.com her startup with anil dash  Sad to say anil announced today that they are shutting down  Think up on july 18th  If you want to find out about refunds if you paid for the service, I loved the service  It was a great service for getting insights into your social accounts including facebook instagram and twitter  But unfortunately according to anil changes to the api and requirements on fence's facebook instagram and twitter  Made it just impossible for them to stay in business and to continue so they're  Shutting, uh think up down and we really uh will miss it because it was a very useful tool  Gina is gainfully employed fear not as is anil  But think up as a service it will go down on july 18th. Thanks everybody for being here  We do twig every wednesday 1 30 pacific 4 30 eastern time 20 30 utc  I hope you'll tune in live at live.twit.tv or twit.tv slash live your choice  If you can't make it live, of course, you can always get it on demand twit.tv slash twig or wherever you get your podcasts  Thanks for joining us. I'll see you next time on this weekend. Bye. Bye
