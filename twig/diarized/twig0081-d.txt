Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Good to be here.  Missing Leo, but great to be with you, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Leo is going to be gone for a couple more Twigs.  Also with us, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  Good to see you again, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello there.  You're in sunny Amsterdam.  I have lamps upside down in a hotel room outside Amsterdam trying to get enough light to make  this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that kind of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Committed to the art, you are.  Yes.  I brought some Chipotle chips so that I could try to fit in in Leo's place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.  Now you have to crunch them into the mic really, really closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then sing a song about them.  That was like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys watch Glee?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two new Glee episodes this week, two.  And that's all I'll say about it.  It was a good week for Gleeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo is steaming his way towards Antarctica.  Last we knew on Twitter, he was in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins.  So there is your Leo Laporte update.  He called it a Gentoo penguin.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The live Gentoo penguin.  Not the live CD.  The live penguin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's start off talking a little bit about the webOS announcement that came this morning.  HP announced three new devices for webOS.  The HP Touchpad, it's a 10 inch device, 9.7 inches particularly, 1024 by 768 display.  The HP Veer is kind of a tiny phone.  I guess it would be similar to the Pixie.  Maybe it's a replacement for that.  It's 2.6 inch touch display, 5 megapixel camera, 8 gigabytes of storage.  The HP Pre 3, which is a portrait slider phone, the successor to the Palm Pre 2, 3.6 inch  screen, HD video, 8 gig or 16 gig.  So we're going to see the Pre 3 in summer, the Veer in early spring, and the tablet not  until summer.  And that's only for the Wi-Fi version.  3G version comes later.  Gina, I know you were saying you didn't really pay that much attention to this announcement,  but are you sad to see that they've gotten rid of the name Palm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does feel like an end of an era, doesn't it?  Like Palm, this was kind of like the, it was the dawn of the PDA, which I guess we don't  say that anymore, right?  I am a little sad.  I think they could have probably stuck with, so it's now just the HP Veer.  It's not the Palm Veer or the Palm Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's the, yeah, it's the HP Veer, the HP Pre 3 and the HP Touchpad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Touchpad is a great brand.  I mean, HP is a great brand.  Manufactured, built, invented a lot of really important things.  But I did like the Palm brand.  It does feel kind of like the end of an era.  Like they're retiring, I think, a brand that was pretty good and like that you associated  with handheld devices.  But you know, it hasn't been in the game for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somewhere up in gadget heaven, Palm and Newton are talking to each other.  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There they are.  Look at them.  They're right next to DEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The HP Touchpad, dual core, 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon processor, 1.3 megapixel camera.  It looks like a sufficiently nice tablet, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't.  You know, WebOS is a nice operating system.  There's one in my household.  It's not mine. It's my other half's.  And I guess this kind of represents a commitment to WebOS, right?  I'm excited about good looking mobile operating systems, kind of more competition.  What is the usage rate of WebOS compared to iPhone, BlackBit, RIM, Android at this point?  I'm not sure, but I imagine HP included this in their presentation today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Market share is very small.  So I haven't looked through the entire presentation myself.  I've only looked at the vital stats.  My guess is they didn't talk about the usage rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you want to show the really small sliver of the pie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're talking, you know, 25% for Android, 25% for BlackBerry.  We're talking 2% for WebOS right now, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's smaller than Symbian, which is about to die.  Did we all catch the memo that the new Nokia CEO wrote this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Burning Platform memo, which is my favorite nickname for a memo since the peanut butter memo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  It was awe inspiring.  And you wonder, A, how Nokia could have gone so far so fast and how even a new company,  even though it's not new, but a new business can go down so fast.  But then the second question is they're supposedly debating now between Android and Windows OS.  I can't see how it makes any sense to pick Windows.  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's more worry that they're going to pick Android.  In fact, let's bring in Kevin Purdy.  We finally got on the line.  He's joining us today as well.  He's contributing editor at Lifehacker.com and the author of an Android book.  What's the name of your book again?  The Complete Android Guide.  Complete Android Guide, which you can find at CompleteAndroidGuide.com.  What do you think about the odds of Nokia going with Android, which, like Jeff says,  in absentia seems to make some logical sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does.  They were so vehement, though, in denying an earlier rumor that they were going to use  Windows Phone 7.  They were so kind of prideful in saying, oh, no, we would never use Windows Phone 7 for  our main OS.  It makes me a little skeptical, but I think it would be a great move whether or not they  do it or not.  I mean, different patterns.  Which would be going to Windows?  No, no, going to Android would be a really good idea because then they could, you know,  Some of my friends have always said that Android would become like Nokia, like the OS you don't  even know you're using.  You know, you could totally brand Android in a way such that it wasn't so apparent that  you were using a Google operating system.  Nokia could totally brand and kind of image Android in its own image, but whether or not  they do so is another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is HP better off owning Palm or could HP have gone to Android as well?  That's what I'm trying to get my head, or for that matter, Windows.  They're a Windows vendor.  I'm trying to get my head around where this landscape goes past iOS and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, Jeff.  I think that they must feel that they must have some confidence in the talent and the  staff at Palm that they feel like they can come up with something new on their own.  You know, everybody liked WebOS when it came out, you know, and thought that was a pretty  good competitor to the iPhone.  It never really managed to gain leverage.  I think that they must feel like they can go it alone or, you know, come up with their  own ecosystem.  But it feels like a pretty crowded market right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in addition to the two phones and the tablet they announced, according to an All  Things D report, Group Executive VP Todd Bradley, a personal systems group executive,  said that introducing WebOS to our PC customers later this year will drastically expand the  platform.  They're sort of moving into the Chrome OS space as well.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was kind of the bomb they dropped at the end, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was almost missable.  It just kind of sneaked it in.  At the end of two hours.  Yeah.  The two hour death march of an announcement.  Nobody could notice.  Yeah.  Do you, I mean, do we suspect a CR 48 like offering from HP that runs WebOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brave move.  I mean, if they could do it, because even Google hasn't really kind of released CR 48  beyond, you know, the test group that they have.  Which I am not a part of.  Yes.  Well, I haven't seen an update.  I have one and I haven't seen an update at all for one.  I mean, they've done a few bug fixes, but there hasn't been like a huge jump forward,  you know, unless they're just holding it all back or something.  I'd love to see a, you know, a vibrant ecosystem of web only Netflix, but it just doesn't seem  to be happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll play with that for a second.  So if HP, who obviously puts out tons of Windows products, uses its own OS, and if Nokia goes  to something and doesn't go to Microsoft, is this bad news for Microsoft and Windows  of various flavors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's bad news for the carriers.  The carriers are the most worried that Nokia would switch to Android, which I really don't  think is going to happen.  I mean, Steven Elop is an old Microsoft guy and you could overinterpret those sorts of  things, but if they, it's going to be a big deal if they drop Symbian or go de-emphasize  MeeGo, their other operating system.  I can't see them doing that to go to Android because that turns them into just another  manufacturer and they built themselves on branding themselves as a unified experience  that's the Nokia experience.  But the carriers are worried if they go to Android that that will eliminate all the competition  and all phones will be either Android or iOS and predominantly Android.  And we get, you know, they have no more leverage anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why would you buy a HP, NaPOM device?  What's the main selling point to go with the mini OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really couldn't tell you.  I mean, they're even dropping POM legacy support with WebOS 2.0, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They made a big deal about how multitasking was really important for them.  They're playing on the whole slides metaphor even more.  It seems like their selling position in my early read is that this is a higher performance  product than iOS or Android.  Does anybody buy that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Higher performance.  Those are my words, not HP's.  Until you put it on actual hardware and give it to actual people and they use it in their  actual day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to see this thing in action where I can pick it up and play with it, because  that I was actually very skeptical of the BlackBerry Playbook until I got my hands on  it at CES and it worked great.  And it has true multitasking and the ability to have a couple of things running at the  same time and switch back and forth really fast.  That has impressed me.  I don't think that's going to save BlackBerry on the tablet, but I think it will at least  prevent them from getting entirely left behind.  I want to see WebOS in person before I make any judgments there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I don't want to jump ahead here, but I'm dying to ask Gina, now that you're  getting some details about the Zoom, the first Android tablet, are you going to fork out  800 bucks plus a contract?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what are we looking at?  February 24th is the release date for the Zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the leaked Best Buy page date.  OK.  Motorola still hasn't given us an official date, as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I might be in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina for those who don't know, has been hoping out saying she's only going to get the  pure, blessed Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have been saying that.  And I'm pretty...  I'm jonesing for a tablet, I have to say.  And so to me, it was like iPhone, iPad 2 or the kind of the first...  Oh, iPad 2 is in the running.  Yeah, I'd be interested in checking out iPad 2.  So yeah, the Zoom is tempting.  I might do it. I might do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. You're going to jailbreak iPad 2 and try to run Android on it or you're  just going to buy an iPad 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want a tablet. I want a good tablet, right?  So an iPad 2 might be it, right?  But yeah, no, the Zoom, I also want an Android tablet.  So...  Eight hundred dollars?  That's a lot. It's a lot.  I don't know. I haven't decided yet, but very, very possible.  I registered for Google I.O. in the hopes that like there would be a tablet giveaway.  I don't know. Maybe that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  I was hoping for that in Davos this year.  Nothing. No, you know, I wondered Murdoch when they did the announcement of the  daily, they said at the end, there are tablets outside preloaded with the daily.  And I asked on Twitter whether they were giving away.  I've never heard an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  I, you know, there's a note here that says Google saying no free loaners.  No.  I'm down. I'm not a good guy in the free business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked for a loaner from Google for the complete Android guide and I got a no dice.  You'd have to ask Motorola for that.  So I'm interested because that breaks from what I've previously experienced with  asking Google for loaners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't think the Zoom's coming out.  I'm sticking to that.  Like the fact...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $800. You have to decide whether you're paying a $300 I love Android tax.  I mean, that's pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  It's a good point. And everyone knows that I am cheap.  So I don't know. I don't know.  It's very, very tempting, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They never let anyone actually use it at CES.  They only let that video play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, they let someone use it at the Honeycomb announcement.  When I asked for a loaner, they said, well, you could have come out and played with it  at the Android 3.0 event.  All right.  Even at that Android 3.0 event, even on the stage demonstration, the video call with  CeeLo was really rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they still haven't confirmed if it was going to launch February 24th.  I feel like we'd know by now because they ran a freaking Super Bowl ad for it.  Right. And this leaked ad from Best Boy.  Best Buy.  I'm just, you know, I'm trying to hide their identity.  We don't know.  We don't we don't know what company it could be.  Somebody like Best Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agreeable Purchase has announced that they're going to have a Motorola Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Radio Shark.  No, this ad also says that Wi-Fi will not work until you activate a data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really sleazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, really?  iPad 2.  Yeah. Apple even managed to make AT&T go month to month with the iPad.  And, you know, we couldn't make Motorola agree to not even make you activate a data  plan. Eesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Activate for at least one month.  But which makes you assume you can do one month and then cancel it.  But that's then throw in the month with the deal when you're charging that much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, you should never just disable Wi-Fi because somebody didn't pay.  That's the whole point of Wi-Fi.  That's that's evil.  It actually it actually takes that.  Well, I guess I was going to say it takes the burden off your network to encourage  people to use Wi-Fi. But if you haven't activated a plan, that doesn't take any  burden off your network.  So I guess they don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the evilometer is definitely up in the 10 and 11 area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vapor hardware.  Telling you there's going to be a big announcement.  Motorola say, you know, we've run into production problems.  It's delayed. Are you serious?  I made this prediction after CES and now I have to stick with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give the odds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Odds of seeing the Motorola zoom by the end of this month, I will say there is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  twenty seven percent chance that we'll see it, that we'll see it.  Mr. Pessimist.  It is a short month, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  I'll go I'll go all the way to the end of March and only raise it to like 36 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geez.  Are there any others at the CES that are working behind Android,  appropriate Android tablets that might leapfrog zoom here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we got the LG tablet.  I haven't heard much more about that one either, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dell was rumored to be working on a Android 3.0 tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did say that.  They all supposedly says that as soon as the OS is ready, they're going to be  shipping stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they showed off their Windows tablet yesterday and they said they will  have an Android version as well later this year.  But that's also still later this year.  Galaxy Tab 2.  Haven't heard anything detailed on that.  There really aren't any Android tablets besides the Galaxy Tab that is already on  sale that have solid info behind them, are there?  Hmm.  I think they're all a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't really think that.  It's all just computers.  Do you know what you consider the  thing that they tabbed formerly known as Palm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The WebOS tablet, the VIR?  Yeah.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  That was quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not at all.  Just not enough usage and not enough interest for me.  And also, I'm developing for Android now, so I'm kind of going to buy the platform  that I want to develop on, which is part of the reason why I want to get the iPad,  is that I'm working on an iOS app right now and I don't even have an iOS device.  So it makes sense to add one to the arsenal.  But now, WebOS isn't that interesting to me.  Although, like I said, there's one in my household.  It was a company issue deal and it's really pretty and it's nice and it feels good.  But it wasn't a consumer choice.  It was like, this is what my IT department supports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you love that phrase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to hate that phrase.  That's why I like working here.  IT doesn't support anything.  I just do it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  You have everything.  You do it all yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  You mentioned Google I.O., Gina, and tickets sold out in less than an hour.  Kind of.  Sort of.  Kind of.  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't really.  Well, Genix can explain a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, so I got an email from Google last week that said, hey, you've been to Google  I.O. before, so we're going to give you a chance to pre-register for the event, which  I did.  So they basically gave everyone the opportunity who went to the 2010 event to pre-register  for 2011.  So then they opened it up to the public on Monday morning and then the rest of the tickets  sold out in under an hour.  So I mean, my read on this is like the 2010 event, not only was it a great event, but  you got two phones.  You got a Droid and the Evo before the Evo had even been released.  I mean, I was talking to a student who went who got the student discount.  So his ticket was a couple hundred bucks.  He was basically like, my ticket is more than, you know, costs less than the cost of both  of these phones, basically.  So the giveaways are great.  The event was great.  And so I think that a lot of people from the 2010, you know, 2010 Google, I re-registered  for 2011.  So I imagine that they filled a lot of seats, you know, in that pre-registration period.  So I think it's great that they sold out in under an hour and it's a lot sooner than  the earlier, the 2010 and 2009.  But it wasn't really quite just an hour, you know, that they filled up every seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May 10th and 11th in Moscone Center.  If you're wondering when it's going to be, Gina, you're going to be there.  Jeff, you're going to be there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to be in the East Coast teaching.  Okay.  We will miss you.  I know.  There's going to be much fun going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you can talk Gina into giving you some of her stuff.  I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I'll turn my question to the thing is, if I came out, I'd stand there, like I'm speaking  tomorrow at a conference in Amsterdam, a media conference, and I'm the only guy speaking  English.  That's the way I'd feel at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those speaking situations are always bad.  I spoke in Amsterdam once and I was the only person speaking English.  It made me really nervous during the introduction in Dutch that I couldn't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd be grabbing on to Gina and saying, what are they saying now?  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Translate that for me.  And then they'll all turn against you and notice that you are not one of them.  They drive you from their midst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo and I are going to do some live coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Kevin, you mentioned you're going to be there as well.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, do you think that most independent developers sign up for this thinking like, yay, free  phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I didn't last year.  But I'll be honest, after last year, this year, I did.  I was like, oh, there's probably going to be a pretty good giveaway.  I think developers sign up for it and they get it.  They expense it as part of their kind of company development efforts.  I think there are a lot of development efforts that's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you had to justify it to, say, your boss, like Nick Denton, how would you do so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd say, hey, you know how we keep getting complaints about how stuff doesn't work on  Android because we don't have any Android devices around the office?  Like, send me to this thing and I will come home with Android devices that we can test  the website on.  Snap.  That works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can record it and say, I'm going to catch Google executives in affairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the way you get this.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could say the founder of Lifehacker even agrees with me and play that bit.  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  New numbers out for search engines.  These come out rather regularly.  And usually I'm not very excited about them because it's usually Google either goes up  or down 1%, Bing goes up 1%, Yahoo goes down 1%, but they're a little more dramatic this  time.  Google only dropped 2%, but they did drop between December and January.  They're now breaking it out as Bing powered search and Bing.com to include Yahoo as part  of the entire Bing ecosystem, I guess.  So Bing powered search went up 6%.  Bing.com itself actually went up 21% from 10.6% of the market to 12.81%.  And Yahoo search went down 4%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an alarm.  What's the anomaly there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be a typo.  They went from a 10.6% share in December 2010 to a 12.81% share in January 2011.  That's not 21%, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah, 10% when you start small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a percentage change like the 2.8.  Yeah, okay.  But still, usually Bing only goes up less than 1%.  They went up just around 2%, just a little over.  2% points, I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And give them the whole skillet.  It's all that Google results feeling they're doing.  It's all the copying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stealing results, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really don't think that...  I think that thing was so overblown.  And I definitely don't think...  I don't know if you guys know this, but I am in week three of a month of using Bing as  an alternative to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us about that.  It is now my default search on all my browsers.  I still allow myself to use Google if I need to, but when I go to my default search, it  uses Bing.  I would say 90% of the time, I don't even notice the difference.  I'm looking for something that comes up, I'm able to find it.  Where I do notice the difference in a big way are in video and news searches.  In video, it's a positive for Bing.  So when I'm looking for a particular video, I actually find it in Bing.  Almost never find videos in Google.  I have to trick it into giving me the page that I want, trying to find the actual page,  or I just go straight to a source like YouTube, which is Google.  In Bing, I'm able to find videos really easily.  On the other side of it, news is horrible in Bing.  If I know I read a news story and I actually have the headline and can paste the headline  in, I still can't find it on Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  News is hard.  That's why we should all use day life, for this is where I'm a part of.  To get the right sources and the right kind of it, it's a whole different kind of categorization.  I have a really stupid chart that I show at media conferences like the one tomorrow.  I say that discovery of media was based on brands.  We went to the brands, we had to buy the publication, we had to go to the show.  Then search came along and changed that around, obviously, where we have to ask first.  But then to the side of that, I put a nodule, which is algorithmic, in that Google wasn't  good at live.  Only Google News made them be good at live.  Algorithms are crappy at live and current.  Algorithms need content to ferment, like wine, before they know anything about it.  And then the next circle up, by the way, obviously, is human links, which is Twitter and Facebook  and such.  But the algorithmic piece, the ability to understand the language and understand the  currency and the sources and cluster it together is, as they say, not trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You degraded IO, Jeff.  Not trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can just say that again.  That's not trivial.  That's not trivial.  I need the IO glossary for how to fake your way through.  That'd be a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe you could use Google Translate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to come up with common developer phrases.  I think that's not trivial is a very common...  That's my coded way of being like, yeah, that's not going to happen for a while when I'm talking  about my own apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have the link right now, but somebody wrote a great post that I tweeted yesterday  for how to write a polemic book.  And the funny thing is, my two books follow the rules.  You put one word, and then at the end of every paragraph, you use that word and say it all  comes back to this.  And then after the book's out, you come back and reinterpret any event in the world the  same way.  Of course, it's part of the same trend.  So last time it was Google understanding the world, but for me this time it's publicness.  So yeah, I think we could do a whole language sort for Google I.O.  I'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should do that.  I'm going to start writing down developer phrases as I use them and hear them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to see a phrase cloud generated out of these talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In that phrase cloud Chipotle is up high too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, burritos, crush, glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think glee will be there though, right Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing.  I don't think too many developers are talking about glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can predict the next Malcolm Gladwell book by just looking at that cloud.  That's right.  There you go.  You can have it auto written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see the Malcolm Gladwell book generator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed.  It's great.  There's a website.  I wish we had the link for it, but it generates a Malcolm Gladwell book automatically.  Just hit refresh and there's another Malcolm Gladwell book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, getting back to these Google numbers really quick.  I mean these search numbers from Experian.  Are they significant, Jeff?  I mean, is it finally worth looking at them?  Because usually I just want to ignore them every month because it doesn't seem like anything  really to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I don't think necessarily.  I think it can blip up.  I think what you have to do is look at a longer term trend.  And Google last, I don't know what the current market share is, but they've been running  around, what, 67%?  The US market share.  And here in Europe, in Germany, where the Germans complain about Google constantly,  that was a bad accent, it runs about 98%, 97, 98%, showing that media and government  are quite out of sync.  So Google already is not in a search and has not been in a search monopoly position in  the US for quite some time.  What's the next break point where it matters to Google?  Well, you could say 50%.  Yeah, sure.  It's going to take a long time to get to there.  Second, it's not really a search industry.  It's an ad industry.  Google's way ahead there and does have much higher market penetration there, way more  than the Microsoft has.  So from a business perspective, there's a lot of ego invested in those numbers.  But I don't think there's a lot of business reality yet.  Check me in the year.  I can be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yet Google acts like they're under severe attack with this whole gotcha, you know, we  caught Bing with seven to nine results out of a hundred being copied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, part of that, I think, is that Google, you listen to Google, you listen to Eric Schmidt  talking not about Facebook as a competitor, but Microsoft as a competitor.  You now see this Bing stuff.  It is in Google's interests to seem as if they have hearty competitors, aplenty.  Apple's a big competitor.  Facebook is competitor.  Microsoft competitor.  Monopoly, Schminopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, we have people trying to copy our results.  We must have competitors.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also extra sensitive about spam results.  People have made a big deal about that for a couple of months now.  We talked about it on Twig.  You guys have talked about it on Twig quite a bit.  Matt Cutts has a blog post up today comparing Google in 2000 to Google in 2011, really trying  to show you that the results have improved.  They're still fighting this FUD that Google's results are getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Matt isn't a PR person though.  Matt is, you know, the lead engineer in the spam team.  You know what I mean?  So he, I mean, I think that Matt's a good guy and I think that he takes a lot of pride  in the general perception about Google search results, especially spam results.  So it makes a lot of sense.  I think this is great that he did this post.  I think people tend to, when things are good, you know, when they initially launch, I think  later people tend to say, well, that kind of sucks now.  Let's jump the shark.  When in reality things have gotten better.  I think that was Matt's point here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan in the very first comment on Matt's post says, last year you effectively  dropped host crowding by putting up more results from a website for some searches rather than  fewer.  You know, this is an issue that drives me insane.  One result per site subdomain, you name it.  That's all I need, especially with the use of site links.  I simply don't understand why Google can't give me more variety in my results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kudos to Danny for having this conversation.  First post too.  First post, he's a good journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he resisted the urge to just write first.  All right, let's take a quick break and thank Squarespace, the fast and easy way to publish  a high quality or website or blog.  I use Squarespace for a couple of different podcasts that I do.  Forecast right here on Twitter.  I use a Squarespace blog for that to keep track of everything, let people know when  we have new episodes up, give people a chance to comment.  It's really easy to use.  You can make a good looking site.  I have no design sense whatsoever.  And Squarespace is a savior in that respect.  You can pick from hundreds of templates.  They have, I think they have thousands, almost hundreds of design templates to choose from.  You can customize any design to fit your needs.  It's easy to customize things like colors and move blocks around.  But if you do know CSS or even want to learn a little bit about it, you can get underneath  and customize it even more.  The service includes modules to build your website, widgets like Flickr photo display.  You can add Google Maps.  You can have multiple people working on the site.  Doesn't cost anything extra.  They also adapt the bandwidth to your popularity.  You're just paying your one fee and they make sure that there was enough bandwidth there  for your blog to be visited.  So why don't you go check them out?  You can actually import your old site.  If you want to see how your site looks in Squarespace, take the site you've got now.  Doesn't matter what it is, type pad, movable type, blogger, WordPress, import it into Squarespace  and try it out for free.  We're giving away a 14 day free trial to sign up for a free account.  No credit card needed.  Just try it out to build out your website.  Go to squarespace.com slash twig at squarespace.com slash T W I G.  Why don't give it a shot?  Either import your site and see what it looks like or just create something from scratch.  Play around with it.  You got 14 days and see what you can come up with.  I think you're going to like it.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  So on a rather serious note, I'm not sure exactly how to pronounce his name.  Is it whale gonim?  Does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're saying the video gonim.  It's a whale gonim.  Whale gonim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is a marketing director for Google in the Middle East.  He disappeared during the protests last week and earlier this week was released from prison.  He made a remark about how he had fooled his employer in order to go to the protest.  I found this very interesting that a marketing director at a big firm like Google would also be a leader of the protest movement.  He was one of the administrators for the Facebook pages that were used to organize people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is also kind of neat too that the tool he used was Facebook.  But that's OK.  That's only a smart online person recognizes the appropriate tools to use.  He wasn't using social tools and that's OK.  I think incredibly courageous man.  I don't know if he knew what he was getting himself into when he did it, but the fact that he did.  And also the story that I'm dying to hear is what did happen to get him out?  How the protesters made him kind of their unofficial, though silent spokesperson to keep the spotlight on him?  Was Google bringing anything to bear?  These are things we don't know yet, but thank God he's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, thank goodness he is out.  I mean, what a leader.  And from a purely kind of from a company perspective, I think that he's an incredible.  I think he was representing Google really well.  This was kind of like the Internet.  He's calling it the Internet Revolution.  This revolution happened because of activity on the Internet.  That that word was spread through social media.  He used Facebook, he used Twitter.  But, you know, Google's been known to use Twitter, maybe not Facebook, but at least Twitter to organize actions.  So I think I think it's incredible.  I think he's been really articulate.  And, you know, when he first went missing, Christa Bona had tweeted that that he was missing.  And I just been thinking about him, worried about him for so long.  I'm so glad that he's freed and OK.  And what an incredible leader.  I would love to know what his conversations with his managers are like at Google.  You know, what Google had to do with this, if anything.  I don't know if we'll ever know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was in prison for 12 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They like blindfolded in solitary, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The journalists who've been in prison have talked about hearing horrendous torture in prison and other things.  It's wildly unpleasant and difficult to imagine.  And when journalists are also kidnapped or taken prisoner, oftentimes, new journalistic organizations manage to keep that quiet.  I suspect in this case, the publicness of it, you know, was part of what helped to get him safely out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're just really glad that he is out.  He says, quote, I'm not a hero, but those who are martyred are the heroes.  He's broken to a chant of Mubarak, leave, leave.  So he's not done as are most of the protesters in Egypt, not done with this yet.  Move on to some Android news.  We talked a little bit about the Zoom earlier.  Gartner had some more numbers out.  Good news for Android OS sales grew 888 percent in 2010.  That's almost a useless number, isn't it?  Yeah.  880 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's happy about that number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, with the Verizon iPhone coming out, a lot of people have been kind of, you know, friends and relatives have been kind of like, oh, what do you think about Android now?  And, you know, it's funny to think that, like, you know, that it's still growing pretty big.  And it would take a large number of manufacturers, you know, turning their back and walking away to make Android just instantly disappear overnight.  But 888 percent is nothing to sneeze at, even if it is a kind of fake number almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gartner and CommScore both put out numbers this week.  And iOS, depends on who you're reading, seems to be doing great.  Not losing that much market share or gaining a little versus Android is obviously the big winner.  And there's no doubt that they're taking it from RIM.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the use case for having a BlackBerry now?  Seriously, guys, like what is it just hardware keyboard or is it your company?  Canadian Pride, is that what you're saying, Jeff?  Yeah.  Or your company just forces it on you?  What does BlackBerry have to really recommend itself these days?  Nobody.  I'll take a stab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The BlackBerry enterprise server is loved by many who want to manage permissions on IT network or have good security and not worry that somebody is going to, you know, break into the phone system.  So I think that's legit.  I've also heard a lot.  I've heard some developers say that they prefer BlackBerry's because they prefer the keyboards on the BlackBerry devices and they've got to do some terminal coding or whatever on their phones sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Encryption and that kind of thing, too.  And generally, you know, if your corporate overlords have a BlackBerry server set up, they're going to want to stick with that.  But every time these results come out, it's always Windows Media and BlackBerry that lose out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But go back to earlier in the show.  It makes you wonder whether the investment is at all worth it.  If they have a shot in hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And certainly speaks to, you know, that's the great thing about the Nokia story.  Nokia owned the world.  And on the burning platform, you know, he yelled, the new CEO yelled at him and said, you know, how long has the iOS been out?  How long has Android been out?  Where are we?  And he was lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nokia's share of the smartphone market dropped 6.7 percent from 2009 to 2010.  To what?  They went end users, phone sales to end users reached 461.3 million units.  A 7.5 percent drop.  That's for their entire phone sales.  And then smartphones dropped 6.7 percent.  I don't have the total number there, though.  And smartphone is always, of course, a kind of fluid definition of a phone that runs apps or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still.  But the super smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that we know what it is.  Right.  Super phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's easy to pick on WebOS because they're the underdog.  They're very small numbers.  How could they possibly make an inroad?  But a lot of people made those arguments about Apple when they first came into the phone market.  Not everyone, but a lot of people.  Well, what is Apple?  Now, how are they going to break in against the dominance of Symbian and Blackberry and Windows Mobile?  And that market has turned on its head.  So I guess what it's what you're saying, Jeff, to me, it sounds like it's hard to identify what that advantage is.  WebOS is a fine operating system.  Conceivably, it works great.  But what makes you choose it over?  Yeah, no, that's a really good point.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But nobody used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So I mean, to go back to that discussion, but that's what this is fascinating to me is that is that the momentum seems so strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cost of entry or reentry into this is now so spectacularly high.  How do you compete with free?  You know, how do you compete with free?  How do you compete with free?  How do you compete with free?  How do you compete with free?  You know, how do you compete with a network of manufacturers?  It just seems like if you're rim and Nokia and HP.  I think it depends on deep pockets and being able to get developers involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Apple has managed to be able to get developers involved because the demographics of the iPhone are such that people like to buy apps on it.  They're trying to, you know, they already had iTunes set up and people own iPhone.  Really, you know, don't mind paying $1.99 for an app.  Android is backed by a company with huge pockets, huge, huge, huge pockets that could, you know, whether or not they make money on the system itself is almost like a secondary mission to getting people on the web and searching through Google.  If Rimmer HP had, you know, had a long enough game plan, long term enough game plan, I think that they could, you know, somehow entice developers.  But it's the third party developers in a large way that you have to get excited.  Really critical point is that the I the OS in mobile is not the end game whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's obviously just a tool on the way for the case of Apple.  It's to sell hardware for the case of Google.  It's more signals to enable more relevance in search content and advertising.  And it's a it's a fight that Google needs to fight to fight Facebook, which is a better signal generator.  I like that phrase for our laws.  And so you're right.  It's not about the OS at all.  It's about the how it feeds the the Uber business strategy.  And neither rim nor certainly HP really necessarily has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although to say that Apple does make money on iPhones, much if you look at the graph, Apple makes tons of money on iPhones as opposed to most other manufacturers.  We agree there.  I was saying is hardware is the real business model for for Apple and sales of other products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that works.  Right.  They have enough just to make money.  Right.  They have enough justification that they will invest in that OS because it pays off in other ways.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, consumers, I mean, people bought the iPhone because they didn't want to carry on a phone in their iPod anymore.  Right. I mean, Apple had millions of iPods out in the market to begin with.  So it made sense for people.  And then with Google, it was like, I want a phone that's going to give me the web without a gatekeeper, you know, full web access, being able to search easily.  What is what is the what is the compelling from a consumer perspective?  What's the compelling reason to buy another phone at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really would have to be like cheap or amazing battery life or they'd have to instantly come up with great apps that everybody wanted.  You know, the success, the better than Angry Birds, Angry Birds, which would be pretty hard at this point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What could possibly be better than Angry Birds, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I don't know.  Happy birds, agitated moles.  Did you guys see the guy that dressed up as kids is the Angry Birds and then took a photograph?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's on Laughing Squid.  It's very, very cute.  No, but I saw a funnier die did a real life Angry Birds where they built a catapult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  And actually and it had like, you know, big red rubber balls with the bird faces painted on them and then set up the stuff.  Right. You know, the wood pieces and everything and put little pigs in there.  Sweet.  The thing is, they actually were able to knock it entirely down every time.  Those structures are way less stable in real life than they are in the game.  I think that debating the physics of Angry Birds definitely goes into the coders like, you know, phrase phrase book for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  Windows Phone 7, which is a really good phone if you just if you lived in a soundproof bubble and had never read any news in the last five years,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows Phone 7 is a really easy phone to use.  My you know, my wife has one and it's it's pretty nice.  It's really big buttons and really big widgets.  Live updates.  Very nice.  But even Microsoft with all the cache that they have was not able to get everyone they wanted as a launch partner.  They weren't able to get I believe I'm sorry.  They were not able to get Pandora on board right away, which is kind of a big deal.  These days.  I mean, that's almost like a gold standard for smartphones.  And there are all these new gold standards that exist every every time a new phone or a new mobile device comes along.  You have to have Netflix.  You have to have Pandora.  You have to have, you know, really good Twitter and Facebook apps.  And it's a pretty big, you know, fence to get over if you're going to come out with a brand new thing.  HP and POM and RIM would have to have really good apps in all those categories just to even like, you know, guard the edge of the screen.  That's where something like Alien Dalvik by Myriad becomes really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure how well this is going to work, but apparently a mobile world Congress in Barcelona, they're going to announce Alien Dalvik as a piece of software that will allow Android applications to run on non Android phones.  Is this is this as wonderful as it sounds?  I read a little bit about today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounded pretty interesting, but it seems more like an unofficial hack really than something that, you know, that, you know, mass market merchants would want to have Android running on their devices unofficially or, you know, essentially like virtualization.  So the same way you'd run, say, you know, Internet Explorer on a Mac by virtualizing your phone.  And Myriad is a virtualization company would run say on MeeGo and be able to run all Android apps on MeeGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends entirely on how well this works.  And my initial reaction is like, I wouldn't want to do this because it would probably be a waste of time.  But I think it's a really good idea to have an Android app on a Mac.  And I think that's a really good idea.  But that's just sort of my experience with virtualization in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think, you know, Android likes its memory processor.  And I just think putting that the Dalvik is the Java runtime that that Android runs its Android Android operating system and apps are all Java Dalvik is the runtime.  So this this Alien Dalvik is the Java runtime.  And I think that's a really good idea.  Yeah, I don't know.  This seems this seems like kind of a niche side project for like super nerds.  I don't know that this is going to be a consumer thing, but I could be wrong.  Would you want it to work as a developer?  Would you want your Android apps to be on every single device?  I mean, I think that's a really good idea.  I think that's a really good idea.  I think that's a really good idea.  Would you want it to work as a developer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you want your Android apps to be on every operating system and conceivably run everywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In theory, but in practice as a developer, I want the app to work quickly and smoothly without any sort of hiccups or memory problems or forced forced closed dialogues.  And I don't know.  It depends on how well this works.  It's hard for me to believe that this this virtualization software that will work fast enough and well enough on, you know, non Android phones to work well.  But but I shouldn't I shouldn't say that until I try it.  But sure, I mean, as a developer, I want my app to be everywhere that it can be.  I hope that my app is good enough that someone would want to install virtualization software to run my app.  That would be nice.  I just don't know how realistic that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got some app news.  Google Translate was updated.  Now, this was updated not just for Android, but also hits the app store as well.  For the iPhone, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I said app store, that was very vague.  I mean, it hits the iTunes app store.  It was previously available as a website.  It would just go as it and get the HTML5 version.  Does Google, are they able to gain an advantage by doing this where they have something available on Android for a while and then roll it out to iOS?  So they're like, hey, we're platform agnostic.  But you give a little edge to Android every time.  Does that build up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I really don't know anybody of my casual Android using friends who were, you know, when I asked them why they got a droid, they're like, oh, Google goggles, because that's why.  Because that was an amazing, you know, I mean, a lot of Google's first run apps for Android are kind of.  Nifty apps, and they're not necessarily, you know, must have, except for Google navigation, which I must say is, you know, continues to be kind of a huge selling point for Android.  But I really most of the apps that go Android exclusive at first are are just kind of neat things.  I don't really see them doing the kind of power play like they did with the original droid and driving navigation.  So I can't imagine, but I would love to see the numbers, you know, if they did polling on why people got their phone.  I love the idea of Google Translate, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you, Gina?  Yeah, Google Translate is an awesome app.  I think it's great.  It's on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think it's interesting and I don't have numbers to back this up.  But my impression is that most third party first run mobile apps show up on the iPhone first.  So iPhone users generally get third party apps first.  I think that Google releasing internal Google apps on on Android first.  I mean, certainly they want to attract attention to their own platform first.  There's also that pesky approval process that they have to wait for for Apple, you know, if they submit their app to Apple.  But I think there's also just this like, hey, look, you can get cool Google technology on your on your Android phone.  And like, this is one of the things that you get when you get Android.  Here's my brain fart of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was gone because Swisscom in the hotel room charges me a friggin fortune and eight hours in advance.  They cut me off anyway.  But you digress.  You know, you almost I started fantasizing about a single use product just for translate for travelers.  Right. It's the it's the Star Trek device that as the flip camera proved the viability of light video.  And now we don't need it because we got our phones and so on and so forth.  But I almost wonder whether Android could power a very simple single use device like others to say Google.  The problem is you can kind of get a lot of people to use it.  But if you did a deal, the connectivity was only going to do occasional translations.  It was really minor usage.  You almost wonder whether you could build a device like that.  I know it's kind of silly because how often you really use it, how often you really travel.  If you need to talk to your your servants and you and you don't speak their language, maybe use it more often.  But just in terms of thinking about how these OS could be used in different ways to power different things.  It's a it's a wider question, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of in this world where we're getting multi-use devices in multiple form factors, which I remember reading about in Scientific American in the 90s in the MIT folks at the time.  We're saying this is the way it's going to be.  You're just going to have a big device at home that sits on a cabinet.  Then you're going to have a smaller one at your desktop.  And then you're going to have a little little or one for for moving around like a tablet.  And then you're going to have a block and they're all going to do everything.  That's pretty much what we've got.  That's what's happening.  But the question is, is there still room for single purpose devices when so when what was the name of the the Twitter peak came out?  Like everyone just mocked it because all it did was show Twitter and it didn't even show all 140 characters in a line until you clicked through.  That's obviously the worst example of that.  But you bring up a really interesting example, Jeff, which is that's something practical.  If I'm sitting in Sky Mall on my plane and Hammacher Schlemmer sells a universal translator for $400 that I can buy and carry with me on my business trips and will translate everything everyone says and vice versa, that would sound attractive.  Yeah, that's probably probably is not big enough a device, but it's just I think we're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too narrowly about the use of these OS and the only thing I've seen that breaks out at all was that was the I've mentioned three times now the Android ski goggles.  You know, see the map in your in your in your line of sight.  OK, cool.  But I think that when you're connected, there are devices that are going to work on a very simple level.  And the problem right now is the is the phone models don't support this.  But certainly the hardware could and the OS could.  But Android is the one to do it.  I guess it would would I choose a single purpose device like that, whether it's the translator or not, if I could also get that app and just have it on my phone and carry one less thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will you still buy cameras?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, lots of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've given up the idea that I'm going to carry a separate camera.  It's my camera phone, but I'm not a photographer.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's it.  I'm with you.  No camera.  Sorry.  Nexus one works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this I guess you could call this the Scoble problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which Scobel are you referring to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scobel was the one that I was referring to.  Scobel will always carry lots of cameras, but that's Scobel.  Right.  Well, and maybe that's it.  Right.  Which is we'll want these separate devices when we're really enthusiastic about whatever it is they do and want the extra performance that can be squeezed out of the device being specialized and optimized for it like a DSLR camera.  I don't think you'll ever see a phone that will also will work as a DSLR camera.  The form factors alone just don't compare.  So yeah, I mean, I think that's where something like Android does have a huge possibility to become an embedded operating.  What are the operating systems in DSLRs?  I know a lot of the point and shoots work on embedded Linux of various flavors.  Really?  Which you can hack.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe that's a business model for somebody coming up with a really awesome third party firmware for cameras that lets you do crazy things like automatic tagging and geo tagging and stuff like that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trademark this group.  Indeed.  All right.  AT&T is trying to really say they believe in Android.  They have lagged behind of the major four carriers in the United States.  Chief marketing officer David Christopher says of Android, they create highly functional, highly capable smartphones that run really well with our network.  And they're they're rededicating themselves, starting with the Atrix.  Atrix is their their big example.  They say we got involved very early in the development of that product with Motorola and Google.  And they they say they they don't want to do a lot of work to customize Android anymore.  So are we finally going to see decent?  Is the Atrix the change for AT&T, the C change, do you think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was the Verizon iPhone that was the C change for AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the that's the C going the other way, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  Yeah, the Atrix was cool.  You guys I wasn't at CES, but you guys all sort of was one of most of your top picks, right, for one of the some of the coolest gadget that you saw at CES.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I mean, I think this is, you know, this only makes sense for AT&T and it's long overdue.  And I don't think that it's a coincidence that it has to.  It's this sort of story is running around the time that the Verizon iPhone got released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't think we have to control every element of the smartphone at all.  Finally, because that was that was the that was the biggest problem, wasn't it, Kevin?  They kept customizing Android in a way that made it awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I'm not mistaken, AT&T has the worst track record when it comes to upgrading their Android phones, too.  I think literally at some point it was zero percent like every every phone and every device that had been delivered on AT&T network had never been upgraded.  My my boss and life hacker, Adam Pash, he has nothing but quietly couched hatred for his Galaxy S on AT&T.  I mean, for a long time, iPhone was all that really it seemed like AT&T necessarily really wanted to support an upgrade.  And they have a long ways to go.  But, you know, kudos to them for rededicating themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Oh, Kevin, you watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, really?  I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Peripherally, I was getting ready for the glee party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not even for the commercials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of ran in the living room to watch the commercials.  The Darth Vader commercial.  Very cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you know they're all going to be on YouTube the next day, who really needs to watch the Super Bowl for the commercials?  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that was the thing, right?  I missed the first half almost.  I sadly caught the halftime show.  But I missed a lot of the commercials.  But it wasn't a big deal because I could go and watch them afterwards.  Although apparently this is the highest rated television show of all time.  It beat last year's Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm kind of a dad in reverse.  I've only ever watched Super Bowl for ads.  And then to have something to talk about with my son, Jake, who ended up learning football around me.  So he's teaching me football now.  I actually kind of enjoyed it.  Yeah? Nice.  Yeah, I did.  I decided to become a Jets fan and root for them and got into watching the games to my surprise.  I'm discovering my hormones late in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did that affect your desire to see Super Bowl ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't have to wake up to watch the ads.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't have to rouse yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The big one was the Zoom.  Well, the big one in the tech sphere was the Zoom ad, which was a kind of almost tired at this point.  You know, kind of 1984 Apple-ish ad.  Don't be like the others. Get the Zoom tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking about this on Tech News Today.  It was sort of tired and old for us that are enthusiasts of technology.  But it was incomprehensible for anyone who didn't know what it was about.  If you didn't get the reference, it was just kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weren't there white earbuds involved?  Yes. That was the only funny thing was the white earbuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sitting there.  I actually heard stories of other people who were in big groups watching the Super Bowl and were then explaining,  well, you see it's a metaphor for Apple had a Super Bowl ad in 1984 and now Apple's kind of become the...  Never mind.  $3 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a great amount of stuff.  It's a huge amount of subtext to throw out for people who are watching this in a loud living room or a crowded bar.  You know, like, oh, look, I catch a cultural reference on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I still don't get it. But when can I buy the product? We don't know.  How much is going to be? We don't know.  But I'm ching.  There was also the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play ad with the freaky thumbs being sewn on to the Android doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like nightmares.  Yeah.  Did you see that, guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have not seen this one.  Is it yet another scary Android ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thumbs are being implanted onto the little Android green man.  And it's really nightmare stuff.  It's freaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, yes. I'm watching it now. Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's, you know, it's all back alley dark, scary. Exactly what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the Android ads are like this.  What is up with that? The raining robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness. It's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because putting thumbs on an Android doll is illegal in most countries.  So you have to go to a back alley to do it.  Wow.  It's just too.  I have no idea. Like, why?  Why are they in? Why is it dark and dirty? Why are they in a back alley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it makes me wonder, too.  There's got to be some control over the Android brand.  Who's in charge of the brand at Google that allows that to happen?  It's also awesome for Asian culture to apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you have to send an Android to a, you know, you know, Vietnam or Thailand to get thumbs onto it,  because they only do black market thumb appendectomy.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really what is hitting me the most is like, why couldn't he just go to a nice, clean hospital?  I know. It's awesome.  The walls are white and the nurses are pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wait, wait. That means Apple. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Android is the dirty underground.  And the question is, is, you know, Sony Ericsson Play is the PlayStation phone, but they're not branding it that way.  They're branding it as Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Which, you know, Android does have a good amount of games now that are pretty cool.  But whether people like Jeff was just saying, you know, do people need a dedicated Android game device if they have a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know either.  I think some.  It's weird to me.  The people who really would want that are probably people would rather have the next generation PlayStation play a portable PSP and then carry a separate phone.  But I guess there could be a cross section in there like we were talking about earlier, who who just don't want to carry more than one device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. The casual casual gamers, right.  Aren't going to get aren't going to get the dedicated device.  And if they do, it's going to be the next.  We all just said we gave up cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I yeah, that's no, that's a really good point, Jeff.  And what did you I have to ask, what did you think of the group on ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gave me another reason not to like them.  And I've already got some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, if you haven't seen the group on ads, they would start as if they were some kind of public service announcement or an awareness raising charity type thing.  There was one about the oppression of the people in Tibet, one about destruction of the rainforest.  But then they would change halfway through and be about getting a discount.  So the one about the oppression of the Tibetan people turned into a discount on Tibetan food at your local Tibetan restaurant.  Tibetan curry noodles, Tibetan curry noodles.  That's right.  And then the one about the rainforest turned into like getting a Brazilian wax or something, because not all forests are bad.  Yeah.  Or not all forests are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know those were Christopher Guest either.  So now his track record has diminished slightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now with the way Groupon, let me see if this washes with any of you.  The way Groupon tried to defend this was we actually didn't say anything bad about these causes.  Saying go get Tibetan noodles does not in any way diminish, you know, trying to work for the plight of Tibetans.  It doesn't make fun of them.  And saying, you know, getting a bikini wax doesn't have any effect on the Amazonian rainforest.  And in fact, we raised awareness about issues that wouldn't have been talked about in a Super Bowl where it is apparently OK to advocate, you know, violence and sexism in all of your ads.  We're getting in trouble for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they were making fun of their customers, really.  They're making fun of what you guys talk about on Twitter all the time, which is that, you know, Groupon has a lot of salons and spas and, you know, niche restaurants.  And they're saying, you know, haha, you're more likely to get a Brazilian wax than to care about the rainforest in Brazil.  But then on the website, they actually exploits the cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  On the website, they actually had fundraising links for those causes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But whatever, when you're watching the Super Bowl and you're like, hey, look, there's Timothy Hutton making fun of Tibet.  It doesn't really, you know, it doesn't really register that well.  It's not a really easy thing to explain in 30 seconds.  The deep level of satire they're aiming for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should have come with a manual.  Right.  A reader's guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To read more about what this ad was supposed to mean, go to Groupon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A viewer's guide to the Groupon commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, how about Joan Rivers?  Speaking of offensive things that turned out and turned it around, I think that Joan Rivers Go Daddy was brilliant, even though we don't like Go Daddy on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use Go Daddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll come out of the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a lot of registrars had had, you know, promotions ready to go like that moment, like, you know, drop Go Daddy, you know, leaving DG.  Like ready to get like Namecheap, I think, was one of them.  You know, they all had like promotions ready to go for like, hey, go daddy, go ahead and sign up with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were anticipating the fourth year of offensive ads like you didn't like the Go Daddy ad, like switch to us.  I mean, that's you know, that says something about about the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see the Joan Rivers one.  I saw the other one where they imply that two models are going to walk naked onto the set, but then they say go to the website to see the part.  Couldn't show on TV.  And I know.  Yeah.  And that was typical.  That's what I expected.  Adam, what was the Joan Rivers ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just you.  You're getting ready to see the body.  You're seeing the whole thing.  You see the legs.  Then finally, the lights go on and it's Joan Rivers with with with padding sufficient to to float an airline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the that's that's the same concept as Groupon.  No, it's different because they were making fun of themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  You want to think Joan Rivers is a cause.  Well, in some ways, maybe she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a living social ad that was like living social changed my life.  And it starts out with this guy.  And then you can see him like go get a mani-pedi and go admire these shoes and go get a makeup job done.  In the end, he's like a total transvestite like completely.  He's like, it changed my life.  And he kind of like sashays by.  I like that a lot better than I mean, I don't know how many like manly football watching guys thought it was better.  But I like that a lot better than than the Groupon take for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then Salesforce was there with their social networking tool for enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starring the black eyed peas is very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And but it really made me feel like it was nineteen ninety nine again.  Just seeing seeing kind of a cheesy dot com ad.  There were a lot of tech ads in the Super Bowl this year.  It says something about doing its buyback program.  All right. With Bieber, Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne, which, funnily enough, I actually knew that ad was coming for that product.  And after the ad was over, I had to stop and think to remember what it was for.  I didn't think they did a good job of explaining the buyback program, but it was very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a complicated program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because you have to pay in advance to be able to sell your device back later.  What?  Yeah.  That makes no sense.  Best Buy.  It's like buying insurance.  It's like, oh, you know, if I if you give us a little extra money now, then you'll be able to trade this in for the new phone, laptop, tablet, whatever, when it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you ever trust the people who are trying to sell you one hundred twenty dollar cables?  No.  Like, can you ever really say, oh, they must have a program based on merit and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the only thing about this one is the price is all set going in.  It's like the warranty stuff that should stores sell you, you know, as a rule doesn't work in this case.  I think the price is too high, but you use you know, you can sell it on your own on on eBay, which we all promise to and don't do.  We can use our wonderful about advertiser here on Twig.  Remind me of the name real quick.  Gazelle.  Thank you, Gazelle.  And now, obviously, it's worked well enough for Gazelle.  The Best Buy is getting into it.  You pay fifty nine ninety nine up front.  If you buy a thousand dollar thing in six months, they'll buy it back from you for five hundred bucks.  And that's guaranteed.  They're going down from 50 percent over six months down to 20 percent over two years.  Those prices are high.  Yes.  But the interesting thing is now to me, the bigger deal here is Gazelle proved a market.  They proved this middleman for second use to be able to trade in and get the new cool thing.  Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was fast as a as a big Best Buy shopper.  I would not trust them on any of this stuff, though.  It's probably not worth it.  You can easily go to Gazelle or there's a couple other Gazelle competitors out there that do the same sort of thing and get more money than you could get by having to pay in advance.  That's just I I go to a place like Best Buy because it's convenient because I don't want to have to wait for it to come in the mail.  Right.  All right.  Real quickly, Google got new office buildings down in L.A.  Frank Gehry designed office building there, apparently a travel destination.  If you can travel books, they are they're building with giant binocular shaped facade, a fixture in Venice, California, near the beach.  This was announced exactly the same day as Facebook announced their new corporate headquarters.  They're moving into the old Sun Campus in Menlo Park, often referred to as Sun Quentin because of its architecture.  Nice.  But, you know, everybody's getting big.  Everybody's expanding.  I don't know if there's much.  Yeah, I don't know if there's more to say about that.  Yeah, we're getting we're getting close to wrapping up.  So let's let's get into the tips.  Kevin, do you have one to pass along to us today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  And this was actually the source of a little back and forth on a Google group I saw recently.  The the email app for Android, so not the Gmail app, but the standard email if you were using your email through a corporate server or exchange or something like that.  You know, maybe Gina has a nicer way of putting it, but it kind of sucks.  The email app is not that great.  Or at least a lot of users have a lot of complaints about it.  And it's gotten a little better over the few Android versions.  But to a lot of people, it's not powerful enough.  It's nowhere close to as good as the Gmail app.  So search the Android market for K9 mail like you would say, you know, like a dog K9 and then mail.  And that is an app that continues to be pretty amazing in terms of supporting lots of different features, giving you all kinds of IMAP folder control.  Basically, if you don't like the email app on Android, you're going to love K9 mail.  There was a really interesting discussion recently, or at least I saw it recently, about whether or not it was going to get merged into the email app.  And because, you know, they're both open source projects and whatnot.  And Google has said that they're not going to just kind of wholesale import this kind of interesting fork of their email app.  But if there's if there's a feature that's missing from Android and from the email app, and it's probably in K9 mail.  So search the Android market for K9 mail, grab it.  And, you know, you'll have a lot more control and much more easy to use for your non Gmail email on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are my favorite moments in Twig when before you're even finished talking, I'm off searching right and downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and now you can grab it from the Android market.  You can go on the web browser right now and fling it to your device, which is such an amazing thing for bloggers in particular to be able to point people to actual web pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's amazing. PermaLynx to apps. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I know. Yeah, that's a huge innovation. It's letter K number nine, right? Right. Exactly.  All right, Gina, what do you got for us this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool. My tip is also for folks getting their email on their phone.  This is actually for Gmail users, the web based version of Gmail, which you're probably using if you use an iPhone, if you're not using the built in mail app now has priority in box support.  So if you've been using mail app, mail that app is it do you use mail that app on your iPhone, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't. I just use the I just use the built in like the built in mail. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The I use IMAP. IMAP.  If you use the web based version of Gmail and you have enabled priority inbox in your Gmail inbox, it now you can now have access to the priority inbox.  That's pretty nifty messages. Yeah. So the important messages, the messages that Google things are important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the messages that aren't from PR people. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you first go to Gmail on your in your web browser on your phone, you go to your regular inbox.  But if you tap on the menu button and go back, you can see that priority inbox will show up.  So you can see, you know, you can say just show me all the email marked as important and unread, which might be a little easier when you're working on a small screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's cool. You know, I, I don't I just I have the mail app and I have all my accounts.  I have a Yahoo and Gmail and a couple others. And so I just like to read it all in one place.  But, you know, I would like to take advantage of priority inbox. That's pretty that's pretty attractive. Cool.  All right. Mr. Jeff Jarvis, we have a number today.  A bit of a cheat. Is it OK? It's related to the big story of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Three hundred fifteen, which is three hundred fifty million dollars, which is the price that that AOL, of course, is paying for Huffington Post.  Much, much, much talk about that this week happened on Monday.  I weighed in. I think it's a smart move. I think that if you saw the PowerPoint that was leaked last week to Business Insider about AOL's content strategy,  it made it look quite like a mechanistic animal farm and really kind of show there isn't a content strategy.  Tim Armstrong's view is to be a gigantic content company so we can be a big, gigantic ad company.  Ariana, I think, brings humanity to that. She's been brilliant about getting people to want to use a platform.  Yes, some controversy to do it for free, but nobody puts a gun to their head. And she provides some value for that.  I cross post things at Huffington Post because I get seen and she has the value of aggregation and she understands the value of links and social.  Importantly, I think that Jonah Peretti, who was the head of technology at Huffington Post from the start, was getting no attention at this beginning.  But then people come back around saying, don't forget the value that Jonah added to Huffington Post to make it really easy to create incredible new applications and new metrics to make Huffington Post work.  So Ariana is going to take charge not just of Huffington Post, but also of all of the content at AOL, including, yes, even Michael Arrington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Gadget and TechCrunch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Josh Topolsky and Michael Arrington report to Ariana Huffington? We're sure about this. She's not just being brought in as a head of editorial, but she's out of the reporting chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's vice president in charge of all things content. So that'll be fun to watch.  Arrington definitely asked whether she was going to go to four-hour staff meetings like he's had to go to.  Nick Denton said that they gave out too early. Others said the price was too high.  You know, we'll see where this goes. But the interesting thing to me was in this that I asked Monday, you know, I've long asked, why didn't any publisher start Huffington Post?  Why didn't the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, BBC, the only company in the world that came close was starting, the Guardian, starting to come in as free, but more as a statement about the relationship with the public rather than as a business?  And I think the reason is because Huffington Post was just too populous. It gave too much respect to us, the people, and big media companies to this day can't quite swallow that.  Whereas AOL is looking for a content strategy and there is Ariana.  And, you know, I think that the final thing to say about this is that when she started, when Ariana sat down to the keyboard, lots of people laughed, including me.  I was wrong. She built an incredible company. And so now they're being paid $350 million for that.  So I think it's well worth watching where that goes.  Now, the next question becomes, of course, immediately, who's next?  Henry Blodgett was laughing on Twitter today that Andrew Ross Sorkin was asking him about the rumors that Business Insider is in play and Henry say, what am I supposed to say?  And Andrew saying, well, usually you should say that I don't comment on rumors.  And there's talk of maybe Gawker's up for sale.  And of course, I think the rumor we should start right now, here and now, before your very eyes, that Twit's in play.  It's huge.  And Leo's not off playing with penguins. He's negotiating with gigantic money out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Leo's out of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Either that or why don't we just sell it off underneath him?  Yeah.  He gets back and he has a new boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa, can you do that?  She signs the checks.  No, I... Wow. Can you imagine?  I can't. Actually, I can. And it frightens me.  I don't think that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think Leo would go to work for a big media company because he so disdains them.  That's why he's here.  Show them wrong. Why they'd be here.  But it is interesting to ask.  I mean, so that's why the New York Times, CNN, et al. never would have bought Huffington Post either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about something like a revision three or an ex new networks or, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the question. And so where do these kinds of companies go?  And is there a roll up for the likes of Twit?  I love talking about this behind Leo's back and we'll see what he says when he gets back.  But I think that what it says is, importantly, that these new media ventures,  such as the ones that Ariana and Leo have started, have real value.  And that they are truly new. And that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That memo that you were referring to earlier from AOL was scarily familiar to me.  And it's what happens when you have an editorial company that is no longer run by the editors.  Or not even no longer run, but where the editors no longer have a voice.  And I believe what Tim Armstrong is doing is trying to bring in strong editorial voices  to counter what he sees happening in his own company.  Because you could be the CEO of a company who believes strongly in content  and yet not be able to influence the people who work for you far enough that way.  And so you need to balance out the equation.  Because if they followed that, I mean, I know I've talked to some people who are really into SEO and into marketing.  They thought that memo was brilliant. That's exactly what, you know, it's like, no, there's huge imbalances in that  regarding the quality of content and things that are going to end up narrowing and blowing off your audience.  The only question I have about Ariana Huffington is, will she be too divisive internally?  Because she has a public persona of being a partisan and having a particular political point of view.  And now she's going to be in charge of a gadget blog, but TechCrunch more, I think, to the point that  I could see a lot of headbutting there, which would be less productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me put it this way, Tom. I think that Ariana could charm even Michael Lurrington.  Wow. OK. Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let's finish up real quick. I've got a tool for you.  I have just recently switched over to Chrome as my primary browser.  One of the things I miss from Firefox, thank you, is NoScript.  I am a huge fan of NoScript. And when I say primary browser, I mean that.  I still use Firefox and Opera and Safari, you know, in varying amounts.  But Chrome has become my go-to.  And so I found NoScript at Chrome.Google.com slash extensions.  You can just do a search for NoScripts and Chrome and you should find it.  NoScript allows you to take control of the scripts in a very NoScript-like way.  There's a few limitations in the way Chrome handles its API that don't allow it to do exactly what NoScript does.  And they're actually very good in the documentation of laying out what it is that they don't do and what workarounds you could have.  For instance, you can turn off Java. You can turn off JavaScripting in Chrome and then allow NoScript to whitelist stuff.  It's a little more. It's a little less convenient than NoScript.  It also doesn't provide some of the clickjacking protection that NoScript does.  But hey, it's the best thing I've found.  The only real disadvantage of it is you have to set up a password for it in a user file yourself.  You have to go use a text editor. Not that big a deal. Just again, not very convenient.  But once you got it up and running, it just gives you a little pyramid up in the address bar that you can click on and you can approve scripts temporarily.  You can approve scripts forever for certain sites.  It comes with a whitelist preloaded so that things like Google.com are already there and you can edit that whitelist yourself.  So it's better to me than any kind of naked running on the Internet that you would have to do otherwise.  So I recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Naked running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I feel like when I'm just allowing any script to execute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's the kind of thing I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're in Amsterdam though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's lots of naked running in Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No bicycle riding.  I actually rode a bicycle tonight to lunch and to dinner because there's no cabs in this weird hotel I'm in.  Out in the middle of nowhere in the suburbs of Amsterdam.  So there I am looking rather like a scene out of The Wicked Witch of the West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they've got an entire garage full of bikes though at the hotel, right?  Yes.  Amsterdam's a bike city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you naked though? That's the question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too cold.  It's always the question.  Not this time of year.  All right.  Thanks everybody for being on the show.  Kevin Purdy, let folks know about your book and where they can find your work on Lifehacker.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at lifehacker.com, which has a brand-spaking new design that you may or may not have heard about.  And at the Complete Android Guide, which is completeandroidguide.com, which is a how-to guide for Android and is getting updated now to include things like canine mail.  Gina Trapani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin.  Yes.  You can tell us what do you think of the design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like writing for Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I'll tell you, Jeff.  I like the new design.  Well done.  I'm a big fan of Lifehacker and io9.  And you know what?  You can scroll down in that right side forever if you want to see the headlines of things.  It works fine for me.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, Kevin.  I enjoyed that.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I enjoy entering text in the CMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that we've endangered Kevin's job, Gina, how are things going at smarterware.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things are growing great.  Thank you, Tom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smarterware.org or on Twitter.  And you should buy my app.  It's search for to-do text.  Android Market.  That's my awkward plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am also a big fan of ThinkUp.  I run it as well, especially now that I can just run it with auto updates through the  RSS.  It's great.  Take a look at ThinkUp as well, folks.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you for staying up and being with us in your wonderfully lit hotel  room.  I feel like I'm being interrogated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait to put this back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know the lengths this man went to to even be able to appear in some kind of  light.  So we thank him for that.  Of course, buzzmachine.com and let people know where else they can find you on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty much it.  Working on the book Public Parts, the first manuscript edits going on with the editor  right now.  So we're getting there out this year.  Congrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations.  That's great.  I'm not there yet.  I mean, you know, getting that far is still worth it.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  No small shakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leo Laporte will be out for one more this week in Google.  So I'll be back next week hosting with Jeff and Gina and then we will be back in two weeks.  Thanks, everybody, for watching or listening.  We'll see you next time.
