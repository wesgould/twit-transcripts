Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  And the author of, oh, I, you know what?  I was going to bring it out because I have all your books.  I realized I have all your books on my bookshelf spread around.  So I had a stack.  Anyway, what would Google do?  Public parts, his latest Gutenberg the geek and geek sparing news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't you amazing you have this memorized?  But you repeated it about 100 times so nicely.  I have them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've read them all.  I'm a fan.  And of course, he blogs regularly at buzzmachine.com.  So there's a lot more to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Irregularly now I'd say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I, I, I, I re-started my blog and leoville.com and I, with all good intentions,  posted this about four posts is typical, right?  And then you lose interest.  Yeah, I know.  It makes me sad, but I got to figure it out.  Yeah.  I have a lot of posts in mind.  I know what I want to write.  I have the content.  I just have to sit down and write.  Writing's hard.  That's why I have respect for you and Ron Amadio, who is from ours.  Technic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He sits down to write.  Does he ever write?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the longest article you've written on ours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  History of Android was 40,000 words.  That's a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a book, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a small book.  It's a novella.  That's what my editor told me when he had to look through all that.  Poor guy.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anyway, great to have you both talk about Google and the Google verse.  Ron did write, I would say is probably a fairly lengthy article.  Definitive, I would call it.  And definitive no less.  The 2016 Google tracker.  Not your first time doing this, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Usually I do it twice a year before I.O. and at the beginning of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's announced the dates for I.O. by the way, so we now know when you'll be writing  your next one.  This is everything Google's working on for 2016.  And I imagine this has increased in complexity thanks to Alphabet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's way longer than last year's.  Yeah, I just try to cover all the, yeah, all those little weird satellite companies and  everything Google's doing.  And it's interesting how fast they move and how many different projects.  And actually that is obsolete now because Google X isn't Google X anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The minute you press send, it was obsolete, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've done about six different versions of that little graphic while I was making  this and still making more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's Google X called now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just X.  There's no Google anymore.  So the theory is that all the Alphabet companies that left Google that still have Google brand  names are going to drop the Google brand.  They have to, right?  Yeah.  That would make a little more sense.  But right now there's still Google Capital and Google self-driving cars and something  else that has a Google brand name, but it's not part of Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what you need to do, by the way, is rename the Google tracker to the tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, the Alphabet tracker.  I don't know.  Alphabet's scary to put in a title.  It is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not.  Yeah, we're never going to call this show this week in Alphabet.  Weird brand name.  Yeah.  Sounds like Sesame Street.  She is for cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cookie.  That's good enough for me, cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think among other things, there's quite a few things to talk about in here, but one  is one that I've been harping on, which is a new messaging app, Goodbye Google Hangouts,  you ask.  And we've heard, of course, the Wall Street Journal's reported about chat bots and so  forth.  But Google does have or had Google Talk, G Plus Messenger, Google Voice, Hangouts is  their current.  And then if you're using Android, there's a Google SMS Messenger.  That's at least five solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the plan was to kind of have Google Plus sort of take over all of this  and then Google Plus kind of failed.  So now they need it failed, at least as a Facebook competitor.  So now they need some kind of messaging solution.  But I mean, they've never really given Hangouts the attention that it needs.  It could have been so good.  And yeah, and especially when you've got Facebook buying WhatsApp for however many billions  of dollars and WeChat is so big in China and Snapchat's worth however many billion dollars.  It's like everybody else understands that messaging is this big kind of kind of new  social area.  As weird as that sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more than that.  It's a platform.  And that's why it's something you can't ignore.  If we're just a new social network, big deal.  But it's a platform.  When you look at what WeChat does, it's as much an operating system as anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can buy stuff through WeChat and everything else.  Google is just so far behind on this, where every other major tech company other than,  like you said, Microsoft seems to be seems to get that messaging is a big deal and invest  so much money in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually were talking on Windows Weekly about that.  Microsoft has also missed the ball on messaging, killed MSN Messenger and replaced it with Yammer  on the business side, which has not gone very well.  And Skype on the consumer side.  And then there kind of is a middle ground, which is Skype for business, none of which  are very compelling.  And because Microsoft's and this is an interesting issue, doesn't have a strong mobile play.  Windows Phone is not going anywhere.  They need to figure something out.  And we were thinking maybe Microsoft and Google should join forces.  That's the only, in my opinion, the only way you can stop them.  At this point, the unstoppable Facebook Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, like WeChat and WhatsApp don't really have great desktop clients.  So I think Google could do very well if they made something that kind of worked on every  device you've got.  Because my big problem with Facebook Messenger is there's really no desktop app.  There's really no desktop app for WhatsApp or any of those other things.  For me, it's hard to get those messages sometimes if I'm working on a real computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As someone who uses both iPhone and Android, I use Hangouts because that's the most cross  platform solution.  It's kind of stunted.  Well, I don't know.  Is it stunted?  I can't do animated GIFs.  Is that really a drawback?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it can now.  I think they added that.  But it's very, it has very low resources at Google.  It's not a favored product over there.  And you can definitely feel it.  And all the clients are a little bit different, which makes jumping around kind of hard.  And even for communication stuff, like the emoji set is different on all of them now.  Like Android supports new ones, but the desktop app doesn't.  And it's super weird.  But the new thing, as weird as chatbot sound, it kind of sounds like they're taking it  in an app direction or like a platform direction where people will be able to make these chatbots  and you'll be able to dig through them or Google will dig through them and find the  good ones.  It sounds like they're finally trying to make something that is a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google should buy Telegram.  I don't know if Telegram is even for sale.  It's kind of a weird open source slash business thing because Telegram has bots.  They have all the features that Google would want.  They could really benefit from recoding the encryption.  I think Telegram is a great alternative that isn't going anywhere by itself because they're  by themselves.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, if you go down to the bottom of the rundown under numbers, don't worry, I got plenty.  David Marcus, the VP of messaging products at Facebook, has a really interesting post,  I think, about where he sees it going.  He has 800 million people on Messenger each month and he has five, well really four, kind  of predictions of what he's going to concentrate on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Darth Vader writing about what he plans to do with the Death Star, folks.  You should read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It is.  It's fascinating to me.  The first one he predicts this year, the death of the phone number.  Now I'm not so sure that's so quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Facebook's been trying to do this for a long time, right?  I would love it if they get rid of the phone number.  I would love it if they could use the name.  But so did Twitter.  Remember, the at Leo Laporte was my phone number.  Twitter wanted this to be the...  Right now, I guess the alternative to the phone number is your email address.  But email is not a good messaging platform.  It's not as immediate as phone calls.  With Facebook Messenger, you can make phone calls, audio, video, you can message.  But what they don't have right now, what is your Facebook?  Do you know, Jeff, what your Facebook handle is on Messenger?  No.  No.  What is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They need to solve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they need to solve that.  We don't need to know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just say type my name into the Facebook search box and you'll probably have some kind  of friends and comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the Facebook search is much better.  I mean, Ron, Ron Amadio is not a common name and there actually are a fair number of Jeff  Jarvis's.  The problem I have is Facebook search, they've been saying it's getting better in bits, but  I want to find the Joe Smith who blank to blank to blank.  It's still hard to find the right Joe Smith if you're not already friends with Joe.  Well here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Messenger, as close as it is right now on the Macintosh for the desktop.  If you go to Messenger.com, this is a web page.  So if I type Jeff Jarvis, only because I'm following you, I find you right away.  You're not just following me, Leo.  We're friends.  We're friends.  But if this is going to succeed, it needs to be, I need to be, okay, look, number one  messaging system that would make it killer is I can get to anybody.  Because right now, if you buy a phone, you expect to be able to dial anybody's phone  number anywhere.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no messaging app today gets that.  But what is Facebook?  Even if you hear people say, oh, young people don't use Facebook anymore, the one thing  I then hear the next sentence is, but every young person has to have a Facebook account.  It is the closest thing we have to universal identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I use Facebook Messenger.  As much as I hate to, it pains me to admit it, I think it's the winner.  But I'm really curious what David Marcus, if he says we're going to replace the disappearing  phone number, well, what is the analog in Facebook world?  Is it searching for your name?  I don't think that's it.  Shouldn't there be like an at Jeff Jarvis and an at Ronimodio that's unique?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Identifier.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there's vanity URLs you could sign up for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have Leo G Laporte, but I don't think anybody would know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  He points out to you don't have to have a Facebook account to use Messenger.  Well then if you're OK, then how would I use it then?  How would I find you?  That explodes.  I guess phone numbers?  No, it doesn't.  Yes.  No, it is phone number.  Phone number.  Right.  So then you have to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know anybody's phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I don't know.  What's fascinated me most is the ambition of this is once you have that closest to universal  service, the three says threads are the new apps.  And we're thinking, I hope you interact with businesses or services to buy items, order  rides, purchase airline tickets, talk to customer service and truly frictionless and delightful  ways, though I've never had a delightful experience with customer service.  It's kind of say here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what would be delightful?  Not having to talk to customers.  Amen.  And by the way, for 100 bucks an hour, you can have a personal assistant using a Messenger  app do it for you.  And I think you're going to see more and more of that as well.  And that's the whole platform aspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about $500 an hour to deal with Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They charge it premium.  Surge pricing has kicked in.  So threads, what does he mean by threads when he says threads are the new apps?  Is that a message thread?  You see there isn't an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess there's a thread.  I agree.  I mean, I agree.  Yeah.  And it carries a history, he says, of your interaction with that company.  So the problem is when I was going through my Verizon hell that I recounted, don't worry,  I won't do it again.  Last week, they would lose the thread constantly.  Oh yeah, I'll make a note of that in the file.  BS, found nowhere.  And now you have a demonstrable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why Slack is so huge in the enterprise, because you have a record.  Yes, that's true.  And it's better than email.  I mean, email, you have a record too, but it seems somehow better than email.  Search ability, very important.  Google could do well, but you know what has happened here is that Dave Marcus, VP of Messaging  at Facebook, has given Google a roadmap.  Roadmap, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what-  Google doesn't have the identity structure there.  Now, by the way, it says that brands are showing that interactions will happen more and more  in your messenger threads.  Have you ever interacted with a brand on Messenger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you can do that.  I mean, so you're friends with Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's no way to delegate this.  Like there's one Facebook login that Verizon has, right?  All the messages go to this one dude at Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Believe me, Facebook will figure this out.  How do you keep messaging from going down the same road email went?  Email was all of this and great, and then because there was so much of it and so many  and you were- the problem with emails, anybody can send you an email.  As soon as anybody can send you a message, how do you keep this from becoming email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it becomes sender controlled, it's doomed.  If it's recipient controlled, that's where Google Plus- I remember Google Plus.  That's where Google Plus had an advantage.  This is the Mike Elgin argument about no spam is because it was recipient controlled.  But it wasn't universal, Lord knows.  So Google had a plan.  Yeah, they had an architecture to beat it.  But we need to rethink- we're saying, messages taken over the world, messages taken over  the world.  Well, yeah, but it's not really thought out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and it could end up just like email, which was the last thing to take over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could.  A permissioned messenger system with universal identity we don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A permiss- oh yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the phone wasn't that because of course you could get junk calls and that's why legislation  was then enacted to get rid of that.  So it was sender controlled to that extent, but the recipient controlled to the extent  that you could decide not to answer the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And do you want to go to Verizon or Comcast and have a persistent conversation with them  living in your messaging app?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bubble showing up.  How you doing today?  Jeff, you want to buy another service?  No.  Yeah, that's spam.  I'm trying to buy the car, as you know, on the show.  And I went and did the Costco and the USAA car thing.  So now I'm getting non-stop- I'm not ready yet folks, I'm not ready.  Non-stop calls.  Non-stop emails.  Yeah.  So no, you don't want to open up to brands where they have the control of the communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ron, what do you use for- do you do messaging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm kind of forced to use Facebook Messenger because that's what people kind  of contact me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know everybody's going to be on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mostly- I try to use Hangouts as much as possible.  I prefer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's because you're an Android user and Hangouts makes a lot of sense for Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not just that.  It's, you know, I have a Mac and a Windows desktop and I can get Hangouts on all of that  stuff as a background app that runs everywhere.  And when you message me on Hangouts, all of my devices beep.  And sometimes that's like 15 devices depending on how busy I am right now.  Where Facebook Messenger, because I'm not automatically logged into it because it's  not on any of my desktops, like one phone somewhere beeps and I'm a lot slower to respond  to Facebook Messenger than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hangouts is a- right now is a Chrome widget, which means you have to have Chrome running  for Hangouts to work on your desktop.  Should they make a standalone app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  So the two different Chrome extensions that are there run in the background.  Even if Chrome's not running?  Right.  Even if a Chrome window is not running.  Chrome, if it's on your computer, is usually running all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's your computer.  If I close Chrome, I don't get Hangouts messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah you will if you install the extensions.  If you install the extensions, yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh I haven't installed.  It's always there.  There's also hangouts.google.com and it's in Gmail and is it still in Google Plus?  It is in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It used to be in Google Plus.  But I feel like they need a native app for these platforms as well.  I like having a native app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google doesn't have a native app for anything.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just Chrome.  That's not how Google rolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how Google rolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That they build on now.  I really like Telegram still and I wish that Google would buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Google tried to buy the company behind the Telegram chatbot service which is called  200 Labs.  Don't Google that because you won't find anything.  I tried.  But they tried to buy that company and they said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia that started this.  And chased from Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  He's an amazing guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pavel Durov.  He kind of lives nowhere now I think.  Yeah.  Well because basically Putin forced the sale of his company to the government.  But he got some money out of it.  He founded the social network site VK.  And then he and his brother who was a mathematician created Telegram.  And I think I can't remember what country Telegram is out of.  It's not out of Russia.  None of them are in.  They're not in Russia anymore.  VKontakte.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  VKontakte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  VKontakte.  So some people might say well I don't really trust a guy who has connections with Putin.  But I think he's the opposite.  I think it's the opposite.  Yeah.  Because the Russian Federal Security Service said you must hand over personal details of  users.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not much of a future in that.  Yuri Milner.  If I'm correct I think Yuri made his beginning of his fortune with mail.ru and VKontakte.  I think he was a Pavel mentor as I remember.  And Yuri I think is also out of Russia.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Telegram, which I think really is mostly run by his brother Nikolai, said no to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the company, it's 200 Labs, which is the company behind Telegram's chatbot service

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or technology or something like that.  Oh that's right.  They do the chatbots.  That's not Telegram.  That's right.  I remember reading that.  You know, by the way, Telegram is open source so anybody can write a Telegram client, which  is another brilliant move.  Telegram could be the next Android and I could really easily see Google snapping it up and  saying all right we got a platform.  That'd be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, you know this all gets superseded.  You know what takes over at all?  What?  Peach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Peach is so last week.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  And so I really for about 10 minutes was excited about Peach.  I thought finally something that can kill Twitter.  Then I decided not.  I said I was completely, I must have been drunk.  Hangouts is good.  If Google put all of its efforts behind it.  I'm sad that they killed the XMPP, the Jabber backbone that was for Google Talk because  well, maybe I'm not technical enough to understand the issues with it, but it was my feeling  that that had some real future as a standard.  The reason I care about this is because if Facebook is about to win, and we've talked  about this before, I really, I think Dave is saying here's what we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean Messenger is successful because it got built into Facebook.  It kind of got that bump of initial users and whatever Google builds could do the same  thing just by building it into Android and into Gmail and all that stuff, which everybody  hates on Google Plus for doing.  But if you want to win messaging right now, that's what you have to do.  You have to say, we're just going to push this out to all our users and hope that they  use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And make a strong Apple client, an iOS client.  Because you've got to work on iOS too.  This is the fundamental mistake Apple is making, which is that because their Messenger client  is Apple only, they can never win.  Blackberry, man.  Blackberry.  They thought BBM was going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They thought they had it.  They thought they'd win.  Yeah, and in certain small groups they did, but they didn't win the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  When we come back, I want to talk about Remix because you talk about Android everywhere.  We've been talking for a long time about the Pixel C and how Google kind of fumbled what  could have been a world-changing product.  We continue with the road map for 2016, the 2016 Google tracker, Ronam Audio at Ars Technica.  You want to follow along in the playbook at ArsTechnica.com.  And Jeff Jarvis is here.  I showed it.  They brought you by Credit Karma, a free app.  A free app that is going to tell you something very important, a number that counts a lot.  More than your weight, more than your blood pressure, more than your...  It's your credit score.  Credit Karma.com.  45 million people have now joined Credit Karma.com because they need to know their credit score.  Your credit score is what determines everything.  Many of the websites that offer credit reports are confusing and worse come with fees, hidden  fees.  I went to one that said it was free.  It wasn't.  Credit Karma does things differently.  They offer truly free credit reports with no strings attached and no credit card required.  They couldn't charge you if they wanted to.  They don't just show you a score and send you away.  They actually break it down so you can see what actions have affected that score, what  things you could do to improve it and to make their services even easier to access.  They have the free mobile apps on iOS and Android.  45 million members turned to Credit Karma to check their credit score.  Why aren't you is the question.  This is free free, as in it costs nothing free.  Credit Karma.  Get it right now on your phone or go to Credit Karma.com to find out more.  You may not get to those ab crunches in your New Year's resolution, but this is a good  one that will help you feel more comfortable and confident about your financial fitness.  Get your free credit report today.  Credit Karma.com.  We were playing before the show and I guess I should show it with this thing that just  came out, Remix OS.  You have a piece of hardware, Ron, that they sent you that runs Remix OS, but you can download  it from jide.com and install it on a USB key and then run it on any laptop.  They say some Macs, some Windows boxes.  On my Dell, I'm running it on a Dell, but I had to in order to get it to work on the  Dell turn off UEFI and secure boot and all of that.  Now it's going to sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need a 64-bit computer and a bunch of weird other settings that might work and might  not.  It's based on the Android x86 project, which has been going on for a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a Google project or is that an open source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a big open source project.  It actually started before the whole official Intel support thing started from Google.  If you go there, there is a hardware compatibility list, which should apply to most of Remix as  well.  But apparently, the little tiny box that I got has a lot of differences.  There's a lot of differences between that software and the software that you can download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have Google services, for instance, on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, the biggest of which is apparently all the Google apps.  You can't change your resolution and I totally could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not really the point.  This is not...  They even say it on the website.  Don't expect a usable operating system.  But what's interesting is they're showing a very clear path to making Android a desktop  operating system.  Something that, for instance, would really be great on the Pixel C, Google.  In fact, that was the first thing you asked, Jeff, is can I put it on my Pixel C?  Yeah.  But you can't because this is an ARM device and that's really x86.  It's designed for x86.  But I suspect that that's what Google was working on and they couldn't get going in  time to get it out for the C. Right, Ron?  I mean, wasn't that the rumor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The rumor is they want to merge Chrome and Android and kind of turn Android into a desktop  operating system.  And Remix is kind of a third party's idea of what that would look like.  With menu bar and desktop.  It's designed for a mouse and keyboard though and the Pixel C has no mouse.  So as much of a wonderful dream as that would be, it would probably not be that great.  I don't know if you need a mouse.  You can plug an external mouse into the Pixel C.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could use a mouse, but I think touch does everything a mouse would do, doesn't it?  Because right click is long press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The big advantages are things like selecting text and just whenever you're typing in one  like fiddle with whatever sentence.  It's easier with a mouse.  It's horrible with touch and yeah, with a mouse it's really nice.  And Remix adds some of that to some of the Google apps.  It turns out that all the Google apps and most other Android apps all implement text  fields in different ways.  So you get all sorts of wacky consistencies where sometimes you'll get that little like  eye shaped mouse cursor thing that blinks and you can highlight text and then some of  it just works like a finger tap and you don't get the fun mouse highlighting.  So it's a really weird operating system.  What's wrong with it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is it broken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It went to sleep and I can't wake it up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the box would do that too and you just have to kill power and start it over from  scratch.  So pull the battery.  See if that works.  Can you pull the battery in that thing?  Hold down power forever.  That's memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't do that anymore.  No, I can do it.  I just press the off switch.  See, something comes up but that's all I see and now I'll just power down and reboot.  I'm booting off of a USB key so this is not the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the story of Remix OS.  It is not super stable.  It's not really done.  It's very hacky but it's fun to play with for a few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's a product but it's kind of more this shows the way I think for  what a desktop Android could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm about to go out of town and so I'm now stupidly carrying the Pixel...  Which one do I have here?  The Pixel C at the same...  So I have Android and the little Asus Flip.  I have a Chromebook because sometimes when I'm working on a text or something you need  the Chromebook but this little one is slow but I don't really want to carry my huge Chromebook  Pixel for 10 days out of town.  It's driving me nuts as to which one am I using now and why am I using it and switching  back and forth and I haven't come to any grand conclusions yet but it's frustrating that  these two OSs are coming closer together but there's still a gulf between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Android really isn't a desktop...  It's suitable for desktop work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things I found interesting when I tried that out is like on an Android tablet  when you have a phone app it's like it really sucks.  You're like bummed out and there's this giant phone app that stretches out sideways and  it's a big pain to use but when you have a windowed operating system if you have a phone  app it's not that bad because the phone app just sits in a little box this big and you  just kind of use it at the... because it's the size it was intended to be using it is  not the agony that an Android tablet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Facebook's right and it's the end of the phone number it's probably the end of the  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You still need a personal communication device regardless of what you want to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a personal communicator.  It doesn't have to be phone size.  A Pixel C could be your personal communicator especially if we go wireless which Apple's  going to push forward because apparently they're removing the headphone jack from the next  iPhone.  So all your headphones and everything will be wireless.  That means if you've got...  Now you all need to carry a man purse, all you men, because you need to carry bigger  devices in your carry all and have your earbuds or your wearable or I guess it could be your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  watch or your...  Yeah I mean as somebody that's had Bluetooth headphones for years and years and preferred  them the one sucky thing is that they're all huge because they take batteries and you've  got to charge them all the time because they take batteries.  So your typical pack away stuff goes from instead of having a little corded headphone  you've got to bring your bulky headphones and the charger for them and the charger for  your phone and the charger for your laptop and yeah it's rough.  We need USB-C everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're getting there.  We're getting closer and closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's the other thing.  So now carrying power on this trip it got more complicated again.  I mean it's headed in the right direction.  But for a while it's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you need is what I have here.  I showed this on MacBreak Weekly.  This is from a company called Zolt.  Z-O-L-T.  I can't remember the website is get Zolt or something like that.  This is a charger, very compact charger that comes with you know they don't have I don't  know if they have a USB type-C connector but it has it is a laptop charger that capable  of 65 watts and then it has two additional smaller USB so you can charge everything from  this so you could have a USB-C cable coming off of this.  I have they sent it.  I didn't buy it.  They sent it with a Mac compatible laptop charger.  So you plug that in you charging your Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was that MagSafe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They offer MagSafe tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh wow.  Oh that's super not legal.  I'd imagine Apple.  I'm sure they licensed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This looks licensed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know Apple doesn't I know I've never seen one do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like it's so hard to get MagSafe.  I love MagSafe.  I'm really bummed that they put USB type-C on the new MacBooks but it's really hard to  get MagSafe stuff.  Yeah maybe.  I always end up getting it on eBay from China.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Illegal MagSafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Illegal fire hazard.  Which is kind of like an illegal man base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this you plug in.  So you plug in.  Now it's not it's not going to charge your MacBook as fast as an Apple charger will because  it's only I think 65 watts.  But and if you have you know it's total.  So if you have but you could trickle charge a phone you could do a tablet.  So that's what you need Jeff.  And it's pretty compact.  And then it all wraps up into a little thing.  And what you need is a USB-C cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's going to stick really far out of whatever electrical socket you plug in.  But it rotates which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can you can manage to get it somewhere.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But just does it can it not stick like a foot out of the wall or however long that is because  just a lot of the planes and hotel rooms and stuff that or that I end up on that would  be in the way.  I want like a wire at the end of it that I can plug in and then a little box can dangle  somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just bring an extension cord.  So picky.  Little extension cord with you.  This isn't that far.  This is four and a half five inches.  OK.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  It's 100 bucks.  It's a result.  So you go like that.  That's not too far out.  That could sit on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So with a USB-C I could charge my new Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh.  And your phone.  And your Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was cool.  It was mean of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your your phone your laptop your headphones your watch.  Yeah.  Your Google Glasses.  Yeah.  You need more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need more of these.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But yeah I mean I think it's all going to go type C and then it'll be easier.  Yeah.  Life will be because that's a standard.  You know this is the really silly thing.  This comes from the era when you had to have different tips for every laptop.  So it comes with like 10 tips.  Yeah.  These little silly tips.  Then a special kind of cable that goes into the tips.  It's really crazy.  Oh God I remember those days.  Remember that.  Oh.  Type C please.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Asus takes what?  A regular takes a special plug.  It takes a special plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well this looks like a USB but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if they'll they think they'll have a tip for it.  And then if they did then this would be a good solution for you.  I love Chrome OS and I think that Android could be.  I mean this remix kind of gave me renewed vigor around the idea of a desktop Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're they're they're making it.  You say that in the road map you say 2017 but you say they will do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah the preview version supposed to be out this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would guess it happens at Google I.O. where they say here's the desktop stuff that we have so far.  And developers are kind of going to need to wrap their head around it and start making desktop apps.  And they'll hopefully get feedback because that's that's kind of the pattern now where Google comes up with this new thing and they release it at I.O.  And everybody gets to play with it for six months in a developer preview.  Like I think they've realized that secrecy is not super important anymore and they're more interested in in having a beta and getting stuff right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai made the announcement.  He says I.O. 16 coming to the neighborhood where it all started 10 years ago.  Shoreline amphitheater.  So what is going to be tense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was hoping to talk to you about this Leo as a as someone from California.  Have you ever been to.  Oh yeah many times.  It's a concert venue.  They got a nice lawn area.  OK so how does food work.  How does hotels work.  Because if you look on Google Maps for everybody else there's like there's a shoreline amphitheater and then it's like Google all around it like just thousands of buildings and then above it is the ocean.  And you're it's like I don't know it's like trying to get stuff done in the middle of Disneyland or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's I think the hotels the hotels on the peninsula are just are few and awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's not it's not the city by any means.  The it would be fine for a keynote because it's a it's a big venue.  I mean you can you know I don't know 10,000 people I don't know off to look up.  But it doesn't have conference facilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So all those breakouts will that be back at the Google campus maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it would have to be.  That's probably what I'm thinking is that.  Yeah there's what is that.  There's the amphitheater see in the nice lawn area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I guess that goes against the green the lawn.  Twenty two thousand five hundred.  That's including the line at twenty two five sixty five hundred reserve seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sixteen hundred that's probably what they'll use and maybe they'll set up table now but the lawn sloped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then and then above that is about rain.  And from from their south all the way down to like the highway is just nonstop Google buildings.  And they're all high security because they're Google buildings like you can walk around outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe the parking lot.  I don't know.  I don't know how they do the breakouts stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so the the theory since it's like a semi outside venue the theories is like oh you know the the Willy the Willy Wonka factory will be in full effect and they'll have you know self driving cars come out and get you and you'll go to the venue and they'll have all these.  Oh I want a golden ticket.  Just just that it's outside the theory is there's going to be lots of cars lots of drone stuff.  That's a lot of theory.  Which I mean they could make all that stuff electric and do it at Moscone to I would maybe.  I don't know.  But the car theory is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May 18th 19th and 20th.  Well that's longer than usual right.  No three days now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It used to be it was three and then it went to two and now it's back to three again.  So it's it's slightly longer which is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course tickets will be hard to get.  They haven't announced how that's going to work yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ridiculous even a week before we're not sure what's going to be announced.  But nonetheless Ron you've suggested one thing that's going to be done at Google I.O. What else do you think might be coming to Google I.O.  What's what's percolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh that's this is going to be a good year for I.O.  Don't you think.  I think so.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it I.O.  lately has really turned into the Android show.  So they will have a new version of Android.  I think it's it's just a question of whether it is Android and which they keep talking about or this Android Chrome hybrid or if they're the same thing.  I like I said I think that the Chrome Android version comes out at I.O.  because that's what the Wall Street Journal report said.  It's like it's coming out in 2016.  Oh and I.O. makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The end of the year because you want to get people developing for it before you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then you want to have a bunch of talks about how to do all this new desktop stuff and like it's not just it's all this logistical stuff they want to talk to developers about.  So they can tell them how to implement a right click menu correctly and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Sundar Pichai was the Chrome OS guy.  Why would why would he.  I mean if you make an Android desktop doesn't that.  I mean it's Chrome is or you're going to merge them right or what.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah the idea is you take the sort of the best of Chrome and Android and mash them together.  Hopefully that means they work on a ground up revamp of Android where they fix the update situation and.  All of that stuff and mostly it's I think mostly it's Android attacking a new form factor which is the PC.  I mean they've already got it running on on phones and tablets and cars and watches and televisions.  So going to PCs seems like a pretty obvious step when it runs on everything else on Earth.  And then other than that this is the first I.O. since the whole alphabet thing happened.  So who knows what their who else wants to show up to the party or if they want to.  Oh that I.O.  So that's not a good.  Well that's a question.  Is it a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai announced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is good.  So Sundar announced this is a Google alone.  Everything else is a separate company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah and mostly everything else is not a commercial product like there's Nest and then everything else is investments in super deep research.  And but you know they might have they might have some people show up just to no announcements but show up to just wow the journalists and developers.  I think we'll have breakout sessions and self driving buses.  Yeah you know there's always there's always like bartending robots and all this other weird stuff there that I'm sure people oh robots there we go.  The all the Boston Dynamics stuff they could have their little robot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you like to ride a dog back to your breakout session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With like their stroke gasoline engines it sound like.  Yeah that'll be great.  Nice and peaceful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why hasn't you know F8 is really more of a developers developer.  Facebook's conference.  Yeah right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that's because Facebook is a is a software company.  Is a purely a software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what what made Google I.O. different was the fact that there was hardware.  And they were giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Different in terms of in terms of what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just kind of the kind of excitement and press that happens around it.  Physical stuff is always more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Notice that all the coverage is always of the stuff in the lobby the physical.  Yeah you get pictures of it.  It's software so abstract it's really hard to talk about.  Well I mean it's a cool strategy where you kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the dog.  You get developers excited about everything that's happening and then at the same time say oh you're excited about this you can learn about how to do it right now like.  Make your app today.  Yeah.  You know that they can do all that but also just that they invite the press.  I mean Google had the ubiquity conference this week about the Internet of Things and they talked about weave and burlough and all that other stuff and nobody cares because they didn't they didn't invite the press or really hype it up for or.  We didn't even cover it.  Yeah and it was a hardcore developer conference like it was streamed online.  You can watch it.  It's like nitty gritty tech details like Google has for real developer conferences all the time and they have design conferences now too.  But just you know I always is the Super Bowl and it's cool to have a show like that but it's not the only developer show.  Tell us about time full.  Time full was what was that that was it was something that they acquired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a it was a AI calendar AI.  Oh right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh right.  This thing this thing would scan your schedule and so you would tell it what you want to do like I want to work out three times this week and it would look at your schedule and make it say you have time here here and here where you could do your work.  I would hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have enough people nagging me to do things I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know Leo you really could be working out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also the idea that my entire life is in my calendar which it is not you know the the important stuff is in my calendar.  I get mostly the work stuff is in my calendar but if it's like I'm going to go to dinner with a friend like I don't need to put that in a calendar.  I'm going to remember and it's like this it takes this weird view of the world where your entire life is in your calendar and I think for most people that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No you're right.  So my messenger.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  If it could scan that and figure stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking we're looking at my calendar with a couple colleagues so they can they can.  Lisa has my calendar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so I put it so my colleagues give me this well you have this big this this thing is going on for five days like the food thing with it.  What the hell are you talking about?  My calendar is not there.  I realize there's that horrible thing where people can put something on your calendar without your permission.  And I turned that off.  But now there's stuff appearing on my calendar to other people that I'm not actually doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah a lot of times Google will scan your Gmail now and say oh someone invited you to this so we put it on your calendar for you.  You're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And sometimes we add invitations to my calendar and I said no only the invitations I responded to.  However it was showing them to other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh oh wow.  OK.  That's weird.  So so what what app was that because there's because Gmail does it and I'm sure there's like a Google I'm sure there's multiple things that do that.  No I can't see it because it's not me.  So the thing on this list I'm excited about is that the virtual reality stuff which they just announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just yeah they reorg around it didn't they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah they just kind of made the division official and they have a guy running it now or a different person running it.  I don't know somebody was running it before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John White. Is it John Wiley who is.  He's in the division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's in the team.  That's the thing about it.  So Google does cardboard today which really seems like it seems like a joke.  I mean it's a product but it just seems like it's not a really serious product that anybody's ever going to fall in love with.  But the amount of people working in the Google VR team is really just stunning like the the the MVPs of Google have have kind of left to go work on this.  So John Wiley who used to run Google search.  He used to be the lead designer for Google search.  So Google search is like you know a billion users every day.  You leave that to go work on a piece of cardboard.  And then Alex Favre I don't know how to say his last name but he was the lead developer for Firefox or the lead designer for Firefox and was a designer on Chrome.  And he left to go work on the virtual reality team too.  And it's like all these people aren't going to leave their super awesome jobs where where they deal with millions of users every day to go work on like a weird side project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the and then Clay Baver or is who is VP for product management.  He was the guy in charge of Gmail Drive and Docs.  He said also oversaw Google Cardboard.  So he's going to be all all about VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then the and then one Diane Green is now getting the apps division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's a relative newcomer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's from VMware and she was going to run their enterprise.  They want to make like a new enterprise division or something where all their their cloud services end up under one thing.  Nobody really knows what's what's going on with that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to a recode Google suffering from FOMO the fear of missing Oculus.  I don't know if that's true.  I feel like Microsoft Google Facebook with Oculus all have been working on VR for some time.  I think Google Cardboard was a clever strategy because it popularized it.  But now Google has an official VP for virtual reality.  And I think that that you know the problem is Google shifts its gaze all the time.  And it's hard to say oh now they're really going to be in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's just the people work and they're really important though.  And I don't know fear of missing Oculus is interesting because I picture Oculus as a hardware company.  And this this Google division is going to be really focused on software.  I think we've there's been a Wall Street Journal report from a long time ago that said these these guys were all building an Android a version of Android for virtual reality.  So kind of the the virtual reality operating system where right now with an Oculus Rift and all that other stuff you kind of bounce in and out of you.  You have your mouse and keyboard and you start the Oculus app and then you put your headset on and then you you know you go into your virtual reality world.  But there's really no there's really nothing that lets you live in virtual reality or do productive stuff or anything like that.  You just bounce in and out from one video game to another really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have seen though. Sorry Ron. Go ahead finish. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To have Google do software would just be important I think because nobody's doing the software right now.  And I think that's what cardboard is. It's a developer kit to say this is what VR is like and this is the kind of stuff you can build get used to it and something better will come out later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and Bayvor has pointed his tweets about the CNN story about the surgeon using cardboard.  I don't know really. I mean he saved a baby's life.  But we've seen this actually in other we had a guy on the new screen savers who makes 3D models of infant hearts so that a doctor can practice the operation play with the operation study the heart before he goes in.  And this is kind of a similar application because they were able to look at the surgery ahead of time.  They could kind of understand where they were going and not be surprised.  He's also wearing Fitbit gear and it's obviously a very geeky doctor here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean you're look you're seeing the picture of the heart right now on a 2D screen.  That looks fine. I mean I'm no doctor but I don't see it being in 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well they're going to go in and under and around vessels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got to have a map of it in his mind. I mean this is this is common.  That's what this is. Yeah.  But can't you see that by rotating the flat image around. Does it need to be stereoscopic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well as I said yeah as I said you know we also learned of the making a 3D model is very helpful because they can.  Well I'm going to go in here and this do it like that. I think that actually be more useful than a Google Cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm terrible at spatial relations and pulling things out which is why I would never you never do an operation on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like this story as wonderful as it is is a is almost a plant from Google.  You know it's like look see cardboard. It's not it's not just a toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you a bit. I just put it in the chat on the rundown a better use.  I don't know if I mentioned this show a few weeks ago or not.  Lowe's the home improvement place as cardboard vending machines because you can see that if you're here's what your redesigned kitchen will look like and you really want to have a sense of it around.  That makes sense. Cardboard is about spaces.  And yeah that makes sense with spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really cool. So the the other thing Lowe's did actually is they have a project Tango app that does the same thing but with Tango because it has all of these lasers and measuring things on the front of it.  But it's augmented reality. So you see you see your kitchen and then you see the refrigerator in your kitchen at the right size and you know how much space it'll take up.  And I assume you can open the door and see you know how much space all that will take up.  And that's a really cool idea that's like actually useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's something interesting. Jason Clanthus our producer pointed out to me I'm from the Google developers blog spatial audio comes to the cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this part of the solution to the barf problem?  Maybe if it comes from someplace else where you expected it becomes very disorienting.  Right. Whereas if the audio gets tied to a space as you look around and it starts to match with your ear.  I think that's part of the problem the barf problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you does cardboard make you nauseous in the same way that an Oculus does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never had an Oculus on but cardboard I get a little wonky after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I don't. It's hard to get nauseous in cardboard because it has no head straps.  So I have to do this. Yeah that's to me. You get real tired of that after a few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah but that's the solution to me is it's not as immersive. I get wonky. You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. I don't get nauseous but I get I get for about five minutes afterwards I'm kind of trying to get my bearings.  Yeah. It's doing something to my. Yeah. Vertigo. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah. So the 3D audio thing Google bought a company called Thrive Audio a couple of months ago.  So I guess that's what this is. But again this is more kind of software platform building all this stuff.  Like if you want an SDK for virtual reality there's really not a lot of stuff out there.  And Google I'd imagine I saw the headline for this. I haven't really read it but I'd imagine it's a bunch of SDK stuff where it's like oh you want to do 3D spatial audio.  OK we'll handle all the hard stuff. Just you know stick the dot on wherever you want your audio to be.  Yeah. Yeah. And we'll kind of send that to you. So all of that all of that hard platform stuff I'd imagine Google's working toward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there is an app there's a demo app that you can sideload. Oh for cardboard. Yeah.  OK. So if you want to hear how it sounds you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the other fun thing for all this virtual reality and augmented reality stuff is Google's going to make processors for for all of this like smartphone processors.  A report from I'm going to guess the Wall Street Journal. Oh no the information. OK.  So it says that Google's they've gone to chip vendors with kind of these these designs for SOCs and they're like please build this.  It's for augmented reality because right now a smartphone chip is really not going to work out for VR or like you can get a gear VR and stick a Samsung smartphone in your little goggles.  Which I have done and have and I like. But it does not work.  It could work a lot better because smartphone processors are made for bursty applications where like you you want to take the processor and spike it and load your app really quickly and then come back down.  For battery savings where on VR you're you're going to want to run at full power for a much longer time without overheating and throttling and all this other heat and power related issues that you get on a smartphone.  So Google's kind of going to go to these chip companies and make something that's made to be a gaming slash VR slash 3D device that today's smartphone chips really aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you a related questions down on the rundown. Why is Amazon going into the chip making business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon I guess for their Kindle stuff I have no idea why why they want to make these things. I mean is servers I mean is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. That's what I'm wondering why that is there nothing Amazon can't do run newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was it was that they were selling stuff wasn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were they selling me it was like they were going to sell branded one I could tell you you know Apple has a huge benefit because it makes its own chips they can customize the chips to be very targeted to the use cases.  You know they're still using arm.  And in fact Apple was an early investor in arm.  But they by having chip designers and they have reputedly more than a thousand chip designers on staff at Apple.  They can make a chip that is purpose built for the hardware. Amazon has some great ambitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay so it says that they're designed there's still armchips media streaming devices connected home products data storage gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I don't know. They bought an Israeli company called Anna Pernod labs.  And Anna Pernod labs is making these so maybe it's just another business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. It's more internet of things stuff than than smartphone stuff. That's interesting.  So I mean they make the Alexa no the Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Echo is kind of the surprising kind of dark horse product for 2015 that really is going strong and might be even bigger in 2016.  They're making a handheld size echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. Maybe it's a smart way where they want to make maybe they want to make this all seems like really cheap stuff that they want to build.  So maybe it's like door locks and all of this weird internet of things things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It's very interesting. I love it that we have people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk dreaming big dreams.  Why not? You know and maybe some people at Google are doing that too.  The problem is you get to be a big company and the Elon Musk's of the world don't want to work there.  Right. They want to they just go start their own thing.  Must be challenging for a company like Google to keep innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well yeah that was that was part of the plan for alphabet where they can you know like they just got this will give you a company to join.  Yeah. And you can be a CEO now but you don't have to have you don't have to have investor call.  That's not going to fool anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to fool anybody.  Let's take a break and come back with more.  Ron Amadio is here from ours.  Technica he covers the Android beat and Google beat and we're talking about his roadmap for 2016 for Google.  Jeff Jarvis is also here professor of journalism and Google long time Google watcher.  According to Eric Schmidt, AI can help solve the world's hard problems.  So Eric Schmidt is all in on Skynet.  We'll talk about that just a little bit.  First I want to talk about standing up.  I used to do almost all my stuff stand up TV shows certainly and the radio shows as well because in research shows sitting is not good for you.  And obviously people have discovered that with a standing desk you go into any Silicon Valley enterprise now half the people are standing up but not always standing isn't always the right solution.  That's why I really like these Vera desks.  We have some here.  Vera desk lets you sit or stand as the occasion requires and what's really great about it is it will convert your existing desk to a standing desk without anybody's approval.  You don't need to get the boss to say you don't have to tear out your cubicle.  Your Vera desk sits right on your existing desk and you can have it raised or you can have it lowered.  You can stand or you can sit.  It comes fully assembled.  You just pull it out of the box.  Put it on your desk.  Place your monitors and your gear on it.  And you can there's no motor.  You can easily raise it because it's cleverly counter weighted.  So you just it's spring loaded.  So it makes it come up or down easily effortlessly.  Eleven different height settings and prices are very good because you're not buying a whole new desk just a Vera desk.  They start at one hundred seventy five bucks with free shipping in the continental U.S.  No wonder life hacker named Vera desk one of their five best standing desks.  It's also been featured on product hunt and gear patrol.  We got a Vera desk pro plus thirty six at the brick house and people that fight over who gets to use the Vera desk.  I just love this idea.  If you've been thinking about a standing desk but you're not sure you want to commit or maybe your place of work won't let you modify your desk, get a Vera desk.  It's affordable.  It's easy.  And when you purchase one, make sure you tell them you heard about it on Twitter.  That's V.A.R.I. D.E.S.K.  V.A.R.I.  D.E.S.K.  dot com V.A.R.I.  desk dot com.  Check it out.  It's awesome and simple.  We're talking about Google, Facebook, the cloud, all that stuff with Ron Amadio, Jeff Jarvis, Eric Schmidt says that artificial intelligence will let scientists solve some of the world's hard problems.  Certainly regular human intelligence hasn't helped like population growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Population growth is another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Climate change, human development and education.  A.I. will play this role.  Help scientists understand the links between cause and effect by sifting through vast amounts of information.  That makes sense, actually.  This is at a New York conference.  In the future, Eric says he would like to see Eric and not Eric.  Eric is the flesh and blood Schmidt.  Not Eric is the digital thing that helps me.  Eric's always been a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't heard some good Eric Schmidt quotes in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been a while.  We missed you, Eric.  Welcome back.  A.I. has yet to be proven to be able to do anything, but there's always hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I try not to read too much into anything Eric Schmidt says, but he's just Google.  Google does a ton of machine learning stuff.  I feel like in the past year maybe they've really come out hard with the machine learning like advert promotion, I guess you would say.  Where those are, oh yeah, this is machine learning and this and this.  So like Google Photos, you can search for stuff in your pictures, like not tags that you've done.  That actually works well.  Cars, right.  And their machine learning stuff, it works well enough that it will show you pictures of cars in San Francisco.  It's pretty amazing.  You can search for that and like it will nail it.  It's really good.  But I'm going to see you next week at Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait to.  Oh, you're going.  Is it already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not Eric.  Are you Eric or not Eric?  Is it Davos time once again?  Gosh, that comes around fast.  What do you think about Google's home automation ambitions?  Because they released the OnHub, which you didn't think much of.  Thank you for that review because I immediately canceled mine.  But a much better router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Smart move.  It still has not done.  You know, these it has a constant connection to Google and will update.  No, there's really been no significant updates yet.  Really.  It's just kind of an average Wi-Fi router, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But two hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So it has all these it has all these antennas in it that don't do a ton right now.  But someday.  They will turn them on.  Like I said, they just had their their Internet of Things conference this week  and they talked about so there's Brillo, which is an Android operating system  for the Internet of Things.  And it's it's kind of neat like you get a dashboard.  So all of these Internet of Things stuff right now are really insecure.  And this gives you a dashboard, just like on Google Play, where you can see all  your devices and push updates out to them.  And because because Google's doing the software, it will actually get updated.  We're like, I have some smartphone stuff.  I you know, I have a smart door lock.  I have no idea what software it runs.  The software has never been updated.  I'm sure there's security vulnerabilities in it.  But, you know, nobody's going to fix them because it's just some weird operating  system that the lock company made where this will kind of put security in the  forefront, which is important if any of this Internet of Things stuff is going  to actually do something.  And then they have Weave, which is like a security or a communications protocol,  which lets everything talk to everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's their equivalent of I was thinking of Threads.  Threads is the equivalent of Zigbee and Z-Wave.  Weave is at a higher level than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Weave is yeah, it kind of abstracts everything where you say you can tell a  door lock, lock the door rather than have to code whatever.  It's like a language to make everything right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's independent of protocol.  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Brillo, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was really interesting about this conference is somebody asked about Thread and  they were like, Thread is the Nest team.  Don't ask us about it.  That's not involved with us.  Oh, interesting.  And but in the branding, it's like there's Thread and Weave and you would think that  they're like connected somehow because of the branding so similar.  But no, it's just Nest doing their Nest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason I ask about that is that protocol 802.15.4 is built into the on hub  router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Which is also kind of Zigbee.  And so, you know, people say Google as a company and the way to think about it is  you look at that chart in the beginning of the Google tracker.  Those are the groups.  It's like the Google group is going to work together.  But Nest is in a separate thing in alphabet.  They're not going to work with Google.  That's never going to happen.  That level of organization does not exist.  That's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as you write, Thread originated Nest Lab, now lives as a product of Thread Group,  a not-for-profit organization with board members from Nest, Silicon Labs, NXP, Arm,  and Yale Residential Lock.  Yeah.  So you know what?  In other words, home automation is exactly where it was 10 years ago.  A mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pretty much.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so I think for that reason Thread is not going to do well.  Like Brillo and Weave will do well because it's Android and because it's Google.  And, you know, they'll have the scale.  Like this will be like Weave.  I said Thread was Google.  Weave is Google.  So Weave will be on like every Android phone and, you know, the scale will be there.  Where what is the Nest stuff got to do?  It's going to be on every Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's a Nest audio team.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're doing some kind of audio product.  So maybe Sonos.  I guess it's a Sonos clone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how about Glass?  Ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Glass.  So that is actually the second generation of Google Glass.  That's the enterprise edition that they are from the FCC that they are quietly shipping  to businesses.  Little eyepiece is longer and oh, there's a little light on the camera.  See the little black dot next to the camera lens.  So there's a little recording light so people can tell your spine on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is it so does it join up or is it just a little thing on your left ear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a Glasses part to it.  I would imagine.  But because this is the FCC, they don't care about that.  They don't care about that.  That doesn't put out radio waves.  That's just a holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's a hinge, which is really nice.  So it will finally fold up like a pair of Glasses instead of being this big all the  time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are you so, weren't you excited about Glass at one point, Jeff Jarvis?  I'm a schnuck.  I'm a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You fell for it.  Yeah, I spent a fortune.  I fell for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in a worse position than you.  I spent a fortune and I never got to wear it ever.  Yeah, that's right.  I bought it and Jason Howell has it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got one too.  I have my little Glass Block.  It's number 1499.  Oh, what happened to my Block?  I remember.  I have my Block somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where's my Block?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the Enterprise Edition, which has no software really.  So your company buys it and it's up to them to develop software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, even better.  Now it doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a third generation of Google Glass in the works called Project Aura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the one they're doing with Luxotica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the logo for that came out today on 9to5 Google.  It's in the dashboard thing.  It's a terrible logo.  But that is supposedly going to be the next consumer version where the Enterprise Edition  will never see the light of day for normal people, which is good because it doesn't look  very interesting.  The logo looks like it's out of focus.  Yeah, it's a very low resolution one apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So Squint, that's what it looks like.  It's still terrible.  This looks like somebody in high school designed it.  Yeah, somebody designed it in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Project Aura, not to be confused with Aura, the modular phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there's an Aura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the new version of Google Glass will...  What the heck do we know about this so far?  Geez, I forget.  It's got to come out to consumers sometime this year.  They had said, oh, it's under Tony Fidel with the Nest team.  Well, Tony Fidel is the founder and CEO of Nest right now.  I don't know if that means Google Glass is from Nest now.  The Google Glass team answers to him.  And it kind of got rebooted and nobody really knows what they're going to do with it next.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jessica Lessin writing the information says that he's the overseer and that he did experiment  with head-mounted designs at Apple way back when.  So this is a wearable with a screen and at least one without a screen.  There are three versions of the head-mounted device in development.  One, Targeted Enterprises, has a screen.  We saw that.  The other, which is targeted at sport users, doesn't have a screen, relies on audio.  So maybe it's just like the earbud.  A Motorola Hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is not a compelling device at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have one on my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never use it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it didn't work.  It didn't do anything different than a Bluetooth headphone was supposed to, but it never really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Also, I mean, what do you want to do with a little voice in your ear given current voice commands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't mind having Google Now in my ear if it really was like I could really have a relationship with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, well, not having a screen like Android Auto is a good, as weird as it sounds, it's a good idea of an interface without a screen  because the car regulations don't let you display text message text on a screen so it reads you everything.  And when someone sends you a funny YouTube video on Android Auto, you press it and it reads the message  and it goes HTTP colon slash slash.  It just reads the URL.  Too stupid.  It's horrible.  Too stupid.  Like you need a screen to communicate people.  And what is it going to say for your emoji?  We need Jarvis.  It's going to say smiling poop emoji at the end of the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but if it were Jarvis, it would be I could interact with it and it would be maybe Mark Zuckerberg will write this.  And I don't mind if it has your voice, Jeff.  That's fine.  I hope it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it'll be grumpy.  Jarvis will be grumpy.  Grumpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Haven't got it yet, but apparently the new Google Maps update will have a driving mode in a widget, a new drive widget that will just like the now card,  which knows where you go and gives you little hints saying, hey, you know, you better leave now.  This will now be part of Google Maps because it'll I wasn't talking.  Oh, my God.  My Google's woke up everywhere.  I'm talking to any of you and I'll add the driving mode widget.  You'll tap that and it'll say, oh, I know where you go.  And based on that, here's how long it's going to take you.  You should leave now.  That kind of thing.  Driving predictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this would be cool for this would be great for Android Auto, actually, where you kind of have that screen and it's there all the time doing something.  So you might as well make it do something useful.  Google now is very good about guessing where you want to drive next.  If you just open it up, it'll it'll say, oh, do you want to go like here or here or here?  And it would be able to tell pretty well after the first minute of you driving, probably like where you're headed.  So it could be interesting.  I think this doesn't work yet.  It was just well, Android police had some hack that you could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you can get the icon.  But it was like they found they found text in the in the APK that says it will do this.  But I don't think it works yet.  Actually, like it'll half work.  They need to turn on a bunch of server stuff to make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think first you need Google Maps version nine point nineteen.  So check that if you have that, then you can log out of Google Maps, tap the multitasking button on your phone, swipe away and just close it.  Google Maps reopen it and open this navigation panel.  You should see start driving.  But I don't know if it does anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Then what?  Like, what does it do?  I don't think I don't I think they don't have that information because it doesn't work yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Well, I'm going to do it anyway, because I am just that kind of guy.  So I've now closed it now reopen Google Maps.  I guess you have the right version, though.  Well, I don't know.  I was too much trouble to look.  Open this up and I don't have start driving, so I probably don't have the right version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also a they found text in there for a to do list, which sounds super awesome, where you could just be like, you know, go to go to this store, then go to this store and go.  Wouldn't that be good?  Yeah, because a lot of your to do lists are destinations map based anyway.  So that would be neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  They do that.  I have nine eighteen.  That's why.  So you need nine nineteen before you do this.  And even then, who knows what's going to happen?  Let's see.  New weather cards are better.  According to nine to five, Google and Google Now, they're colorful and they have little pictures of bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen the end of the old design?  What should we call it?  Design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's down.  It's now this is material or more than material.  Yeah, that's what I'm asking.  It's more than material.  It's yeah, it's a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot more colorful, which would be cute.  It hasn't happened on any of my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do I have a this day in Star Wars card?  I thought once the movie came out, I would stop getting all of this stuff, but I'm still like on the dark side.  I get a lightsaber for Gmail.  How do you turn all that crap off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it Google dot com slash Star Wars?  Yeah, I still have a tie fighter as my.  I got it. Yeah, Mike.  Yeah, I turned that on for about two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got super annoyed and was just like, I turned it on, got super annoyed and then forgot how to turn it off.  So thank you.  Please stop.  I'm not your father, Luke.  Oh, and I have to sit and watch an animation.  OK, you have joined the dark side.  I could change the side, but how do I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, change side and put it in the middle.  Put it in the put it just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Back to default.  I don't want either one of your stupid advertising experiments.  Your regular Google experience has now been restored.  Right. Thank you.  It's always I hope they got millions of dollars.  So I don't seem to have these new weather cards, but apparently this is being tested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think anybody does.  Like one one guy had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem with reading these.  These these these blogs, you get all these scoops and you want it, but you don't got it.  So I'm not going to mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Google now could definitely stand to get a bit of color.  It's always white, white square, black text and maybe a picture if it's news.  But yeah, colors, colors.  Good. Those look those are cool and colorful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, I just I feel like this is getting Google now is yet another missed opportunity, frankly.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Google now got got fought over internally by what the Android guys wanted it and the Google search team wanted it.  And because nobody at Google ever works together on anything, they fought over it.  And the people that lost like left and it's just a big it's just a big mess.  Google never works together for anything, which is why these products get successful and everybody fights over them.  And then they go nowhere.  So it's they're very disorganized.  I mean, the last thing the company did did together was Google+.  And the reason that happened is because Larry Page bribed everybody and was like, if this doesn't succeed, we're taking your bonus away.  And that takes that's what it takes to get Google to work as a singular company to to threaten everyone with by taking away their paycheck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, somebody at Google likes yoga because now when you search for yoga poses, you actually get a knowledge card that has a yoga has the yoga pose in it.  Here's downward facing dog.  Adho Mukha Svasana.  Savannah Sana.  Let's see.  Warrior one.  Let's let's see you do it.  Oh, I could do downward facing dog.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Rehabanash.  Rehabanash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dasha.  Dasha.  Says consult a doctor before beginning an exercise regime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's advice just customized for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sun Salutation.  No, no, no.  You know, somebody likes yoga at Google.  Probably that's that'll be one of the breakout sessions at Google.  Google I.O.  Let's see.  Anything else here?  I'm going through it.  Five.  You can now get an access five X for real cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there's the Google campus in my my roundup, which is very sad.  You know, they were they were going to do that weird spider webby.  Oh, they're not doing that.  They gave up.  This is all local politics for you, isn't it?  They they went to the city and they asked for the space that they needed  and they awarded most of it to LinkedIn.  So instead of building like however many because Mountain View was going to be  like totally owned by Google and the city and that like really scared the city.  So they gave they gave all the land Google wanted to LinkedIn.  And now they have like this crazy visionary campus with reconfigurable buildings  and it's like half indoor, half outdoor and nowhere to put it.  And yeah, I know where to put it now.  But yeah, it's like this weird glass like mesh roof.  It's New Jersey Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were people doing yoga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some people do skating skateboards.  This could have been remade Mountain View into a into a cloud kingdom.  Tear down the labs and put it up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There you go.  The problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that.  The problem with that is they already don't have office space.  So tearing off bring office space, you know, like offline for two,  three years is just not going to fly over there.  It does every time I've been it seems to be in a perpetual state of construction anyway.  Right.  So I don't know.  They just need more more space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this like the biodome?  Is it is it sealed and it's ecologically set, you know, recycling?  Or is it is it that are those panels open to the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's not sealed.  It's kind of it's like a hybrid indoor outdoor space a lot of times where it's you know,  the roof is there to keep the rain off of you and not too much else.  They can deploy little umbrellas to block the California.  Oh, I see the little umbrellas.  Yeah.  That's really silly.  And they're on the balcony.  There's people doing yoga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right there.  This could be the new San Diego Chargers Stadium.  Somebody gets a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were there were supposed to be robot cranes that could reconfigure the rooms to like different.  Oh, they do that in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have those those they have those modular apartment buildings and it comes and it moves you into a different place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole thing was going to be modular because they're like, oh, this search team has different office needs from the self-driving car team.  And yeah, they were going to be able to swap all that around.  There were going to be retail establishments where like, you know, regular people could walk around and and buy stuff.  Wow.  None of that's going to happen anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Project Loon still around?  The balloons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Loon is Loon is part of Google X, which is just X now.  Right.  Given the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it that you when you're talking about Calico, your your your byline is death still isn't cured.  So nice try, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a tough that's a tough mission.  It's going to be a hard one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google's anti-aging research company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Rough mission statement to just say we're going to we're going to stop people from dying and they have not yet.  So keep working.  Good luck.  It's all partnerships with Calico.  Like they partner with I think it was a bunch of different research universities and companies and everything else.  And that's it.  There's really nothing else to talk about there.  A lot of the the extra alphabet stuff is just so such deep R&D.  You're not going to see it for like five, ten more years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Project Wing drone deliveries.  Here's Makani, which are flying wind turbines.  This looks like a crash.  But in fact, that's not that is the prototype being lifted by a crane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a big that is a big plane wind turbine thing.  So there is there's a link to a video in there.  And when you hear this thing, like it makes these crazy rev noises and it's like nobody's going to want that flying over them.  Yeah.  To replace a windmill.  And like you have to when the weather gets bad, you have to like pull it, pull it down and park it so that I don't know.  So that doesn't get struck by lightning and crash.  I mean, look how big that thing is.  You know, if it if it decides to not be aerodynamic anymore and slam into the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though.  I don't understand.  It's flying, but it's getting wind power.  Is it is there a wire attached to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So so the idea is you take a wind turbine and you stick it really, really high up in the sky where there's more the air is faster.  It's useful in more places because like wind turbines have to have a certain amount of wind.  So wind turbines tend to be in big empty fields where this if you just go up higher, the wind stronger and you can generate power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all blue sky research.  I'm glad they're doing it.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, but they sound horrible.  Yeah, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is something dystopian about a thousand of those above you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the other thing is density.  So as as tall as the wire is, that's also how far apart they have to be.  So they won't collide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so this one, as neat as a lot of the Google R&D projects are, this one has a lot of issues that is just all kinds of wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does it does it gain wind power on the on the when it descends or how is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a it's a kind of it's like a kite.  It is a kite with wind turbines attached, so it doesn't need it's not how to go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The propellers don't propel it.  The propellers are the wind turbine.  Got it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just catching the wind, man.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is pretty wonderfully.  It's brilliant.  It's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just great.  You know, I just you need people to do stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the Da Vinci kind of series that's on TV?  I didn't I didn't discover it until this week.  There's a there's a Da Vinci's Ghosts.  I think it's called.  It's actually pretty fun, but it feels like, you know, Da Vinci has Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What Da Vinci's Ghosts Da Vinci's Ghosts.  Is that the name of it?  Is that the name of it?  Toby Lester.  Yeah.  Tells the story of the world's most iconic image of a Truvian man.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, wait, that's a book.  It's a book.  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody made a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show out of it.  Oh, yeah, it's NPR.  Yeah.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a TV show.  OK, never mind.  I don't I can't find it.  Hold on.  Genius obsession.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I started this and I can't I can't help you.  OK, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There is a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just give me one second.  It's Da Vinci's Demons.  Da Vinci's Demons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, let's not.  It is Da Vinci's Demons.  It is Da Vinci's Demons.  Da Vinci's Demons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Da Vinci's Demons.  Not as good as stars.  It's a star show.  It's not.  I just watched the first episode because it was free on Google Play.  I'll have to check it out.  Science and sex and the same thing.  You know, it's perfect for our audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the untold story of Leonardo da Vinci?  Oh, so it's like a dramatization of his life.  Yes.  Oh, that sounds good.  Yeah, it is.  It's fun.  I'll watch that.  So far.  Yeah.  Apparently, Facebook mentions can now be run on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those of us who are verified Facebook personalities can now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I can do mentions now.  No, I know you can.  I'm just saying to the rest of the audience.  Oh, for the rest of you.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you were neener and neener and neener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was being an arsehole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Ricky Gervais kind of stopped doing it now, so...  Facebook mentions.  I'm just going to see if I can download this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have other people doing it now.  So, Cenk Uygur from Young Turks, he just turned it on the other day and he's in the hotel  room screaming about how one soap bar isn't enough.  I need one soap bar for the tub, but I need one soap bar for the sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, please.  That's the last thing I want to see.  Oh, I actually kind of enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  I thought I downloaded it.  Now, come on.  It's not under M for mentions.  No, you have to look for Facebook mentions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not under F for Facebook either.  Well, I just found it.  I'm downloading it right now.  So I can...  I downloaded it already.  I can't find it.  A live stream.  Oh, you can't find it on your phone.  Oh.  Google's self-driving cars would have caused 10 accidents...  If...  If the drivers hadn't grabbed the wheel.  So, I'm kind of glad they still have a wheel.  Google always said, oh, those 17 reported accidents, those were always caused by humans.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those were, those were caused by humans.  But there were 10 near misses that were stopped by humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Test drivers disengaged the self-driving system on 69 occasions between September 2014 and November 2015.  But according to its own...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of that is them being overly cautious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to Google's simulations, the self-driving car would have made contact with an object on 13 occasions out of the 69.  On 10 of the 13 simulated contacts.  In other words, driving somebody over or something.  The system would have been at fault.  And two of the 10 would have been with traffic cones.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had to hand over their data whenever an override came.  Right.  Which is fascinating.  That's one way to test, you know, when did you have to override?  Right.  Yeah, the...  I thought the biggest news out of CES was that they were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was it?  Yahoo Auto said that Google and Ford were going to announce a self-driving...  Right.  Didn't happen.  ...partnership.  Yeah.  And then it didn't happen.  Yeah.  But just that they...  Like, we don't know if it just totally doesn't exist or if they just decided not to announce it.  Like, it's hard to believe that they got the report totally, totally wrong.  But just the idea that they were going to make a joint venture with Ford that kept Ford, like, legally safe from all of the self-driving cars legal issues...  Ah, interesting.  ...was really cool.  Like, that sounded like an actual solution that they could get some cars on to adopt.  Yeah.  Because Google needs somebody to build these cars.  And to kind of have a path to consumerization is...  Yeah.  ...to kind of have a path to consumerization is really neat.  But I don't know what Ford's deal was.  I don't know why it just never happened or...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a bummer.  It was really exciting to have the car stuff take a step forward.  Because all of this...  As much as the weird...  You know, we talk about silly gadgets and all this other stuff, but the self-driving car stuff can, like, actually save lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's going to happen.  I really think it's going to happen.  It's really important, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's something that I hope doesn't happen in the state of Kentucky.  A lawmaker has proposed a bill that would ban you from posting a video of a horrible accident for an hour after it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the stupidest thing on earth.  Controlling information doesn't work, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It comes from state representative, John Bam Carney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  State representatives are just...  That's why...  I'm starting to get in trouble now because of your...  That's why we want states' rights so people like that can run the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bam Carney would impose a fine of $20 to $100 if you publish a video of any accident or any information identifying the victims of Sarah's physical injury, unless you're the victim.  In which case, it's okay.  He says, it's purely my intent to get a discussion going out there asking people to be more respectful about what they put on social media.  What happens in Kentucky stays in Kentucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think legislating Twitter is ever going to work.  Like, good luck.  You've got to pay somebody to look at all of that and Google where they live and send them a ticket.  Good luck with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't.  That's prior restraint.  There's a whole bunch of problems with that.  Good article, I thought, from Stephen Levy, once again, writing for Medium, his interview with Bill Ford at CES.  In which Bill Ford effectively says, hey, we're pivoting.  The Ford Motor Company, which by the way was the most successful car company of 2015 in the year, in which all the car companies did very, very well.  Admitting that it's not so much about cars anymore.  Ford is, he says, Stephen asks, Bill, can I call you Bill?  Is Ford attempting the biggest pivot of all time?  And Bill Ford says, no question.  No question.  So Ford did announce, while they didn't announce the Google partnership, they did announce, for instance, a program to place sensors in motorcycles to map roads in West Africa to improve the routing of health care services.  They may in fact get in the Uber and Lyft business.  They have a lot of interesting things.  You know, they're kind of recognizing that.  So after the show last week?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when you mentioned Ford?  Yeah.  So, Ron, I'm on this constant question to see if I can't get the car I want.  Ron can help you do it.  Ron can help you.  So I went and looked at the Lincoln MKC.  Ooh, nice. Nice car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And?  I don't know.  Are you ready for a Lincoln?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't bought a, am I old enough? Yeah.  I haven't bought a domestic car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Since, yeah, thanks a lot, since 1973.  It was the last time I bought a US car.  I was looking at the new Lincoln Continental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the Continental, I think it has the 2016 Lincoln Continental.  It's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so Ron, they all have SYNC 3, the Ford SYNC 3, and SYNC 3 works with...  SYNC 3 will do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, we got an email from one of our listeners who has, I think, an Escape, and he will,  he got an email from Ford, he's going to get an upgrade in March to support Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I've been, I'm actually working on an article that kind of compares infotainment  systems from all the different car vendors I've had.  I've had a stream of vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, fun for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To make this happen, yeah.  And the level of just complete misunderstanding or incompetence from these car companies when  it comes to software, it's so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They shouldn't be writing their own software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just had a Chevy Impala, and the software on it looked like a Chinese GPS from eBay  from like 1999.  I'm talking like, the phone icon is like a fully rendered 3D phone with like a chrome  ring around the square, and it looks like, it just all looks, it looks so bad, and it  works horribly, and nothing like scrolls smoothly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's an argument, though, for Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These car companies, like, you're not a software company.  Don't make software.  Right, don't do it.  Google and Android Auto.  So Ron, is it worth it to try to get Android Auto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh?  Hell yes.  Is it worth it?  Oh, yeah, anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android Auto, CarPlay, anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, and I think in almost every case, if you get Android Auto, you'll get CarPlay.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  No?  No, it is separate.  Car companies will support one and not the other.  It's all over the place right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But some cars do both, right?  Yes.  Because I'm not going to buy a car that will not do both, because I use different phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and some car companies have one, and have promised to ship a software upgrade to  update the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ford said it would do both, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  So my...  The favorite one I've run into so far is Honda, which bases their car infotainment system  on Android 4.0 from 2011.  And it has the stock Android browser in it, which you can just use.  So, you know, Chrome gets a security update every couple months, or every month.  And imagine using a browser on the internet from 2011, and the security issues that this  thing has, that they just sell.  Like, it's 2016, and they sell software from 2011 in these cars.  The car companies, they are not equipped to be hardware companies in any fashion.  And Ford's just as bad.  I had a Ford Escape.  The whole system looks like it's a settings page from, like, it's just white with blue  icons, and nothing else.  And it's slow, and weird, and ugly.  So what are you going to recommend, Ron?  Get something with Android Auto.  I mean, it's all...  It's all...  They're all bad.  And even if you try to, like, really use this stuff, the mapping situation, there are no  good map vendors out there.  I mean, they're the two best...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't find it right now.  There's a VW executive, a company we really want to trust right now, went on saying that,  oh, you know, these Silicon Valley companies don't know how to do this.  They can't do mapping and all this as well as we can.  And that's why we're not going to use Android Auto and stuff.  We're going to not push it in every car.  No, your systems suck.  Listen to Ron, people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the worst is the voice commands, where, like, on a phone, you can say navigate to,  you know, you can say navigate to Best Buy on your phone.  And then on these car systems, you say navigate to Best Buy and nothing happens.  And then it will say navigate, and then you have to tell it the city, and then you have  to tell it you want a point of interest first, then you tell it the city, then you tell it  the name of the point of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's a reason for that, Ron.  They're not online.  They're doing that all with their internal computer, whereas your phone is smart enough  to be sending your voice up to the server, and it can then, you know, do a lot better  job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some of them tether to your phone and work online.  The worst is Chevy, which has a 4G modem in the car.  So the car is a big hotspot with AT&T.  So your car has a monthly bill to get data access.  And this is the kind of misunderstanding that car companies have, where they say, we need  to get internet in the car.  So let's call AT&T.  And it's like, nobody wants that.  Just tether to my phone.  Right.  I already have internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't need to.  Yeah, my Audi has 3G on T-Mobile, and they're going to have LTE next year.  And you're right.  It should all be through the phone, frankly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to keep asking Ron, what's the best path to put in?  Which manufacturer has the best structure to use Android Auto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're, I mean, they're all about, if you can find something that supports Android Auto,  they're all about the same because the car system turns off and Android Auto just kind  of takes over.  But I've seen, I know Honda will do it, and that's pretty good.  Honda's a good choice.  That's a nice car.  It's a relatively nice Honda with all of this.  They have some cool like automated driving stuff where it'll do radar guided cruise control  and kind of stay within the painted lines as you drive along.  That's probably been the best one I've seen so far.  As terrifyingly insecure as the operating system is, it seems to be the least awful.  But they're all, it's just all bad right now.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's why I feel like car play and Android Auto are really the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And even then you have to be careful about the hardware because the Chevy that I looked  at had a resistive touchscreen.  Oh, yuck.  I'm talking about you could go to the settings and go to a line touchscreen and they put  the little Xs on the screen and you have to poke in each corner and in the center.  Why?  Because all of the gear they use is from like 2011 because car companies, they don't understand  technology.  They move at a snail's pace.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look at the, so this is from Android's Android Auto website.  I mean, these are the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but it's BS.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are the badges that they say will be using Android Auto and it's pretty much everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the worst too is you go into an Audi.  I was thinking about an Audi.  Audis are very nice.  I went into three dealers and I say Android Auto and they'll say Android Audio.  Oh, Lord.  When are you getting it?  They don't know anything.  I went online to Twitter and said, what's the deal?  And they gave me a bad answer.  I tried to go to the PR department of the company and never got an answer.  It's like they don't really know.  These dealers are all idiots about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that attitude extends all the way up to the top of the company and the people  making this software.  It's just nobody there understands technology from top to bottom.  What about the Tesla media experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think that'd be pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd try to Tesla too.  Is it better?  And no, Tesla is at least interesting.  Tesla is at least interesting because it's a big giant television.  Yes, a 17 inch screen.  But no, it's still this software.  I say it feels like ATM software.  Yeah, that's about right.  Where like it is a computer, but it was never designed to make anybody happy or look nice or just work well.  It's just not good.  It's still not from a software company that makes and when you look at any computer, there is a monopoly on computer interfaces.  Well, not a monopoly, but there's three companies you can buy a computer interface from.  It's Apple, Google, Microsoft, and that's it.  Nobody else really makes software like operating systems.  You know, if you want a laptop or phone or a tablet or it's only those three companies.  I don't want the Ubuntu car.  Ubuntu car.  Good software.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of these cars do run Linux.  They're running QNX.  Yeah, they run QNX, Linux, Android.  A lot of cars actually run Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want Android 4.0 in my car.  I'm sorry.  I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, one of the things in my article is Google is going to make a real version of Android  for cars where like it's the operating system that runs in the car hardware as opposed to  Android Auto, which is just an application that takes over the screen.  This is actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if, okay, I got a solution for you.  What if you got a car that didn't have anything and you put in a aftermarket Android Auto  solution?  Have you tried those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, like a head...  Like Pioneer's head unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're really expensive and they cluj up the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're resistive touch screens again most of the time.  But you're talking about a thousand bucks for that radio.  If your car can even support that, I mean half the time step one is get a hacksaw and  cut your radio out of the car.  But that's why I want to see this Google car operating system.  It's in the Google Play documents.  Car is an operating system form factor next to TV, watch, phone and tablet.  So there are actually rules for device manufacturers on how to build a car with Android built into it.  Okay, here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what you do.  This is the Pioneer AVIC 8100NEX.  It is a capacitive touch screen.  It does Android Auto and CarPlay.  It's only $1,200.  I know, amazing, isn't it?  But you might be able to, it's seven inches, you might be able to get a deal on a car without any kind of head unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And see, this is another company that does not understand technology because what kind of processors in that?  Probably not enough.  No, you won't even find that on the Amazon page.  They don't think it's important.  They don't think it's important because they don't know what any of those numbers mean.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean?  It's four volts, 800 by 480 display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, no processor.  Is it a Snapdragon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't it the case with Android Auto that the processor is really the phone more than the unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're still buying a car head unit that runs some kind of operating system.  It has Pioneer software.  It has some kind of, yes, some kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at this. This is awesome.  It has a remote control you could put right on the dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember that.  That will really.  That thing still feels like it's from the 90s.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not what you want in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you don't have to lean forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just tape that to the steering wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it. That's the other bummer with that.  That's not going to integrate with your car.  Android Auto and CarPlay and all that stuff, the steering wheel buttons will work.  Yeah.  And there's usually a microphone.  So what should Jeff do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He should just give up and get a car next year.  So it sounds like it's a Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get a Ford or a Honda. Get something with a car.  Ford with SYNC 3.  If you follow the smartphone trajectory, I feel like we're in the Windows mobile phase right now,  where just every piece of software you buy is going to suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've kept my last car for 11 years.  And so I don't know if I'm going to keep this one for 11 years.  By the way, that is the average in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The average age of a car on the road in the United States is 11 years.  You're right in that.  It's about 500,000 miles.  But that's the problem is there's the long design cycle, three to five years of a car,  and then people keep it for 10 years.  Yes.  No technology.  They should be upgradable idiots.  You don't use any personal computer or consumer electronic technology that's 15 years old today.  And they would make such money for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would swap out the consumer electronic experience in the car.  Every year, just like I do phones, right?  They'd make a fortune from an aftermarket within their own companies.  I'm going to get the Chevy Bolt.  That looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, if you know who Cinnamon Toast can, Cutie Pie Marzia, you know who they are, don't you, Chris?  Dodger, Emma Blackery, Jack Septic Eye, Jelly, Quibble Cop, and Mark Plyar, Marky Plyar R.  You're going to be very excited about this announcement.  PewDiePie is starting his own video network featuring those and other great YouTube stars.

Transcript:  PewDiePie.  It won't be long before he'll be running for president.  He's got 41 million passionate subscribers, according to The Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to The Verge on YouTube.  And Revel Mode is going to be backed by Maker Studios, which is in turn backed by Disney.  PewDiePie, of course, the number one star on YouTube right now,  reputedly makes $7 million a year off of his 41 million subscribers.  And now he's going to make even more with the PewDiePie network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he has lasted longer than Peach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Peach is over.  PewDiePie lives.  When you put Cinnamon Toast Ken together with Jack Septic Eye and the rest, you get 100 million subscribers.  That's Seinfeld numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing makes me feel older or more out of touch than any of that PewDiePie stuff.  I just have no idea.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Craig Newmark posted on Facebook asking for permission to buy a pirate ship.  He says, honey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honey?  There's a story of a pirate ship for sale on Craigslist, and there is Craig Newmark just saying honey, question mark?  Honey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The better visual guy can I buy it?  For a small fee relative to the local Bay Area home prices, you can buy a ship equipped with a player piano and a saloon,  a three inch thick huge dining table made of rich mahogany, three bedrooms, a galley, and a full bar, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you could...  Well, listen, considering Bay Area real estate, that's not a bad deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  How much is it?  Wait a minute.  Now, then I have switched to a man shot to death in a truck.  I don't know how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  USA Today is just the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just completely lost this story.  Okay.  How much is it?  It's a Sultana that's an authentic replica of a brigantine that sailed in the 1700s.  Doesn't say how much he wants for it.  Make an offer?  Oh, $50,000 is nothing.  That's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is I think you have to talk pirate all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arrrr!  Wait a minute.  Lisa?  Wait a minute.  We've been looking for a new studio space.  This is it.  I always wanted a pirate radio.  This is it.  It is.  We can own it outright and sail it off.  Honey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Live off the coast of San Francisco.  Pirate twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome.  He actually was hosting kids' birthday parties and private parties on it.  But I guess he's...  It's been in the Brisbane Marina for 20 years.  It needs work, says Channel 5 News, but the bones are good.  Oh man.  It would be such a perfect podcast paradise as we sail the seven seas in search of Google  News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pirate radio.  What kind of internet would you get on that thing?  East satellite.  17th century internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo got great internet on his cruise ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's really true.  The internet was phenomenal on Royal Caribbean.  And thank you, Chris Hughes, for buying The New Republic, trashing The New Republic,  and then saying, I'm tired of The New Republic and selling it.  Yep.  What are you going to do?  How old is Chris Hughes?  He looks like he's 14.  32, I think.  He's so young.  He was, of course, one of the Facebook billionaires.  And in 2012, he bought what was one of the great progressive magazines...  It was hit a lot downhill itself.  Had it?  Well, it was owned for a long time by a real estate developer who I thought was quite good.  Anyway, he says, after investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I've  come to the conclusion it's time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic.  Of course, he decided to make changes in the entire staff left when he said we're going  to make it a...  What did he say?  A digitally facing...  We covered it when he had a digitally facing network.  Crazy.  Street View.  Here's a fun one.  The best things come in small Street View packages.  They're doing a Street View of Das Miniature Wunderland on Google Maps.  It's the world's largest model railway.  And Google made a little promo video for how they're going to do it on Google Maps.  It's kind of cute.  They're zooming into this.  Where is this?  Obviously, it's in Germany, right?  Have you seen it?  Yes.  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got better things to do when I'm in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's... where is it?  It's Hamburg.  I'm sorry, Hamburg.  Hamburg.  So they made a little Miniature Street View car.  That's kind of cool.  It's riding through the quaint streets of the miniature railroad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did they really get a camera that tiny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess they did.  How can I search for this?  Let me go to maps.google.com.  And is it Miniature Wunderland?  Oh, there's a link.  Of course there is.  There it is.  That's really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Complete waste of brilliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an ad.  It got us talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  I'm sure the next time I'm in Hamburg, I'll go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you will in your laterhosen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the laterhosen.  I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrong half of Germany, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am ready.  All right, ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Germany the one that super hates Street View and Vans?  They should blur all those.  They're right.  That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to be blurring the little toy buildings.  All right, we're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

It's free to download.  It's free to download.  You can put it on USB key and boot into the x86 version of it.  I have another one too I'll do in a bit.  But Jeff, you want to do number then we'll give Ron a chance to pick some.  I'll do two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But actually first you're going to have to turn off the sound for a moment.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn it back on.  Oh, he's blowing as he's sneezing.  Yeah, sorry.  He got, you probably had one of those black pepper naturebox snacks.  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm allergic to the hat.  It does.  I just want to mention one thing, which is Udacity is now offering a job guarantee for  four of their, of their nano degree courses, nano degree plus.  And within six months, if you don't have a job in the area you're trained to do, you'll  get all your tuition back.  Oh, that is awesome.  Isn't that Sebastian Prudn?  That is so cool.  The founder of Udacity.  The son Jake is busy working for Hillary Clinton right now, but otherwise he's really Jake's  working for the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire.  You bet.  Good for Jake.  But otherwise he's taking the nano degree and it looks like a good program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he was a programmer in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been doing this way.  He got to a certified level.  Yeah.  That area.  What is he learning?  He's doing the iOS, I think.  He's done and done before, but he has just, you know, it's certified.  Formalizes it.  No, I think that's really smart.  Good for him.  You have a portfolio.  The other thing worth mentioning just for one second here is the other news besides  new well, you have the New Republic being sold if he's damn lucky.  You have the Philadelphia Inquirer was given to a foundation.  Isn't that a non-profit?  Yep.  They have the HuffPost gave up HuffPost Live, which was their effort to be you and do eight  hours a day.  They gave that up?  It's over.  They're just going to do other kinds of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not good for us because that means people will say, oh, you see, there's no live is  there's no hope in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they put my column in the Observer, which was just out today, argues that what they  did was they tried to take us off.  It's very nice.  They tried to argue.  They tried to mimic TV news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they did.  They really did the wrong thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the fourth in this in this chain of sorrows is that just this afternoon, Al  Jazeera America, not that you're going to notice, is folding.  What?  Yep.  Because, well, and the idiocy, they spent five hundred million dollars to buy Al Gore's  current TV.  Current TV was never figured out.  There was no need to have a TV channel for him.  There was no need for Al Jazeera to have a TV channel.  They should have done it digitally.  Nobody watched it.  They hired dull old American TV people to make a dull old American TV channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But meanwhile, and here's the they could have given me a tenth of that amount.  I would show them how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and me.  And who care?  Who needs a TV?  Who needs Channel 876?  It's not right.  Ridiculous.  However, under the radar, of course, along came AJ+.  I wrote a long time ago that that video on mobile was going to have to be a silent movie  because you weren't going to put in your headset or play it, I hope, out loud.  But I didn't see what was coming, which was Facebook doing the autoplay with sound down  and AJ+.  Smart.  The digital arm of Al Jazeera Plus was brilliant.  Yep.  And still using video.  I see it all the time on my face.  Highly informative.  And so here's the number.  Finally, finally, here's the number of the week.  AJ plus had 2.2 billion Facebook video views last year.  Wow.  So in the midst of the failure of Al Jazeera America, there is this little rump organization  had this nice success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do they do what do they do?  Captions?  How do they handle the fact that you don't have audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to their Facebook page and pick one, you'll just see that they tell the story  in captions or headlines or whatever you want to call them.  Smart.  Smart movies.  You can still turn the sound on, but I never turn the sound on.  You don't need to.  I often watch them because you don't need to.  Yeah.  There's no, the real sound doesn't really add anything.  Brilliant.  You can hear the crowd screaming.  I can figure that out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really, they saw it right away.  Here's an example.  And yeah, they just, so it's almost like infographics on top of video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just kind of brilliant.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because of Facebook's autoplay, they got a play on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, those autoplay numbers are rough.  So you just watch two videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, probably I also watch this one and this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they just, they pump that number up as artificially as possible.  It's really transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is too bad because then somebody like this who probably does get some, a lot of views,  a lot of views.  They're going to be judged to be.  Not really counted.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they said in the article, it said half of them were 30 second views.  Right.  So about half of them are fake-ish.  Right.  30 seconds is maybe a little long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'll take 1.1 billion real ones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  That's it.  I'm actually going to have to follow this page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are there ads?  Do they get money for that?  I mean.  No, because they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other thing about it.  It's funded by the, was it the government of gutter or?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which one?  But I mean, Facebook's video platform.  I never really see ads on those video things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think with a new Facebook deal, you can sell ads.  There's a split, not as good a split as Google has, but you can put ads on.  But that'll have an impact on that.  Well, the next thing, so I haven't seen advertisers doing this.  I've seen other news outlets copy in AJ Plus and learning from that.  What you haven't seen is advertisers learning from that and giving you a message without the need for sound.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  Rana Monaco, what do you got for us?  A little bit of a pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to go with the TV show.  I can do that, right?  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called The Expanse.  It's on sci-fi or the internet, which is cool.  You can just click episodes there and watch them all online, which is really neat.  So The Expanse is a new sci-fi series.  It's kind of, if you've liked Battlestar Galactica and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And who didn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like you're in the future.  Everybody's in outer space.  There's like three kind of political groups that you've been introduced to so far.  There's Earth and the Belters, which live in the asteroid belt, and people that live on Mars.  And it's a really kind of intriguing look at what near space travel looks like for humans so far.  It's based on a book series, so there's all sorts of, if you've read the books, which I haven't,  there's all sorts of stories coming up that some people know about and some don't.  And more factions to introduce us to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm wondering if I should read the book first.  Steve Gibson, who loves the books, has been very happy with the show.  He says it's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's only about six episodes so far, but it's very interesting so far just because the Belters have,  the people that live in the asteroid belt, the gravity there is so low that they can't come back to Earth.  So they're kind of stuck there.  They get treated like slaves sometimes and abused by the Earth government.  The Martians are this kind of really hardcore, like military kind of people so far that are really gung-ho  about terraforming Mars into a livable atmosphere.  Like right now, everybody over there lives in a bubble and life is tough.  And it's really intriguing and fun so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The expanse, and apparently they have just been green-lighted for a second season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, fantastic. Good. That was my other worry as in a Firefly fan and everything else.  I had been starting to watch this and I'm like, oh god, this is going to be canceled soon, isn't it?  But that's awesome. So you got at least two seasons of good TV to watch, hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something's happened over there at Sci-Fi. They've really upped their game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was shocked that this was on there. It was like super good because I had heard about it.  I'm like, oh, this is going to be on HBO or something.  It's pretty high budget. The special effects are decent and there's really cool technology.  Everybody has glass cell phone and the pictures pop off of the screen a little bit.  And everybody shares stuff just by going like that. It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can imagine that 10 years, five years from now, really. That's not so distant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I always love media like that, like Minority Report and all that stuff.  They kind of envisions futuristic computer interfaces.  It's always a really fun kind of background piece to the Sci-Fi stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I'm with you. Very good. Ron is, of course, the guy to follow at Ars Technica.  Really, we love Ars Technica in general, but his coverage...  And we love Ron.  And we love Ron. And his coverage of Android is just fantastic and of Google to read his new article,  the Google Playbook for 2016 at ArsTechnica.com.  Follow him on the Twitter. What is your Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At Ronam Audio.  That's easy. R-O-N-A-M-A-D-E-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice.  Yeah, just Google me. You'll find all sorts of stuff.  Next up, like I said, next up I'm doing car stuff and it's all super terrible, which is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the one I want to read.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Like Jeff, I'm going to be in the market soon. We're trying to figure out how...  What are you thinking there?  You know, the Ford actually announcement got me intrigued.  I love my Mustang and they have some nice stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe go and take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm on the list for a Tesla X.  Yeah.  I'm thinking maybe that's a lot of money for...  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe not a great car.  For driving three blocks from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the other thing. I could really get a Trek. It would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you have your old...  I have my tricycle, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Segways.  Segways. Got those two. And I might get the new Segway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When was the last time you used a Segway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's rainy around here. We don't ride them much.  I love the Segway. I really do.  But it's not something you spend a lot of time on, unless the weather's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the studio's graveyard of dead dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want to see my graveyard of dead dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You must have gotten a hoverboard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we got a hoverboard. The kid rides that around.  Has it caught fire yet?  No. Thank God, no.  But I admit we unplug it every time we're not home.  Oh, good.  We do not want it to overheat while we're not around.  Tesla Mark II, though, is going to be...  Mark III, rather, is going to be the inexpensive one, but that won't be in time, I think.  I don't know.  But it'll be like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it the Lone Ranger in silver? You can whistle it, it'll come to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, from anywhere, all around the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys ridden in a Tesla?  I have one driving around New York City, like the automated driving thing.  It's super terrifying.  I haven't done that, no.  It's so much fun. It's so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a soft spot for Ford still, after many years of sponsorship of the network.  Yeah, maybe they'll come back.  Or maybe a Lincoln.  A Lincoln is a Ford.  With a higher price tag.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did you find out with the Ford about CarPlay and Android Auto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did you...  Well, they said it'll have a sync three, and I said it's just like the Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said, yeah, it's my Ford, it's my Lincoln.  Right.  Yeah.  So it's that.  I was looking at the Audi Q3.  I want the smaller, higher up.  I was looking at the...  Lexus NX, which is their small one.  I can't afford the bigger one, but it's a smaller one.  And then I said, you inspired me last week to go take a look, and it's the equivalent car.  So I don't know.  I could go all electric with the Ford.  I could do a C-Max.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Ford's actually, they said they were licensing or they were going to be a platform and send, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Ford MyLink.  They were going to be sending it to the Ford.  MyLink is like their app platform where you can start Pandora and it will show up on their crappy little car computer.  Don't like that.  And yeah, they want to license that like the other car companies.  Like Ford, you're not going to be an app platform, man.  Get out.  Well, they really think they see themselves that way.  That was one of the reasons they were in advertisers because they really saw themselves as a consumer electronics company as much as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They see themselves as a consumer electronics company.  They sound like the typical company that is about to be disrupted and is in total denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have the skill for it.  Okay, okay.  Fair enough.  But we kick them and beat them up for not doing anything.  When they do something, we kick them and beat them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing about Ford, and I haven't used it, but when they advertised on Twitter, they were trying.  Right.  And I give them that.  The problem is what you say is what you say is what you say is what you say.  The entire industry is built for this long cycle of development, long cycle of ownership and no idea of trade.  You trade whole cars.  You don't trade parts.  That cars should be upgradeable.  Wouldn't that be cool?  At least Tesla does that.  At least Tesla makes things.  I don't mean just software upgradeable.  I mean hardware upgradeable.  Right.  And it's a business model.  And it means you've got to build things to specs and sizes that have to last for a long time.  And you've got to have a lot of people that are going to be like, oh, this is a good car.  It means you've got to build things to specs and sizes that have to last.  And you've got to be backward compatible.  And that gives them a headache.  But it would make a huge difference in the industry.  I suspect what they want is they don't want you to upgrade your car.  They want you to trade in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  A whole new one.  Well, they know that that model is dying.  Yeah, it is.  Personal ownership of cars is going to go away.  Hey, we got to run.  You guys have been here long enough.  We've got another show to do.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  Thank you, Ron Amadio.  Thank you all for being here.
