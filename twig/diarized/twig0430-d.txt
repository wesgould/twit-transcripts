Transcript:  What a great I've never been there. I've been dying to go to the free years. I'm only gonna be there for two days. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll have fun. Yeah  Also here journalist par excellence Stacey Higginbotham  She was she's been around she was a gig home. I didn't realize you worked for Time Warner time Inc  I mean fortune. Oh fortune. That's right. Yeah, you were there for a cup of coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A whole year actually really that's like that's like a cup and a half. It seemed like it went fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It did she was very smart. In fact, I saw you acknowledge that the other day you did the right thing  You started your own business Stacey on IOT. It's a newsletter. It's a podcast with Kevin Toffle and it's going great guns, right?  It is it's actually doing really well. You got this. I saw you on tech meme. You got the scoop on  ADT and ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually law 360 was reporting from the courtroom, so I just brought that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the put that's that's that's the trick, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know but like you gotta know where to look physically there as a journalist  I'm like I gotta give credit to the people who actually went and did the the footwork. Absolutely. What does you take on that? You know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have talked to some people who say this isn't a surprise ADT is very aggressive about ADT is super aggressive. They have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have done some really shady things both they an alarm if you look at some of their lawsuits back and forth between each other  You'll see some pretty crazy tactics

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They claim the ring they blocked and a judge agreed by the way judge gave him a temporary adjunction against rings new security  System which they haven't they've announced but haven't shipped and I think may miss Christmas because of this  Probably yes claiming it violates  their patents or property rights  Yes, we should mention ring is a sponsor. I just want to say that real quickly rings a sponsor of the show  Not that that changes anything. It doesn't make me more in favor of them or not. I  Don't really know the facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So ring so I don't know how much I don't know how many of the facts you actually want to know  So that's probably because you know at all because I have a lot of information  It's very dull. So ADT alleges that  They not only stole their intellectual property, but they did so in a pretty like James Bondian kind of way so  ADT had invested in zone off and was contracted with son off to do some have Zonoff do some work for them. I  Know the guys at Zonoff. I've known them for years the CEO  Super nice Mike Harris super nice ethical, dude  Basically they had a deal they had an M&A deal that fell through  While they were being shopped when that fell through  They kind of ran out of money. They couldn't pay ADT back for a note and  They were gonna shut down the entire company and then the next day  Ring gave everybody is on off a job 75 people they hired

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  75 people I think all but one took the job and Mike Harris went over now ADT alleged

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Mike Harris took all of ADT's IP because ADT once  Once on off missed that payment ADT got all of their IP. So ADT is like  Mike Harris handed Jamie Simon off one, you know  RIP in a briefcase in a parking lot in Pennsylvania, which sounds really good, but I don't know if that's actually true  So a judge gave them a temporary injunction

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This sometimes happens and you go to court saying look while we're deciding this case  Look while we're deciding this case, can you stop them from selling this infringing device? The judge agreed? So that's bad news for ring  They're gonna miss a big buying season. Meanwhile nest has a very similar device, which they're advertising heavily  and I think it's kind of interesting I I have an article on the verge about this and  Right next to it's gone now because I guess it was a carousel. I got an ADT ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know I should actually say ADT is an advertiser right now on my show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well this I mean part of this is that this is a big and there's a nest ad  So this is a big buying season right now for these kind of security devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody has a new security company or a new security product. So nest just launched theirs  Yeah rain launched theirs and now is put putting it on hold  Wink just launched a system. We've also got almond which is a router company. It's smaller, but they just launched a system  Notion just said that their stuff's gonna work with nest stuff. So oh my god, it's crazy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just shows you it's a big market  the security 20% of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  American homes have monitored security

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But everybody's like interested in having security in my experience with monitored security is I don't like it  We had monitored security we've had it we have it now every business has to have it but the false  You know, it's just kind of annoying the calls in the middle of night poor John took the brunt of those but the calls in  The night because the one of the sensors went off and we never was there ever any how many we must have had a dozen  In two years and there was never any real intruders  And finally at the point where the Petaluma Police Department says you're gonna start paying for these if if we have to keep  That's the problem. Yeah, and I have that monitored security often. Well, there's just issues now  They they call you and that's you know, most of the time we were able to preempt it  John would come down and see what was going on  But I've gone down there to meet the police a couple of middle of the night  rendezvous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I hate that  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Reason yeah, I don't know if it's a good thing for the home. Maybe it is if you're gonna be a long gone a long time  I guess  Well, just have the neighbors look in and feed the cat once in a while water the plants pick up the mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did the cat feed the plants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well as long as we're in the courtroom  Let's not let's not leave the courtroom just yet  The Supreme Court has thrown out the Samsung Apple case remember Apple sued Samsung for saying slide to unlock we own that  Samsung fought it lost fought it lost they finally  Ended up appealing to the Supreme Court SCOTUS declined to hear the appeal. So  Apple does owed slido unlock and Samsung owes them several hundred million dollars for  fringing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good thing we're moving to facial and fingerprint unlocking time. Yeah, it's so funny. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you were talking about this earlier Jeff there were rumors and now it's been  confirmed  that  According to the Department of Justice  AT&T must jettison CNN  For the Time Warner merger to occur  There's some politics in here, of course, because we know the president's not a fan of CNN and some think this is punitive  This is coming from the White House

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been reading Twitter about it, which of course now takes twice as long. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Them I buried the lead Twitter now 280 characters  And  Everybody insists on writing their first tweet to any character tweet, which usually means a bunch of crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, this will this will this will pass over right? I hope so hashtag 280 characters

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is a teen AT&T time working will go to court and  And  Trump's public statements will probably have an impact sure and I mean I but you know one of his public statements during the campaign was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He didn't want the merger to happen at all  Right. He said if I'm elected there will be no TTT time Warner merger, which I'm in favor of let's I don't think it's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Problem is it's a it's a it's not a competitive merger. It's it's a complimentary merger. So this is hard  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last pass decided to use its 200 characters turn 80 characters to tweet 280 characters of bad passwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of this. Oh, I have gotten so many I see so many people tweeting period

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Returned period return. I'd like Pittsburgh Steelers took this occasion to tweet all of its  former players in the football Hall of Fame  Here's a William Carlos Williams poem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the poem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have eaten the plums that were in the ice box and which you were probably saving for breakfast  Forgive me. They were delicious. So sweet and so cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, a good use of 280 characters one of the news organizations. I forget which one put up the Trump bus quote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yes a lot of them I saw that retweeted like crazy. Yeah, here's a good use of 280 characters  Ohio State put up the Ohio State song  Well, you know the eyes of Texas are upon you it might work  Here's one Louise Dover tweeted Obama sucks Hillary sucks Obama sucks Hillary sucks Obama sucks  That's creative Arby's  MGM Studios the Lions roar  It goes on and on and on please kids let's grow up  This is like when the Apple first came out with typefaces and every every letter looked like a ransom note  And emojis you're right if there's a blessing the 280 characters  Stop the goddamn an emoji karaoke's  So, you know so, you know  Hmm somebody said the 280 characters is is Twitter's equivalent of fat Elvis fat Twitter  We're gonna talk about this article and this really I think is gonna be the centerpiece of the show today cuz I really  I found this fascinating. I  Don't know James Bridell. I don't know who he is. He says he's a writer and an artist  It looks like his his  Avatar is Malcolm McDowell from that one where the kids the kids revolt against the  British clockwork orange. No. No, it's an earlier one. What's it called where the the students revolt in the public school?  I can't remember the name of it  Anyway, he says he's a writer and artist but he does he does observe something quite interesting about the the  algorithmically generated videos aimed at children young  Almost it make his pre verbal children that are  decidedly disturbing and  Whether this is intentional or accidental or it's the Russians. We'll talk about that. That's gonna be the centerpiece  Speaking of Russians Marissa Meyer says  She's sorry that Yahoo was hacked and the Russians did it. She testified today in front of the Senate and  she said  you know, I was on my watch and  I  Apologize for the two massive data breaches  She blames the Russians for it. Although there is apparently no evidence that the Russians were involved  She said  Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo  Successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state sponsored hackers  Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users data

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2013 there was a breach of all three billion Yahoo accounts  Yahoo had previously said 1 billion  In March federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a theft of half a billion Yahoo accounts  That's actually the only charge it took at least the first charge against Russian spies for cyber crimes that I know of  But the FBI says the 2013 breach was unrelated  Meyer later said under questioning she didn't know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach  But they they sure are convenience scapegoat  Well, no one knows still who did the 2013 so that's the first time we've heard about miss Meyer since she left Yahoo  Let's see  Gosh there's actually today there is a  We're jam-packed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about the Facebook nudes or are we saving are we saving our no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, why should we save that? That's a heck of a story Facebook. I think we should just go into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook says it can combat revenge porn good. We don't like that. Do Twitter says the same thing  But in order to do it on Facebook you have to upload nudes of yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And news or is it is it is it the actual photos you're afraid are gonna get out  Well, so they hashing your fate or identity or they hashing the actual photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually the actual photo  it says Facebook says if you send the the photo you're worried about it to the company first, it will make sure it doesn't show up because  And they won't have they won't store them. They'll create a digital, you know hash

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which will help the image the interns who make sure the hash work. Well, I'd be nervous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well wait the Daily Beast just put up a story saying that it's actually going to be a person  That looks at these so Facebook workers not an algorithm will look at volunteered nude photos first to stop revenge  Porn here. Let me drop this in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Comments first you upload an explicit image of yourself to Facebook Messenger  Which you can do by starting a conversation with yourself, then you flag it. There's a new flag called non-consensual  intimate image  At that point the social network builds what is referred to as a hash of the image  Facebook says it's not storing the photos  I don't know why anybody would need to look at it  Except I guess it could be misused to buy people to block other photos writer if another user tries to upload Clinton  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  If another user tries to upload the same image on Facebook or Instagram Facebook will test it against its stored hashes and stop it. So  Yeah, I understand because you can't you gotta make sure it really is a  Explicit photo. So some poor person has to go. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that one's okay. Ah like that for like eight hours a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and with a real person involved I'm sure nobody's nudes will ever get compromised

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey boss, I heard there's an opening over there in the in the Facebook standards of practices and I just like to apply

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably don't want to see the nudes for I don't the average American. I don't be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a good job. And I know I've heard of heard from and talked to actually  I don't know if I've personally talked but I know people who have talked to the people who do these kinds of things for  Companies, you know  Twitter and Facebook and and it's a terrible job that burnout is very high  It's gotta be just a terrible job. You don't want that job  But I'm willing to try. I'm just I'll give him a shot. No, I wouldn't do it. You're gonna send your pictures. Oh  That's a good idea  Let me ask my iPhone if there's any brazier pictures of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so hold on hold on the logic of this  So imagine if there were a way that I could make a hash of my own photo and all I send in is the hash

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a program let's be hash of all that would be the way to do it but then they still then wait wait wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then the photo comes in and the alarm goes off says we poop poop. That's a bad photo. That's when you look at oh, you're right  Okay, but don't you have a photo I just said in a hash that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, wait, though. No. No if you send in the hash it has to be unhashed for the computer to actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just saying just saying that you Facebook gives you everybody a  Program they can run locally on their photos. So the photos never do get uploaded just the hash of it. You're brilliant  Jeff, would you call mark and tell him this?  Then it uploads the hash to solve so many of their problem  And the problem of course is the false positive or the or the prankster who wants to keep photos of let's say Hillary Clinton photos off  Facebook so when the alarm does go off that's when a human looks and says no, that's Hillary and lets it through or no  Yeah, that's explicit and blocks it. Yeah, that would be much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then the vulnerable person is only sending in a hash. Yes. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on Facebook. Yeah, it's brilliant. I do say so myself you have marks number column  Mark about these explicit photos, but I want to point out it took Jeff about three seconds to think of the solution  Why is Facebook like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even even the instructions they have you got to share it with yourself and then report it and that's bizarre. Oh, yeah  I  Think you should patent this plus. Yeah, well, there's another problem to it. So let's say that you and your honey  Do something and the he presuming he's the bad guy takes the photos and it's on his phone and you don't have them  So you're fearing what's we put up, but you don't have access to them  That this is my solution to the solve that that's still a problem. Yeah, I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think that I would be honest. That's probably more often the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the nudes that you send them aren't the ones that you're worried about it  No, they're supposed to be the ones you're worried about. No  Cuz then this is just stupid in so many ways. It's just it's just one of those publicity stunts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a publicity stunt and we gave him but it's what about the publicity is gonna be terrible  Is gonna be Facebook wants you to send them to your sex pictures, yeah, this is this this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are we are we I'm we had a very good conversation with Ed bought about Facebook there  I'm getting more and more disturbed by this company in particular, but in general by the big data  A collection going on in all companies. This is the the Kashmir Hills got another great article now  Now this is a lot of this is anecdotal  So I'm curious what you think about this how it's the people you may know section in face  She's been on that for a while and here are the examples, you know, it started with her, right?  She she there her personal story, you know, I don't want to go no, I can't remember all the details  But basically somebody she knows  You know is connected with their family, but nobody else would know  Was offered to her as people you may know on Facebook and it was like, yeah, but that one it went well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's all kinds, but there's all kinds of connections to connection. She does know them  I mean this this this is okay. So let me go there listen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It might be it might not be I mean when you when I read these and they're again, they're anecdotal  Who could who knows it could be a coincidence?  I'll give you a couple  She says she's heard more than a hundred bewildering anecdotes  Here's one a man who years ago donated sperm to a couple secretly so they could have a child  Had Facebook recommend the child as a person he should know  He does know the couple still knows but he's not friends with him on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he still knows the couple and there's friends of friends and if it ties him to that couple then  The fact that that child is connected. It's not hard to see how that happens. Okay, there's another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I agree is pulling data from other places too mostly what I would guess in this case from other Facebook accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean like your credit reports and not your cut it well, do we know they're doing that? I  believe they talked about  pulling data from  Transactions, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wouldn't require that to do this because I'm Jeff's right. The scenario would be the couple  He's not friends with them, but they have a friend in common  right and so  He's friends with somebody who's friends with them and Facebook's algorithm would would parse that and say oh well since you know him

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might know her and if you look at the people they recommend to me it goes way the hell out  I can't figure out. I mean, it's it's it's so far it almost seems random

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alright, how about this one are very loose connections a social workers client called her by her nickname on their second visit  Because she'd shown up in his people you may know  Despite they're not having exchanged any contact information. It's again. I guess again they may live in the same town

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They you know, maybe how did you get recommended to shrink in the first place? It may be through friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This one's tough. But again, you're right  You could you could come up with the ways this could have happened and that's the problem with anecdotal evidence like this a woman  Whose father left her family when she was six?  Had his mistress of the time 40 years later suggested to her at Facebook not his  current mistress or current  Partner but somebody 40 years ago  Once again, we don't know what the connections are. We don't know. Okay  Attorney who wrote I deleted Facebook after a recommended person people you may know a man who was defense counsel on one of my cases  We had only communicated through my work email, which is not connected to Facebook which convinced me Facebook was not connected to Facebook  Which convinced me Facebook was scanning my work email. Yeah, I hear these stories all the time about Amazon Echo as well  remember that we were having a conversation about traveling my husband and I in front of the echo and  All of a sudden Amazon started spamming me with luggage ads. That's somebody actually told me that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I'm gonna go back to my story about the journalist who who told his family and friends on Facebook that oh man  I fell down and I broke my phone and this happened and that happened. He started getting ads for multiple sclerosis  It wasn't because somebody sat at Facebook and said this guy has MS  it's because there were small signals there the advertiser had and  Connections and AI systems to say people have multiple sclerosis happen to do these things and there's signals that are that are not intuitive  We don't know and yeah, welcome to the world of data folks  But it's not some mysterious conspiratorial creepy thing. It's just there is an answer to how this happened  We just don't know what the answer is and we don't like black boxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so Facebook has done deals with back in 2012  It had a deal with data logics to get data from stores where you made purchases in  2016 there was a story out saying Facebook looks at GPS data and  Contracted with square to get their data for both who's in stores and what they're buying  Oh, yes, Facebook does get external data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's just like magazines do deals with axiom  Yes, I'm not saying but  Know that you could opt out of a lot of those companies. I just found that out yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  researchers have determined that between four and eight pieces of data are all that's needed to de-anonymize someone and  Location data actually requires less. So if you start thinking about that  Facebook knows who you are and start making some surprising correlations and that's what's freaking people out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I think cashmere acknowledges that and but what she says this is still cause for concern  he she says she writes behind the Facebook profile you've built for yourself is another one a  Shadow profile built from the inboxes and smartphones of other Facebook users  Contact information you've never given the network gets associated with your account making it easier for Facebook to more completely map your social  Connections really what's happening is we're reaching critical mass that the data  Points that Facebook knows about you have gotten rich enough now that they can they can probably build a pretty good  replica of your social graph  By inference not direct connection, right? Not not even your social graph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is people who you have relationships with that you don't even you may not even be aware of right? So it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here's the example with the attorney Facebook  She says is not scanning the work email of the attorney, of course  I mean it might look like that but it likely has  her work address on file even if she never gave it to Facebook herself because if anyone who has the lawyers address in their  Contacts has showed shared their contacts with Facebook  Which most everybody does then the company can link her to anyone else who has it like the defense counsel in one of her cases  So cashmere is not asserting any creepy. No, she's just pointing out saying this person writing about this  Yeah, she's just pointing out that this is the nature. This is how Facebook works. I  I various people you may know cuz I mean I don't I  Don't see any of my page  It comes up in your feed that's what I thought but I guess I don't know anybody Facebook has gotten less  I mean, you have you know, I always almost always only see is you Jeff  You're sick of me. I know you're sick of me. You I see your tweets. Look at this. This is my Facebook page right now  It's all Jeff Jarvis all the time

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like it it's all Jeff Jarvis and then there's an ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You were what's Richard painter on TV? No, he's he's the ethics. He was the Bush ethics guy who's on he's on MSNBC constantly  He's like Dick Tracy. He talks like Dick Tracy. It's just he's the greatest. I love this guy. He's amazing  I'm trying to look for  Course right now Facebook's not recommend anybody to me. I get it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think maybe they turn this off after Kashmir's article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm I'll go to friends and then go to find friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, maybe I can do it my hand and then no, that's that's sent requests. I know I've seen this before  And and I've accepted a bunch of friends that way and it's mostly people. Oh, yeah, go to friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a little two people on the top  Um, and then scroll find you'll see oh here's people you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PYMK, I know Daniel. I don't know Flores. I don't know Fernando. I pedal him a dead a group used to go there  They're not my dentist anymore  Scott born mutual friend  And I know aunt let's add him

Transcript:  I mean literally he passed away a few years ago. Should should he be in there?  I'll follow him anyway. There hasn't been a lot of this timeline lately  Huh  Mine's pretty terrible. Is it like bad bad suggestions?  But I am never on Facebook right like I so maybe that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they they get very little for me that I like the top person  Like the top person is someone I have no idea there's let's see there's also 71 pending friend requests. So oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got 960

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like for Facebook's probably like I give up with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But did for a while it did for a while. No one could could it make a friend request for me for about two years  And I kind of enjoyed it. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just ignore everything on Facebook. It's very hard. I you always talk about moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff and and I understand that and of course I agree with you  But at the same time it's very hard not to sometimes look at this stuff  Even if you know better and say it's kind of creepy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why it needs explanation the creepiness is the mystery and that's why transparency matters  that's why just saying this is what's happening folks and and and they may not want to because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of people but okay. I don't think that it is just creepy  I think people are taking Facebook's signals or  signals from other data and they're applying it towards things like credit report or credit card  mortgage lending insurance payments and  They're making actual real-world decisions based on this and people don't understand  It's gone out of their control social redlining  Social redlining and I would argue that some of the same worries we have about  For example that the YouTube story we're gonna talk about later are very similar issues here. We're automated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are we don't understand they're closely related. I agree. Yeah, but but but that doesn't mean that we outlaw them now  It means we try to understand them better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't understand how a computer so this is MIT actually put out  I want to say it was two weeks ago that some good research MIT Tech Review had some an article about how  Researchers are trying to open up the black box of AI  Because what you do when you're building a neural network when you're building these kind of algorithms  Depending on how you're teaching the computer, but you're giving it lots of examples  You're tweaking it when it's right to help push it towards the right answers the answers you want  But the computer figures all this out on its own  So we really don't actually understand how it's coming to some of the conclusions that comes to all we can do is say  Yeah, that's right. Good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, you know my list of people is actually pretty good. There's probably about about 15 people are here. I would like to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of ones. I don't but here's a posting from Stanley Lieber and it's he's I don't even know who he is  It's a it's actually the images in this are great. Do you know who he is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this was this is an example of technopatic, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, let me let me just mention it and yeah, you all can be the judge by the way  His title is you won't understand this  He said this is my exit interview from social media and he and he kind of talks about each  service and  Then talks about the the insights he's learned. I remember the internet before Google  F you forever Google for breaking email for everyone in the world  F you forever for enticing users who don't know any better into relying upon your services and then shuddering them with little warning  Your extensions to establish standards and ever-changing policies make it increasingly impossible for individuals to host and control their own information  Yes, I am aware. This is no accident  Search quality is no longer a core competency of Google's the Internet's premier search engine  Two people type the same search each receives a different result. Yes, I'm aware. This is likewise  No accident the quality of ads displayed alongside various Google services has steadily devolved from semi relevant to absolutely irrelevant at all times  Yes, I'm aware. This is no accident  Then he's talking about he has negatives in each column and malware served is one of them. That's true insight  This is kind of a joke Google does not want you to know or remember anything if at all possible  Then he talks about Facebook  Mandatory nonlinear curation of user contributed content malware served gamification of personal interaction  Degrades human health. I can't I can't disagree with him on that gamification  Right. That's what they're doing of personal interaction  Degrades human health. It's bad for you  No  He says Facebook provides worldwide 24 7 telepathic content with every contact with every person  I or members of my extended network have ever met  How many degrees of separation between me and the worst person alive?  Now that person knows that my mom threw up after breakfast and wants to offer advice  Twitter I kind of enjoyed this Twitter worldwide  24 7 telepathic content with every person I  Or people I used to think of his friends ever met or favorited or we tweeted  How many degrees of separation between me and the worst person alive now that person knows the GPS coordinates of my bedroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gamification of personal interaction degrades human health you see but hold on right there. That's the line that got quoted  Right. I know is that by the way, that's me. Yeah, well others did as well. Okay, and and  It's just it there's a damage being done here and that's what concerns me I'm about to give up  I'm tired of this fight. I think there's a damage being done to us the game of I think it's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What what used to be a benevolent in fact valuable?  Thing in life, which was interaction between two humans on a real genuine intimate level has been degraded  Into these into these tweet storms. Hold on Leo. Hold on  Reality check so I you know hear this oh my god panic panic panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So go through your Facebook feed and point out the first piece of degrading horrible crap you find  You're gonna be you're gonna be scrolling for a few hours. Really? It's yeah  I don't see degrading horrible crap in my and I use Facebook a lot. So it's gonna it's gonna open up stuff to me now  And even even Twitter, I mean, you know unless you unless you want to go follow the dirt, right?  It's all friends and nice people. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're losing sight of that yeah, but it's  It's more subtle than that. It's more subtle than that. Oh  It's it's uh, I don't know. I think it's pseudo uh relationship  So there's been okay, no stop. Okay, so there's plenty of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This guy, you know, jeff you can scream techno plant panic  But there are plenty of people who have bemoaned to the fact that these  Online services in even software and apps are  Gamifying things to get you to spend more time to boost their metrics and a lot of people  Are rightly concerned about this kind of digital manipulation  Hey stacey, we make a living doing that rain headlines and journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, what we do. Yes, we do but we also we're not that good at it. That's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, we're not that good at it. That's the difference. That's exactly right. Okay, we're not that good at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we also offer i'm not i'm not trying to be holy i'm just saying  That this is this is a thing that's happened. It's also I was gonna  Make the point that we have been worried about this with tv forever. Yeah, and and we have and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See this is this is exactly what moral panic is the tv is going to ruin society that that gives no respect  To the members of society that we are such people that we could be pulled along. I don't believe that without this debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then we do get unfettered manipulation and I would say so I actually tweeted this because I thought this was a really good example of  digital manipulation that is  Horribly uncool and takes advantage of vulnerable people and it was uh the internetting with amanda hess column from the new york times this week  Which was a four-minute video talking about beauty apps and filters for various  us  instagram snapchat, etc  and  Basically, the idea was that they're pushing just insane standards of beauty like facial bleaching nose mushing and all of these other things  To give you give young girls  Plastic looking faces  Um  and the  They talked about how gamification is really driving these girls back and forth and it does have a measurable effect on their self-esteem  And we can't ignore that and we shouldn't ignore that  And you can call it techno panic  But I think we should be having these conversations because otherwise we're just giving them a pass to take advantage of everyone  And that's not cool  And that's that's my thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but but but the bottom line  It's people doing the bad stuff. Yeah, well it's and the norms that we need to create the norms  You're right. We have the conversation but blaming just the technology in the platform. No, no, no  There are people who are doing bad things. It's not blame. It's the corporations using

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Technology in ways that were never possible that around leah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could also say that the technology exists and people come in and exploit what was meant for good  Yes  Well, how did matt cutts make his make his salary right because something good was created that people then exploited for bad  And and they have to put enough resources into it to try to stop that from happening  But the chicken and egg here is not that the big bad technology company comes along and says how can we ruin society and make?  A fortune doing so I don't believe that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what you hear these kinds of pieces scale and that is what's scaring people. There are a couple things that are very scary  One you can very cheaply learn how to gamify people incredibly effectively  So ab testing costs nothing on these platforms, right?  So you've basically scaled the ability to manipulate people incredibly effectively and that is  That is something we should be talking about  And what do you want to do about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the question. I think i'll tell you what I think we need to hold corporations feet to the fire and this is going to get  uh continue with this next segment, which we're going to talk about the  Gamification of one-year-olds and their attention  Uh, but I think we need I think these companies and this is what scott galloway's saying as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A time of record. We also have to hold individuals who do this stuff. See it's you're blaming strictly the platform. You're not blaming the actors  Well, who you mean you can't?  Who do you mean? No, I know no, I mean whoever the schmuck is who makes that that that bad thing that goes to kids  Think about the platform as a state

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a state you have to enact laws to prevent bad things as a platform you have to  laws are probably not the right but enact rules and punish people and right now I think the  Issue especially with this youtube thing is that they're not actually paying attention  They're not devoting the resources to police the platforms for these bad actors worse than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're actively abrogating their responsibility because of the holy grail of growth  In the stock market and you can say that for twitter you can say that for facebook growth is everything and that's why they're abrogating their responsibility because it's financially  Important to them that they have this kind of user growth. They need to gamify. Let me come in and advocate for the devil here to both of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number number one  Uh, I am what i'm trying to suggest here is you don't only go after the platform  There are actors who are manipulating the platform to do bad things. You've got to go after them  You can't just say the technologist should fix this that's that the person who's doing the bad act  But don't you agree with stacy that the platforms have a responsibility number two number two  The platforms do have a responsibility right, but you are way underestimating the difficulty that scale brings. Well, that's the argument  Let's take  Let me finish this one. Let me finish this one. Okay, let me finish this. I got two against one here  Normally i'm the interrupter. I know but I get two against one here  Al franken, how could you not have seen that rubles? I bought those ads. Well, come on. We all know that it's sophistication  They weren't looking for the signal of rubles and political ads. It was only after the fact they said oh crap rubles and political ads  Right and there was no system in there. There's built-in scale is hard. Yes scale is profitable, but scale is also hard  Scale is what enables your aunt mary to sell her jam scale is what enables us all to make videos and podcasts  And make a living at it scale is what enables all this good stuff  But scale is also difficult now should we hold them responsible? Yes, but in a reasonable way  And just saying everything is their fault the darn platforms do this while we're taking advantage of all the stuff  I don't think that's just being I don't think it's being honest  And I also think i'm just being productive because if you go after the platforms somehow you've also gone after the bad  Actors who are manipulating the platforms actually we are in league with the platforms against those guys, but we're not treating it that way  Okay now i'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so couple things one when it's a money-making issue  These companies find it's worth their while to actually deal with their problems that are caused by scale  So we see this with things like crappy search results. Google for example comes in and is like, oh hey, you know what?  We're seeing a lot of people do these stupid how-to articles that are useless content. We're going to start downgrading those  Facebook does it too with um  Upward no up. Thank you. I was like the headline site rich by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was started with the best of motivations up worthy was and did the worst to media. I know they're they're lovely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not evil, but they were gaming at the system. So you've got both

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gaming by google because you know, no, no, no, you're you know, she's right jeff. I mean  link farms demand media  Time and time again, you're right  There are bad actors who say we're going to take advantage of the algorithm make a lot of money and when those things happen  Google is able to stop it. That's why mac cuts has a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. No, no, no, no, no, jeff. You said you let me you said you let me finish and you're pulling the up worthy straw man

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the one who raised up worthy it's yeah, but don't use it as a straw man  It's one example the rest of this is to inform the public up with his motor was to use these techniques to inform people  And get them jeff. I think they went all off jeff. I listen to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, don't be don't be mean. Okay, let me finish  After okay, so they have made these efforts, but when it comes to things that are  profitable in a way  That isn't significant to them and doesn't appear to have a lot of harm  I guarantee you they're going to start having people moderate the youtube kids content after all this kerfuffle because it's not going to be  Worth it to them, but up until this point up until someone pointed it out  They were content to let this go and the reason they'll figure it out is because disney and nicolodian are going to be like  Uh, hello. Your brand is being totally tarnished and they're going to pull their content. So  The point here is these guys  They are  They are not benign they understand scale is hard  But when they want to they can address it and so I don't think it's wrong to sometimes say oh guys  Uh, you're letting a lot of crap through here and you need to fix it. It's not techno panic. It's a legitimate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Democratic way to like engage with a platform. All right pause. Yeah, we agree. We agree. We agree  But there's two there's two one more second. All i'm saying is that if that's all you do  Then that means that you blame the technology for everything I say that in addition to that you need two more things  One is you need to go after the actors who actually do the bad acts  And I don't hear a lot of that going on very hard to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's international the problem is it's international and law enforcement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Acknowledge that number two is let's acknowledge that that this isn't that easy for the platform to say oh rubles and ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why didn't you know that it's easier for the platform than for interpol?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, i'm saying it all comes together and i'm saying that we also as individuals  We have a responsibility to change the norm  So we don't go supporting fights online and trollers behavior. I think we all agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of these things have to happen, but I think stacy's point is very well taken that if you want to be a platform  I agree with you no longer get to say. Oh, we're just you know, a common carrier. We're not responsible  And I feel that many companies, you know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter is a very good example. I think facebook's a very good example google may be a pretty good example  Many platforms just say, you know this we're just a carrier. It's not our fault  Let's take a break  Uh, because this conversation will continue and we get to this, uh, the something is wrong on the internet  And I think we've pretty much done it already, but go ahead  Well, I have to show you these videos and uh, and I want to warn people  That not to let your two-year-olds watch what we're going to do in a minute because it's disturbing  And if you're uh, if I don't think it's so disturbing that an adult will be harmed by it  But I hate to think of a little kid watching some of these things. We're going to take a break come back with more, uh, jeff jarvis  professor of journalism university university of new york  the the master of the socratic dialogue  stacy higginbotham  Uh journalist par excellence stacy on iot.com and i'm just the guy sitting in between them  Our show today brought to you by ero  Eero started in what it was about 2015 26 early 2016. I remember reading about him and getting very excited and pre-ordering  Uh, it was the very first, uh,  Consumer mesh system there have been business systems designed to do this in fact, we'd used some  But nobody ever thought of doing this in the house euro did and it was brilliant  The idea of not not a wi-fi extender but solving every, you know  increasingly worse wi-fi issues  With a mesh wi-fi network that includes a base station and multiple access points was brilliant  Since then they've learned from hundreds of thousands of systems and one of the advantages of being the market leader is  That means they know a lot about what makes wi-fi  Break and what makes it work the second generation. Eero is now out. Oh, I love it  I put it here the ero and two beacons the the little  satellite stations in my house  And it is it is the best euro we've ever had more speed more range same high quality design  Actually, I think it's even more elegant the euro beacons just plug into the wall. They have a little nightlight  So we I put them in the halls  And it's very convenient  With the addition of the third five gigahertz radio the second generation eros tri-band  And by the way twice as fast as its predecessor so you could do a lot more watch more movies listen to more music  surf and  and email to your heart's content and  They've added a thread radio. So now they can connect to low power devices like locks doorbells other sensors and  more  If you need more easy to add another beacon every 1500 square feet should have its own  You plug it into a wall. It's easy if there's an outlet there's wi-fi  We have I like euro so much that I gave my mom my original system  Went out to providence, Rhode island set it up for her  And it really solved the problem  She had as a art studio out in the backyard that she couldn't get wi-fi and she really loves listening to internet radio streaming internet radio  Including this show  And so now she can do that we put it I put an ero out there and an ero in her kitchen  I have myself we have three eros in our home  And I just it's a set it forget it and euro has so many nice features now including  uh great parental control features  Uh, we we can you can identify every device that attaches to your network and associate it with a member of the household  So I have all of the things michael uses his phone his computer his tablet  In his account and I can say I can actually do it with the echo I could say echo pause michael's wi-fi  And suddenly he's offline  It's not I do it. I do it because I love him. We do it because we care  We actually have a set time that the internet goes off 10 pm doesn't come back on till nine the next morning  It also filters so he can't see stuff. We don't want him to see on the internet really works very very nicely  Uh, of course the adult computers aren't filtered  But they're well they are because they're filtered against malware and other attacks  And the ero automatically updates the firmware gets updated all the time. I'll give you an example, you know about the crack vulnerability  that that  Man, it was possible for a bad guy to snoop on your wi-fi  Within 24 hours of that being revealed it was revealed on the monday by tuesday  Eero had automatically put out pushed out a fix to all of their customers  Nobody's that good. They're the best incredibly fast response time  Automatic updates. It's what you need what you have to have in an iot device  And it is the best router out there  Say simply enough ios and android app makes it easy to set up but also easy to control no more dead zones  No more buffering wi-fi that works. We've got free overnight shipping because I know you want it now  Eero eero.com use the offer code twig and  You might want to consider my example if you've got family members who are complaining about their internet  It'd be a very nice thing this thanksgiving or this holiday season to go visit them and  Have a nice package of eros wrapped up for them  Eero.com get free overnight shipping with the offer code  twig  Something is wrong on the internet  So what's basically happening here is happening not just on youtube but everywhere the idea that  Uh videos are starting to be algorithmically generated with algorithmically generated titles and hashtags  because  People have observed that little kids  Non-verbal little kids are using tablets watching  YouTube and some of them fairly benign like this one. This is the finger family song  watching youtube videos enjoying them  and then

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mashing the next button or auto playing to the next video now. This is the i'll show you this because it kind of sets it up  This is the finger family and some people might think this is a little creepy to begin with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you now when you're kids commercials out there kids shows out there? I consider creepy too, but the kids like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bright colors weird. Remember non-verbal and by the way, it's something a child of three or four  Identifies with it's things they know their family their hands their bedroom  Uh, so it's like any nursery song  It's you know, it's very approachable. And by the way, it's very catchy. It couldn't stop singing it after I watched this video  Here's the song  We've gone to finger family park where there's a giant hand  and  And a boy and a girl on the hand dancing. It has a little bit of a bollywood flavor to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daddy finger daddy finger

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm guessing this must have originated in india or somewhere like that  By the way notice still worse notice the subscribe to our channel suggested little miss muffett nerf nursery rhyme  Of course something will auto play right after it. So that's the I don't know if this is the original but that's  It's kind of a benign example. It's a little creepy. They got parents and kids on fingers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I like to say barney's creepy it's like barney  What's what's that one with the big the big roly poly beasts walk in the colorful?  land

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  British one. Oh teletubbies. Yeah teletubbies. Yeah, that's creepy  And then there's this there's another meme some of these by the way are created  Intentionally created creepy like from 4chan and others. This is the meme of the wrong heads  So this is where disney might get involved. There's aladdin  Same song  And now different heads from the aladdin movie  Are on there and a little kid from a different disney  I don't actually think she comes from disney at all is crying. She's another character from despicable me. That's right  So you could say well, that's not so bad that's teaching kids  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's coming out to cry them. She's telling them that that's the wrong head, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I can see that this is this is not that bad that's benign  Okay. Now we get creepy you ready to get creepy  And we can't watch the whole thing. You can read  The article james bridal's which is very long, which is long on  medium  But this so what's happened? This one has been generated humans have to create these  But he says small animation teams because it's very primitive animation can crank these out  They're auto generated in terms of names and text so the name of this is buried alive outdoor playground finger family  song nursery rhymes animation education  learning video  Uh, and this combines a lot of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stuff you might have seen. Oh, we're gonna have a hamburger emoji fight now  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, their cheese is in the right spot. Well, they also they're purple now here comes the hulk on a motorcycle mcdonald's by the way featuring  prominently here  Um, oh actually I jumped ahead didn't I?  No, I should yeah, I should go to the beginning which is the creepiest part. Here's the joker  Walking along he throws a can at a guy on a motorcycle with spider-man  Knocks him off motorcycle crashes. He picks up  That creepy creepy creepy cry picks up a spider-man  Now here comes some creepy clown does the same thing to the hulk knocks him out picks him up  Carries him off  Uh, then this is really creepy. He's a young woman sitting in her kitchen  Who is it? Elsa? It's Elsa from frozen  Yeah, and then she's just not dressed in her stuff and then  He sprays something on her and she passes out and carries her off  Is that punisher? Who is that? It's some  Cartoon character here's purple spider girl death comes in with a scream mask and a scythe knocks her out  Again the scream now I  The problem is because of the title on this a parent might end bright colors and the listen to the music the playful music a parent might  Very well accidentally let a kid watch this. Maybe they started with daddy finger  Now they've been buried alive these characters  and they're  Dancing around them, but fortunately this gets really creepy here comes  Baby heads on  I don't know what's going on here. Uh, another spider character in the hulk with baby heads spotted they call the police  The police woman is gonna come rescue the people is also Elsa also Elsa  Well, but see little kids they go.

It's

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this creepy it seems creepy to me and I wouldn't want a one-year-old to watch it it seems no, of course not nightmare material  And and there's a lot more of this worse  it's not the worst I won't show you the worst stuff, but  um, you wouldn't I think so you said stacey you have a  personal experience to relate to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so Anna  My daughter she watches youtube a lot and she's actually really cautious about what she watches because she is  You know, we've had the debate about what you can't see you can't unsee on the internet  So every now and then  She comes across and there are characters  It is a creepy show that's like on adult swim or something  And they put these in the types of videos that she likes to watch. I think it was a minecraft video. So  It's not necessarily for kids and this wasn't on youtube kids, but it just came through

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's the other point. This is not on just on regular youtube. This is on the specially protected

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For kids only youtube kids. That's the key to the problem here  And that's where stacey's point before is right that you've got to if you're taking responsibility, you've got to do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't f it up. Well in google's messed. I mean so in in this case  That's a problem, but they also with their kids content, you know, once a kid is above 13  Because and they're not under cop-up protection and amazon does the same thing. They suddenly go into this world of like  Oh, you're an adult now. Whereas many of us who have 13 year olds or have experienced 13 years olds would be like, oh, it's  not really  But yeah, so  my daughter like saw these things and like  Freaked out and she comes running to me and she's like  Who are these creepy people? And apparently they're super popular, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are in fact our 14 year old watches some really creepy videos called hug me i'm scared  Um, and there there's an it's an ironic I think for that age. I don't know  um  So what bridal writes is the system is complicit in the abuse  He says youtube and google are complicit in the system the architecture they have built  To extract the maximum revenue from online video  Is being hacked by hacked in the sense of used  By persons unknown  To abuse children perhaps not even deliberately but at a massive scale his point is there are millions of these  And he thinks that there is some responsibility  At that google and youtube have  But it would be nice. Oh go on. I think that your point jeff is well taken that given the volume of videos on youtube  There's an issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be very difficult to police this but if you're if you're putting out a child safe product  That's where stacy and I could agree more that is where  You say above all that you've got to go to the expense and you've got to have the scarcity to say that there's some structure  That you can be near perfectly guaranteeing that it's child safe or else you're hurting your brand. You're hurting children. You're hurting  Um, you're hurting your everything half you're hurting your partner and everything you do and then there's a separate  So so all I'm saying is yeah, we we we absolutely agree there they'll so that's where the scale thing  Doesn't really you're going to limit the scale of it  You're going to be limited in size because you're going to have quality and we get back to quality and flight to quality is not  A bad thing now. Can you do that with youtube as a whole?  That's where it becomes much more difficult  But it's uh, but but in terms of this this limited project. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the ongoing conversation we've had for the last few years about  And by the way, it's starting what's interesting is starting to migrate into the public sphere as well  the non-technical public sphere about how  this  free speech  Democratization that the internet promised has kind of turned a little sour in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but you see that's the problem leo. That's that's where michael don jerks  Yeah, but not all people are jerks not a small percentage a thin layer  But now you're now you're throwing out the entire internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I know i'm not i'm not i'm not but I I feel like there are people  In jeff you might you probably you and I probably agree but this idea that there  There are bad people or people who behave like jerks on the internet. That is always going to be the case  The question is  I think we have to figure out how to deal with them  and ideally the platforms will take a take a role here not in a  You know, maybe not banning people or maybe establishing clear rules  But also give people on the platform's tools to avoid things. Well, they have those tools and that's well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I mean youtube kids has blocking and everything and I think that that's the rationale. That's the justification Facebook and google and others use  well  Our users will curate it our users will  Will do it. Uh, our users will kill fake news, but I don't see any evidence as that's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right and so that's  And that's where we get into the questions of scale and abuse of the scale  And that's I mean, it's basically people hacking the algorithms and we got it. It's your  Go ahead. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm on lags. I didn't hear you go. Keep keep going. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to figure out how to  Recognize that when it happens and put a stop to it as quickly as possible and that I mean that was matt cuts his job  You know for search so I think we just have to figure that out across

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially across tell parents to stop using youtube as a babysitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's yes, but youtube isn't necessary. I mean perfectly good parents put a phone in front of their kids  Yeah, let my kids watch tell it toby's. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The difference was you could trust if it was on pbs or was bbc you could kind of trust it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you bought a cd rom and you knew what was on it. Yeah  And I even edited out the bad stuff in bambi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I made a special videotape of bambi without the bad stuff. I think disney's gonna arrest you now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, disney doesn't like when you do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was for personal consumption only

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, I I think I think that the  Stacey the the larger issue which I don't think we've kind of dealt with is the full implications of scale  Right, and i'm gonna pardon me here get your drinking glasses ready folks  If you go back to gutenberg  The problem is sorry the problem was that you had a scale that was one scribe one book one year  And and society could deal with that and you went to people who read the books out loud to you and you knew  What they were and they were guaranteed that they're fun  Then suddenly oh my god all these books and erasmus says there's too many of them. It's going to ruin society  We can't handle this right then we cope with norms. We cope with systems to grapple with that  Now we're in exponentially larger scale  And the scale is wonderful on the one hand it opens up the possibility that we can all publish and all make podcasts and all these  Wonderful things but then inevitably come  Spammers which is first the economic piece and that you're right is where the company is motivated to hire met cuts  To fix the spam. It's an economic problem both ways around  Yeah, but at first that happens the next thing that happens are the really nefarious actors at first though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the problem and this is where people are complaining the first reaction the company has is oh good  We're gonna make even more money  That they only are only when their feet are put to the fire  Do they stop this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so it's our part of our job in the ecosystem is to put their feet to the fire which which I agree with but  But how we do that i'm part of the i i help start the open brand safety network where we're identifying the worst of the worst  Of the fake news sites  There is money going from major advertisers still to those places because nobody has put their feet to the fire to say hello  What sleeping giants did with advertisers and bright part? We need to do it large scale now  So i'm agreeing with all this my problem with this entire discussion though  Is that if you stop blaming the platform and expecting they can fix it you'll both be disappointed and be harming  The good that can come from it just like you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, they don't have to fix it, but they don't have to be complicit in it and I feel right now  They're complicit in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I see that's where that's where I disagree  I don't think I don't think there's somebody sitting there saying oh if we get rid of this horrible creepy stuff we could lose  Uh a hundred thousand dollars. No, I think it's what we talked about last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not they're saying it's not worth our time to deal with or they're doing what twitter did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We talked about this last week where the guy the safety guy go from twitter goes to twitter and says  There's all these spots and spam and russian actors and twitter says yeah, but we need the growth numbers right now  Don't you think that happens all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, they are complicit. We know they're complicit, but they all of them. I don't think so  I think that facebook and google are at a higher plane  I don't think they sit there and say we can make money off of crap  I think they realize at some level that the crap is damaging to them and damaging to what they do and to their missions  They are not dealing with it. No, they're not and that's the problem  Yeah, and do we need to hold their feet to the fire to make them do it? Yes  But the problem I have is the cynicism that says oh the only reason they run these platforms to make money  And they'll do anything to make money and they'll put all this crap up there. I that's that's that's naive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is actually to make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think the only reason they're doing to make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do you really believe that mark zuckerberg cares about connecting the world? Yes. I absolutely do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe I believe that Larry I believe that larry and sarah gay absolutely  Absolutely believe that they are they are making the world's knowledge accessible absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But  They are there to make money as publicly traded companies. They are there to be all we all are we're they're here to eat, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah part of part, you know  And even and and and I said we're not rich people but even rich people  Uh, then think they have more power than they have and try to uh, look at rickett's closing dna info and laist and all that this week  Um, you know, yeah, we are human  And and we have to check our motives  But yes, I absolutely believe that I have no problem believing this sucker if I didn't believe that I sure as hell wouldn't have taken  Their money to start the news integrity initiative. I wouldn't be if I didn't believe that google were essentially good  I wouldn't believe it's worth being on a show every week about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh see i'm on the show because I I feel like someone has to act as a check against their power  I think it's both

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I didn't believe there was something good  Essentially here it wouldn't be worth checking them then screw it  I believe there's something good here that's worth preserving and that's their stewardship of the internet  And that's what worries me is they've got to make sure they're responsible stewards

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I can agree with keeping them responsible stewards. That makes sense. There is also the the issue of scale. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sure, uh erasmus didn't like all the book scoop murk was putting out but  We're at a much different scale now. It's global  it's uh, it's  Pervasive in fact scales the problem. It's hard to correct because of scale scales the benefit and the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was the same then we'll figure it out  If the problem is if you don't do you do you give up hope that we can figure it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I but I do  I do think  That we can't that their their motives are not always pure and we have to realize that  And we have to question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That because otherwise I agree with you stacey. You can assume their motive is profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's not then they're mismanaging their if that's all if that's all you presume it is then i'm not saying it's all but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you think about matters. Well, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me tell you something mark zuckerberg is and his company are not out  Optimizing the news algorithm for beneficial benefit to society that would that's not they are out there. That's right  They're optimizing the news algorithm for engagement and money  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There no they would say that they would say I want to connect people what the people want they're giving them that yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Engagement you were responsible so they can make I think that's a bit of a cop out, but that's what they would say  Yeah, but that's the point is that mark can say all the things he wants to say about his lofty goals and ambitions  but in fact the news algorithm is not  Optimized for lofty goals and ambitions is optimized to make money as as with any company  It's also here's the confluence the confluence of late stage capitalism  with  immense power  Computational power with immense computational data and a critical mass  Of of knowledge and data and you combine all those you've got a toxic stew  That is optimized  In a way that is bad for society

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well, well that's where I think you're going way overboard. This is world-breaking mike godwin mike godwin should have a new law here  And and he's been he's been screaming on twitter for the last week or so more eloquently. I started following him  I know I about why we're that  He's arguing the evidence that we're in a moral panic his definition of a moral panic was  That when you're when you have to convince people that it's all awful and they don't really feel that way  Then you're trying to instill a moral panic and his argument is that most people keep using facebook  They're fine with facebook and I repeat my challenge before go through your facebook feed and find what's so ugly and awful in society  Ruining in it. It's not there. It's not there  I think it's more subtle actors manipulate this. Yes. Are there bad people are there trolls that I hate on twitter?  Do I wish twitter would stop enabling women to be terrorists?  Yes, do they need to have higher standards apps of friggin loot?  Lee is do not do not be evil good enough. No be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, it has to be the new standard if your standard for damage is whether people like it or not  Then we should just have mcdonald's food served at every meal for any product on earth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo's do people like it or not any product?  That's your starting standard is there a market for it that's a every single product we make including books

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't mean it's good for society doesn't mean it's helpful. Yeah, that's how newspapers are sold leo people like crap  Yeah, but well fortunately I think magazines. I think your mindset it does come from that  generation where newspapers were  published  By people who had a higher felt a higher mission

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where I could man man I could introduce you to lots of publishers. Not all I think are not all the new york post  You can't say the post is a higher mission  I think it's worse than as much as silicon, but I think the new york times and the washington post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  uh, I think dean beskay and  uh, I think they have they I think have a sense of  Societal obligation that's high maybe not the publisher but the but the editorial staff that of good papers have a higher  Who's making the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and there may not be making that was the problem we we an editorial just said all that that money stuff  Somebody else will handle that we didn't take responsibility for it. We didn't know we can't stand above that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We we were awful, but that's the way our stewards. That's the way it was supposed to be  It was a division of labor  And that the and and we try to do that here  The editorial side is not impinged upon by the money-making side and it led to poor stewardship from us on the editorial side

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we didn't take responsibility for the decisions being made and that's how we ended up in clickbait land

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't you think it's worse now?  I mean don't you think if you I mean  I admit this wasn't a paragon of virtue, but I think it was a lot  It was a lot better model than what we've got today. There's nobody at facebook. There's nobody at facebook arguing  I well, maybe there is I don't know arguing. Well, we got us we got to do something about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I oh, I I think I think there are I think the problem is no it's scarier than that in a way leo  Here's here's the thing i've seen and i've seen this again and again in their public pronouncements  We think oh they know how to do this just they're just choosing not to make money  No, the problem is it's bigger than them. They don't know how to do it  They don't know how to fix this. Otherwise, they fix it. They don't know how that's what's scarier  Right is that that's what scale brings

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I think there's pressure on them not to fix it. I think there's economic pressure on them not to fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they honestly don't know I think we I think we impute a lot more brilliance  And ability in them than they have well then it's a runaway train with no conductor  No, this is this is called progress in the future and some things are gonna go right and some things are gonna go wrong  And the problem is don't lose sight of the things that are going right  There's a tremendous amount that's right about the internet and this discussion is entirely throwing that out with the bathwater  That's that's what I fear. That's what I hear the discussion all around right now is oh my god  The internet is broken. The internet is horrible. No, but you use it every day  You're not bombarded with crap every minute of every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't you're using I don't think everyone thinks the internet is broken or horrible. I think people are asking legitimate questions  About what the implications are when their decisions are manipulated by social platforms  when these platforms  abdicate their responsibility in certain areas  And how we're going to handle that and how we should hold them responsible  The role that these platforms understanding the role these platforms play in our lives and the implications  That's not a bad thing to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's i'm agree with you stacey. I agree, but that's not that's not the tone that i'm seeing  If you go to my my friends at the guardian, they have gone full utter techno panic  And and and there was a columnist they had columnist they had two days ago whose whole lead was I hate the internet  I hate everything about the internet. I hate the internet. I'm hearing that tone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Constantly constant that is the way these things get debated  I mean look at look at what happens with things about you know  Look at the soda tax in new york city  You have people in either extreme and then you have people debating throughout the spectrum  And so yes, do extreme viewpoints get people to pay attention to an issue?  yes, then they will come in and have these discussions and  I understand your worries about a techno panic, but I feel like you're constantly bringing  You run all the way down that slippery slope and you're like techno panic, but  Then you come back up and you're like, okay, I agree with you on this but  But you're kind of doing the opposite. We have this discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is that I see the discussion look at look at the congressional hearings that we're having a discussion right now  But people sort of like al franken  Right who knows better the whole rubles thing it was for it was for show  Right and it was it was scoring points against not only facebook, but the net  And that's a guy who knows better and a guy who's smart and that's where it's happening right now and the result can be  What we see in the eu is you can get horrendous decisions like the right to be forgotten  You can get decisions like like charging the platform is 500 million dollars every time something wrong is there  you can get to the point where where  We expect them to decide what's right and wrong  We were seeing the fruits of this and that's that's this is not a an idle worry  It's we are empowering the politicians to do bad things to our beloved internet when we  We talk crap on the internet all the time  And we don't also remind them of the good that we have to preserve the good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me instead of using the sound bite from al franken give you a quote from the article he wrote in  Your favorite publication the guardian  Um, oops, i've gone i've gone away from it  Uh, and the title is we must not let big tech threaten our security freedoms and democracy. There's an opinion piece  And he says last week's hearings demonstrated these companies  May not be up to the challenge they've created for themselves  In some instances it seems they failed to take common sense precautions  To prevent the spread of propaganda misinformation  and hate speech  The platforms at big tech and I actually think this is pretty astute the platforms at big tech have designed  May now be so large and unruly  That we can't trust the companies to get it right when they do start paying attention if you have five million advertisers a month  Using your highly sophisticated nearly instantaneous ad platform. Can you ever really know who all of them are?  Can you ever so he's he's answering his question by the way, okay, well what do you want to happen then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so what's what's the answer that we we prevent people from advertising so aunt mary can't sell her jam

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That we have a large they can develop. Okay, jeff they can actually develop  Algorithms that pay attention to signals that are important to question to say hey this looks suspicious  Maybe we punt this up to someplace else franklin's franken's being positive here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's saying but he's saying with great power goes great responsibility and these companies have to be held  To account I think that's fair reasonably

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it cannot be it will not ever be the same as running the new york times  And we don't want it to be because then because you and I couldn't get into the new york times  Right, that's the show would not be on mainstream broadcast, right?  And so and so if we want to control the safe completely cleaned up atmosphere. What's the what's the level of responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not saying it needs to be controlled and safe  He's saying that they need to put things in place to  Make this  That to to make them not complicit so they see when things are going wrong  It's basically like saying hey you built this awesome city  But you know what?  Maybe you should put some street lights in because sometimes it gets dark and your people are going to want to see what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what he's saying. We're agreeing about that. We're agreeing about that. But but but it's very important to have a discussion of where is that line?  And and what the implications are and who gets kicked off?  well, I saw a list of uh, you know,  Of of of unreliable sites that shouldn't be advertised on well some odd things got onto that list  And what what happens when bright board ends up that list and what you know, where are you in this world?  This is not easy. This is really hard. And again, I don't think we should presume that they know how to do this  They're just refusing to which is kind of I think what frankenstein  Which I agree with is maybe they don't know how to do it. But let's acknowledge how hard this task is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really hard everyone he says they need to figure it out. That's that's also  part of this he's saying you can't just  I mean it'd be like if someone  Created frankenstein you created frankenstein now. We got to figure out how to  How to rein him in how to make sure that he doesn't go terrorize anyone to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's just it's very hard to keep control of frankenstein danger danger folks danger danger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's exactly what iran says and china says and you're saying a precedent and a mechanism that we we have to we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you suggesting jeff that should be no regulation? No, I'm not suggesting that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm suggesting have the discussion from saying the internet is a good let's protect the good of it  Here's the here's the question cut says the discussion here the question here the question franken says

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we agree. We all agree. There's good stuff there  How do you're the questions franken says we have to think about how did big big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is it using our so that's right there that's loaded as hell doesn't control my life. That's that's fundamentally  Patronizing and consulting and insulting to the citizens who vote  That's that's the exact answer that says oh the technology makes us do bad things  No, a few bad people do bad things using the technology big no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there is social redlining. There is the use of this data to  Decide on whether or not to hire people there are real world implications  And so is it controlling your life in like a scary mind control way? No, but it is  Narrowing your choices in ways that people don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In tremendous ways you've never had before as well. You can go to link and get jobs  You've never seen more cool stuff, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and i'm aware of that but i'm unaware of the bad stuff that's happening the the punishments and I think that lack  Of awareness is really important to talk about and that's what I think  We should be having a debate about that's where we should be shining the light of transparency that we all are so excited  about  as journalists onto these platforms saying hey  Who's using your stuff? What data do you collect? What do you?  Exactly profile. This is exactly the okay. So we all agree that first question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right a little loaded second question  How is big tech using our personal information to strengthen its reach in its bottom line?  Are these companies engaging in anti-competitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information commerce?  He says this is a net neutrality issue too  Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy simple precautions not we're not asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Impossible things and finally what role if we want them to do our democracy, but okay. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What well what role should these companies play in our lives and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?  So there's two different burdens here. There's a I agree with you jeff  If you feel like technology controlling your lives the burden is on you not the technology  So there is definitely a burden on the individual  But I think that it's reasonable for us as a society through our government to ask these companies  Um, you know to be to preserve competition to protect privacy  I don't think those are unreasonable things to protect our security. Those are reasonable things to ask a company to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The same government that just today  Tried to for is trying to force time Warner to sell cnn out of spite the same government  Well, that's that's who you want to regulate the speech. That's the figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I I have covered politics forever I have dealt with the net neutrality debate, for example  over several successive fcc's including  I was going to say colin pal michael pal  But this is this is the fundamental compromise we make when we have the government in act laws we  vote in a group of people  Who feel the way we feel or the opposite of the way we feel the way politics goes now  And we have them craft laws that other people may decide to enact differently and that is the risk we take  With a democracy in the ability of the pressure we put back on is to decide what should be law and shouldn't be law

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if I was also the eu the eu I think has already gone way overboard possible and I fear that here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there but there's also the risk you have to acknowledge of a backlash  If these companies don't start to take some responsibility  Amen, that's why I press too. It could go very far in the opposite direction and all this great internet stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would not be amen. Yeah. Amen. That's exactly what's happening. I think that's what michael godwin's point is now  We've gone too far. We're gonna lose. Yeah, we're gonna lose they didn't do enough. Listen  I've been arguing that too, right? I can give you chapter and verse about how I pressured them  It would be a good thing for them to do something before  People start to say well, yeah, they should have set an entirely new standard for transparency political advertising. For example  They should go way beyond what's required of tv  They should be releasing every single political ad in a way that's searchable with an api with all of the the targeting data  They should be doing all of that. They should have done that before anybody even breathed the idea of legislation  They should have seen this coming. They weren't smart enough to same with this porn thing same with another story  We have up on the rundown that they're they're not smart enough  This is why I've argued they should hire journalists so they can just get a sense of public responsibility  I agree with all of that. They have they're messing it up. They're messing up our internet and that's why I fear  But I also think there's I need to keep pressure back on the idea of us turning into eu regulation. That scares me  worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think gdpr is is decent regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't want to get I don't want to get a gdpr. All right, let's take a break. We'll have more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  rest relax  Get a you know, just taking that stuff next like back to your coffee planes coming down and for the fights and things and  It's really you know, it's it's really an interesting time. Um  I feel like there is  There's something brewing. It's not skynet. I'm not saying it's skynet  But there's something brewing right now and the capabilities to take big tech companies  That is new unique and and can be a little worrisome don't and and I just think it can also be magnificent  It could be well and there's a lot of magnificent stuff  but in order to keep the as we said to keep the magnificent stuff flowing we've got to make sure that we  And they responsibly handle the stuff that's damn damaging  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But all I'm saying leo is that is that for those of us who are around technology and are savvier about it  It's up to us to defend the good stuff because that's not happening now  That's that's the that's that's we have we have our special responsibility to do both absolutely do both and be critical of them  And I you only spent an hour being critical. You're being I get it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so you you're pushing a little harder on the other side because  And there are plenty of people of luddites of non-technically savvy people who are pushing hard in the other direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's why I wrote public parts because I said there are plenty of protectors of privacy  I am well confident that privacy will be well represented as an issue. That's fair, but sharing is not well represented. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, I think we as usual agree it all matters of substance here  It's a matter of tone and a matter of priority and a matter of what we each fear is different. Yeah  Fair enough, but now you got to make some money because that's all you really care about leo  That's all I care about is making money  But I read ads so you guys don't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the here's the chinese wall right here between you and this following ad

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our show is brought to you today  By the way, you know, this is a big challenge for us about what should we accept ads for companies like microsoft and apple?  Uh companies that we directly cover or not. That's an interesting question, too. I mean  When we fortunately have not had to answer because microsoft and apple have never come calling our show today  Hint hint google never no our show today brought to you by  It's called this week in google you could have you could own it would you take an ad for google?  We actually the only ads we've ever taken for google and I feel good about it the summer of code  Yeah, because that's a that's a good thing and uh, i'm not sure  I think it would be very difficult for us to take pixel 2 ads for instance  I think that would be a real challenge. Well, meanwhile talking about something like a mortgage company that does it better for  In a way the technologists would love I think that's completely appropriate  I'll get to your head now. I'll stop it. Yeah. No, no, no  No, it's all part and parcel of the same thing our show is brought to you by quick and loans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, okay  If you have attention there's a setting on the face id that says do I have to pay attention or not?  And you can turn that off. It's on by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. This is more up your alley  Harmony link  We talk about that on the podcast I figured you would harmony sending out emails to owners of the harmony link  Which by the way is a cloud-based service including, you know hardware has a cloud-based back end that after march 2018  It's gonna stop working in other words if you bought a link it will be bricked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a terrible thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so i'm gonna what is what is logitech to do if it's an obsolete product? They don't they have to support it forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my thing. I've been calling for this my my celebratory like  I've been calling for this for a long time  companies need to  Create expiration dates for consumer products  If it's a software-based product you need to say and this is happening in the enterprise

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft's always done this when they when they put out a version of windows. There's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so does google so does apple so now when you're you know, this solves a lot of the problems because consumers can say  Oh, I don't want to buy this because it's only got a five-year lifespan  So that that's my take kevin has another take but I don't remember what my take is don't buy anything that requires a cloud service

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes  Or if you do make sure you can  Subplant it and keep it running if you want to keep using it  Also a good option  Here's one we could just do the headline and move on gretta van susteren is launching an app called sorry  And I think that's fair for what huh everything  Uh, it's actually uh, you you will get to accept or reject apologies from a friend  or  From a public figure if it's a public figure figure we all get to see and vote on accept or reject  So my god, it's like hot or not for public shame. Yeah, so kathy griffin she gives as an example  On her facebook page credit us  As an example kathy griffin remember she uh, she picture of her with a chopped off head of donald trump. She could apologize on sorry  Was it enough or not?  People would vote how would she know if her apology was accepted without the vote counter asks gretta  Or how about when a cable news network apologizes for a blunder a poll politician for cheating on a spouse doves soap for that  commercial  It's just endless says gretta van susteren  Everybody's got an app  I think this is this is an app for the times. Sorry the sorry app  Let's take a break picks of the week coming up and i'm going to start with talking about the lighthouse  Which I know stacy you've you you told me I was a dork for not buying  So I went out and bought one and I love it lighthouse is the only security camera  That has a lidar in it  You might say well, what the heck it's it's not lighter. Well, it's lidar like right? What is it? It is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time of light sensor. All right, sorry time of flight sensor time of flight

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sensor  Uh, it doesn't spin around like the lidar on top of a google car  It's right here  But what it does do is it makes a 3d map of everything out there and that allows it  This is a security camera. It's got infrared light so it can see in the dark  It allows it to know what's out there people pets it can distinguish between the two  It knows when you're there when family members are there strangers are there  and  If you could set it's got artificial intelligence built into it  So you could say let me know if my daughter doesn't come home by three  Let me know if you see any pictures of my pets  Uh, it continually analyzes the 3d map of the room to detect movement  To know what's in the map. I remember I had another brand of security camera  Which constantly told me that the that the mylar balloons in the corner were people invading my house  The lighthouse does not get fooled by mylar balloons. And what's really cool is it will notify you on your phone  They there's somebody I don't recognize in your house show you a picture  And then right below it it says call you have a button to call 911  Turn off security or just ignore it. I love this thing light dot house  slash twit  Is so smart and I love the uh, the ai  See, so okay here. I'll give you an example. Look right now somebody just walked through  Our house, okay  And it it pinged me alert triggered in the living room  All okay call 911. I could decide how I want to handle that  It recognizes people  So here's all the pictures of me that it's seen and if it sees some things that look like me is this you?  I can say yeah, that's me. That's me. That's me. That's me. That's me  That's not me. That's not me  So that those are all me  So I can say those those are all leo laporte confirmed six images so i'm training it  It really is cool 1080p live stream two-way talk. Oh, I didn't mention that you can talk to people  In fact, there's this great thing. It will ping you if somebody stands in front of the camera waves  Somebody's waving so when your kids get home they can wave and you go. Yeah. Oh, hi. You're home. Yeah, i'm home from school  Okay. Thanks for letting me know  It's got three different permission settings. So you've got owner member and um  Can't remember what the third one is  I should look at it. So you can say look  I'm the primary owner but lisa is a member and don't bother and oh and this is very important for lisa  She doesn't like the idea of cameras being on when we're walking around in the house  She doesn't want to see people to see her in her jammies or whatever or just want to put it on the internet  So whenever we're home cameras off we're home. It's secure. We don't have to worry about it  I can go on and on this is so cool  You can say what do the kids do while I was out yesterday? You can get a timeline. It'll play back video  A video timeline. Look at this leo laporte left leo laporte arrived. I know exactly what time I got home  What time I this is incredible. I can say when it pings me  Uh, I could say, you know, uh, are there children in the house?  I can't say how old are they old or what so i'm gonna leave uh,  I'm gonna leave security alerts on but i'm gonna say it's all okay  I can get a recap of all the pet activity in the house or all the people activity in the house  This is so cool  Um, I I can go on and on this is the smartest  Home security camera I have ever seen I love the ai built into it  I love the 3d sensor the time of flight sensor built into it  Um, and and it's not available  So thank you everybody. Good night. No  Pre-orders were sold out. It was it went out like crazy  But they're gonna they're making them as fast as they can  And they're gonna ship a new batch very soon and I want you to get in there and get it  light dot house slash twit  You'll get 15 off the lighthouse when it ships and by the way a chance to win your own lighthouse plus a year of service free  That's a 399 value lighthouse  Is at light dot house  Slash twit put your email address in there and they'll notify you the minute they're ready to go and I think it's going to be soon  And you'll get 15 off as well  This thing is so cool. We have we this is our studio one. I have them all over everywhere now  Because it's just it's much smarter and it it doesn't ping me  when um  When it's not a problem and and best of all unlike any of these are cameras when we're home  There's cameras off. I like that light that house slash twit  See site for contest rules and of course 15 off lighthouse when they ship now  What's stacey's thing the world wants to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, you know how we were talking about security earlier. Yeah, we were  It was it was a thing. Oh, I never I haven't I haven't unwrapped my see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I prefer something like lighthouse to a monitoring service. I want to monitor it and then I can decide what's going on, right?  I like that better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so what I have here and  Is this is this is very diy very nerdy. So  Be advised and don't I am touching the boards just ignore me  So this is from a company called connect with a k. Sorry. It looks like a raspberry pie or something  What is it is? It's it's a little board connected is the name of it and what it does is it connects in with your wired security?  system  so what this does is that you connect the wires in through here and  You put them in and then it will take all the sensors that are wired into your house and your existing old school security system  and  You can now integrate them with smart things  And  It's pretty cool for a certain class of people who is not like this is not something your grandma

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this doesn't use and this is that thing where if you're buying a cloud service and they discontinue it you're out of luck  This you you you own this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You own this um, and you have an app that it will connect to on your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you gonna do use open source software with it or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is an app  It is open source. Oh nice  Um now I have not installed this because I thought I had a wired security system and it turns out I don't  I have wireless. I was like, oh  So I have not seen this working  Well, look, here's the brains  So basically all this works together it is a solution for a problem that some people will have  and it is  Probably a nice one. I just need to find a home to install it in and see  So my hope was to actually tell you  Hey  This is amazing or this sucks. Well, you will we'll hear about it  What is the website for connect? Oh, it is con. Oh, it is pre-launched.connectedwithak.io  Connectedwithak.io

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

This is and this is this by the way i'm gonna argue  The internet has a role in this  The fact that we have gay marriage in this country  Which I consider a good is because people suddenly realized that people could come out and you can recognize that you have someone in your family  And they're they're not awful and evil and other they're people  They're people same now for trans we have this whole thing going on about trans and bathrooms and all this  Hu ha but the internet enables people to stand up and say  Uh, i'm one you got a problem with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You go back to gay marriage and I think you could say that that same thing happened that kind of cultural shift  Happened and it happened so fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
