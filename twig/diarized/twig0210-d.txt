Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a little bit of stuff happened  since we were here last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a new toy on your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a new phone.  So do you.  I see your HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like new.  HTC One just got Android 4.3, so soon was soon.  Impressed, impressed.  Happy with it.  Happy with it.  I'm trying to remember what I should be looking for on 4.3.  Some camera changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's profiles, which is a big thing.  There's profiles.  Yep, yep.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of the camera settings were a little different.  Yeah, I'm poking around.  I'm very happy.  Very happy that that update came down,  because I didn't want to have to wait very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it prompted me, because the HTC Sense is still  at 4.2.2, and will be probably for a while.  It takes a while to update that stuff.  The Google Experience phone, which  is what you have got updated.  So I put the Google Experience ROM on my stock HTC One.  Because I wanted 4.3.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're coming back into the kind of pure experience fold.  You're feeling the pure experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before the show, I was arguing against Google Experience HTC  One because of the Zoe's and the highlights  and some sense-specific stuff.  But I'm kind of getting, after using the Moto X for a little  while, I'm getting burned.  Like, I gave up on the Galaxy S4,  because it's so junked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tried to work with a friend's phone,  and in 10 minutes, it drove me nutty.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then I did the same thing to the two.  This is normally an AT&T HTC One,  but I put, you know, you can get the Google Experience ROM  on it.  And they can get 4.3 Google Experience ROM.  The ROM guys are fast.  They waste no time.  And you know what?  I like it.  I like it.  But it all started with the Moto X.  I finally got one.  Of course, the big announcement was,  the reveal was on Wednesday, and I got mine on Friday.  I've been playing with it.  And you know, it's not perfect.  I told Gina cryptically that she should wait,  because I know you liked the Nexus 4.  And you, Jeff, still use the Nexus 4, right?  Mm-hmm.  I do.  Yeah.  And I felt like this was, in many ways,  a spiritual successor to the Nexus 4.  It's certainly in form factor.  It feels the same.  It's roughly the same dots per inch.  It's a 4.7-inch screen.  It's a few dots per inch less, but it's 720p.  But it looks very good.  It's an AMOLED screen, but not Pentile.  One of the reasons I didn't like the Nexus 4  is I wasn't crazy about the color  banning I would see in the Pentile display.  By the way, I have a phony launcher on here.  I have Nova Launcher, so it doesn't look  like a Google Experience.  And I've added a lot of apps.  But if you go back to the way it came out of the box,  there's only two pages of apps.  There's only two AT&T apps on here, My AT&T and the AT&T  of Visual Voicemail.  There's a couple of Motorola apps,  both of which I think are good.  They're not clutter.  So it's about as close.  The Nexus 4 was not a Pentile screen.  It was IPS.  Oh, sorry.  I apologize.  I thought it was for some reason.  So this is AMOLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I had the Galaxy.  And I also had the Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Galaxy Nexus.  That was the Pentile.  OK.  Yep.  So I think you'd like this screen.  You're used to an OLED screen.  Some people don't like OLED.  It's the same resolution as the screen, roughly  as the screen you had.  It's the same feeling.  It's sealed.  There's no removable battery, no SD card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's shipped with the default Android launcher,  right?  There was no new skin.  In fact, I could go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I should go back to it because I'm  giving you a false impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I was curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put Nova Launcher on every phone eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's your home.  That's my default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'll go back to the Android launcher.  This is the pure Android experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Motorola features, the camera twisting, launching  thing, and some of the breathing in and out,  the listening, the Google Now always listening.  Are those Motorola apps that are in your app drawer?  Are those just sort of running?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're in your app drawer.  There's a part of your app drawer that's downloaded.  Here, I'll show you the app drawer.  And then there's the stuff that came on it.  A lot of it's called com.Motorola.something.  It's that kind of an app.  It's an invisible app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so it's a process.  It's a process.  Running in the back.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you put another mod on this phone,  would you lose those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, you would.  Right.  Unless that mod included it.  So as far as I know, and I'm going  to give you the best information I have.  And I may be wrong on some of this stuff.  But as far as I know, the way it knows about the camera, which  is the wrist flick, which launches the camera,  the way it knows that is there's a demon running  that watches the accelerator.  So that's just a software demon.  The way it always on listening is a little different.  That is taking advantage of hardware feature,  this X8 processor set.  Two of the X8 processors are DSPs, one of which, I understand,  is dedicated to listening.  And it's listening for just one thing.  So when you first get the phone, I can actually go through it.  You train it.  Here's the touchless control.  And you can train the launch phrase.  It'll do this out of the box.  So I'm going to do it right now.  OK, Google Now.  OK, Google Now.  OK, Google Now.  OK, Google Now.  So you have to do it in a quiet room.  You do it three times.  And now it's trained it with my voice.  So that's how it gives the voice distinctive listening.  Because it's my voice, if you go, OK, Google Now,  it won't respond.  You have to say it in your own voice.  OK, Google Now.  And somewhat like, frankly, you said it on the training.  So it's just like if you've ever used like drag and dictate,  when you first train it, it's like that.  You're repeating the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens if you have laryngitis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, for instance, the other day I trained it,  I was in bed lying down.  And it never worked again.  So I had to retrain it.  It wasn't like the supine wheel.  Right.  I was probably sad like this.  So you can train it again.  I just trained it again.  I trained it with a droopy dog voice, as you know, on Twitter.  And it worked.  So you can train it with an oddball voice if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very responsive, like seeing you flip your wrist  and saying how it came up and said good afternoon.  So the wrist flip thing, do you have to shake it?  Is it just one flip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's three.  It's like this, one, two, three.  And then it's very quick.  And the other thing that makes it fast for photography  is it's tap to focus and shoot.  So you tap what you want to take a picture of, and it does it.  I know what I'm going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to fly out of my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a Nintendo remote.  You know, some people complain about this.  It's not a hard gesture to get used to.  It's pretty, you know, it works.  Once you use it for a while, it works 100% of the time.  And it's not like a, there, it didn't work, of course.  It's not like you have to dislocate your wrist  to have it to work.  But I like that so much so that I actually  took the camera icon off of the dock  because I don't think I'll ever watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the way you launch the camera.  So if the phone is locked and you do the gesture,  does it give you?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  In fact, it's so stock that it's got the standard Android  stock lock screen that you can swipe.  If you swipe right, you'll get the camera.  You swipe left, you can have widgets.  It's very stock feeling.  The differences are the camera app.  Unaccountably, the calendar app is the older Google Calendar,  not the one with the nice new picker.  But you just download the new Google Calendar.  It's the Google keyboard.  If you played with it, you'd say this is pretty much  the same as a Google Edition phone, which  explains why Motorola, at least Guy Kawasaki,  told me that they don't plan to do a Google Edition  version of this.  That they'll sell it on the Play Store,  but they'll sell it like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're going to sell it.  And here's my only issue.  I'm going to get one.  But, and there was disappointment about the phone  and overhype and this and that.  I'm all right with it now.  But my problem is that it's the carrier crap.  It's the carrier deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They will sell an unlocked version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  But then they'll only sell it in 16, not 32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right now, that's true.  Right now, AT&T has a lock on 32 and has a lock on Moto Maker,  the customization site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what gets me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not going to, I don't, well, I mean,  you're probably going to run, as I will buy it right away.  I'll buy it right away.  So you'll have to go AT&T if you want that.  But I don't think in the long run you'll have to do that.  I think, in fact, I get the strong impression  that the exclusive is not for very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  But here's the issue.  Google says that they put the customer first, always  customer first.  And when Google does that, they do that most of the time,  Google wins.  It's every time that Google puts the industry first  that we lose, right?  Net neutrality in Verizon, China, servers on your home server  and Google Fiber, crap deals with carriers.  That's when Google loses.  When Google doesn't follow its own rule, then,  and we expect more of it, right?  I don't expect the same thing of the old Motorola.  But now that it's Google, I expect that of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I'm totally with you.  I don't think you need a 32 gig, though, Jeff.  This doesn't respond to that absolutely accurate  observation.  Google should be looking out for the customers first,  not the carriers.  But it comes with 12 gig, almost 12 gigs free on the 16 gig.  And I've barely filled it.  I mean, unless you're going to.  I've filled up my phone.  Yeah, but that's kind of an old usage model  where you put a lot of media on it.  Well, I do because of the airplane.  Yeah, I mean, you can get an airplane  worth of music on there easily in a few gigs.  You don't need eight gigs of music for a four hour flight  or five hour flight or even a 20 hour flight.  I don't know.  I noticed that I no longer fill up phones  because I'm not putting media on there as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is.  Yeah, I don't run into these problems either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what this, to me, there was a lot of overhype.  And I unfortunately contributed to that  by not being able to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it turns out to be a brilliant strategy on their part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brilliant.  I'm never doing that again.  I know.  But because the because, you know, people projected onto that,  oh, it must be the greatest phone ever.  Yeah.  And that wasn't what was going through my head.  I was it was the more mixed reaction of there's some things  I love about this.  This is a huge step forward.  Remember what this is Motorola folks were talking about.  This is a huge step forward from Droid.  Although the new Droid phones have that always listening  because they're using the X8 chipset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And they kind of scooped the X a little bit on that announcement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like how this was how the X seems  like the opposite of the Samsung GS4 launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Walk through of all these different apps.  I mean, on one hand, it's like, OK, you know,  Samsung's taken a crack at becoming a great app maker.  Right.  But I like that Moto X is so stripped down  with a few kind of extras, a couple of things I still want  to see in stock Android that that's happening anywhere.  And if you find her to take a photo, a fast burst mode  in the camera, that should be in the stock camera app.  I mean, I feel like the stock Android camera app is so ripe  for so many improvements.  I don't I mean, the very few improvements they made in 4.3  just aren't enough.  There's a lot more that can be done there.  But of course, you have the special hardware,  which is the point you're making in the pre-show, Leo, right?  They've got that special hardware on the Moto X  where you can do the things like that, the always listening  and the accelerometer and the breathing thing.  It's kind of like the Google Glass phone, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people have said that, I guess.  I mean, not having glass, I'm not sure, but that's what Skobel argues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's so used to voice commands.  Like glass knows when it's on your head and glass knows  which way your head is turned.  Like there's there's the glasses always listening.  Well, actually, that's not true, is it?  Well, it knows, you know, when you tap the glass.  Yeah, when you have the tap glass to initiate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing that may not be clear for people,  the Google now doesn't do anything different on this.  The only difference is it's always listening.  All the commands are the same.  So, for instance, on my HTC One, I've set up  Nova Launcher that when I just stroke it up, it launches the always listening.  That's the same.  And now I'm going to have exactly the same experience  as I have on the on the Moto X.  Yeah.  So all of these is, oh, I mean, it's not.  So you have to touch the phone.  The only difference is you don't have to touch the phone.  And if you lock it, by the way, all of that's all that's off,  because now you have to unlock the phone.  I mean, if you know you have a pattern or a password,  you have to unlock it before the always listening goes on.  There is one exception, and I think some people missed the boat on this one.  I thought Joshua Topolski, most of the reviews I've read have been pretty right on.  Joshua Topolski said, you know, you got to try this phone  to really understand what it is that's so cool about it.  He missed one thing.  He didn't mention the fact that when you're in within,  you could set it up within interested Bluetooth range.  First, when I get my car that it unlocks.  So as long as I'm my car, it's unlocked and always listening.  So when you get out of the car, it locks again.  So the place is where you want to talk to it.  You can set it up very easily to talk if you've got Bluetooth in the car, I guess.  And the other thing was that  they showed us but decided not to release.  I hear they're going to continue.  They are going to do it at some point.  A little clip that had a magnet in it to wake up the phone and an NFC to unlock it  so that you could swipe.  You could have the clip on your clothes and swipe it that way.  You could have it in your car and start track.  How Star Trek can you get?  Yeah, I'm not sure why they didn't release it with the release of the phone.  They were showing us that.  And I liked that as well.  And you could buy multiple NFC clips.  So you could have it do some of this.  Make it more so it's aware of where you are.  I wish it were doing it with Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth,  because then it would unlock.  And I thought that they had told us it would be Wi-Fi.  I think there's stuff in here that they haven't quite turned on yet.  But the idea that you get in the house, you're within trusted Wi-Fi range.  OK, I'll unlock.  You get in the car, you're within trusted Bluetooth range.  OK, I'll unlock.  Then you can keep it locked, which you should.  Every phone, you should keep locked.  I think. But you could also  use the always on voice commands.  Yeah, that's nice.  I just think this motor and it's made in America.  I think, you know, gosh, we talk so much about  why does an Apple on this show, why doesn't Apple make stuff in America?  What would the additional cost be?  Finally, a company, American company, Motorola, does assemble a phone in America.  And it's just, you know, nobody there.  Everybody says, oh, it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That didn't get picked up very much.  No, the party created two thousand jobs in Fort Worth.  Yeah, yeah. So it's assembled in Texas, right?  And the parts are from overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of the parts, but but yeah, better than the other companies done.  Nobody's making the the rare earth, you know,  pieces, the stuff that's being Samsung's make.  Nobody's making these chips in the US.  Now, if somebody starts making these chips in the US, then they can be all US.  But, you know, no car is all US.  Nothing that's made and assembled in the US is 100 percent US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that whole movement bothers me a bit.  And you know, you have to buy your strawberries in the US.  Well, what about the poor Chilean strawberry farmer?  He needs a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's good reasons to buy local food  because you don't have to ship it.  It's environmentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's well, no, no, there's if you go to the free economics guys,  and there's a lot of arguments to the contrary.  It's become can't religion.  But but, you know, we're in a worldwide economy,  and I don't think it's awful to help jobs around the world. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think assembled in America is good.  And I think it's an American phone company.  And I'm happy about that.  And I think they deserve some credit for that. Right. Yeah.  And that may be part of the reasons a little more expensive,  although now I've seen stories that the carriers,  one analyst said the carriers are probably paying about three hundred  fifty dollars for this phone,  which means that they're making some good money on the two hundred dollar subsidy.  And in fact, could charge less and may well charge less.  You might see the phone drop in price pretty quickly.  But that was one of the complaints to hey, it's a mid range,  mid range specs for a full price phone, same as a GS for the HTC one.  And, you know, first of all, I don't think it's mid mid range specs.  I think it's a pretty impressive specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that processor is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't feel believe me.  You know, it's easy to judge a phone until you've held it and used it, then judge it.  You know, it's easy to say, oh, but it's not slow.  And the screen looks great.  I don't see any negatives to the way they've designed this.  They got I would have loved, for instance, wireless charging doesn't have that  like the Nexus four did.  But there's no room. They try to put more battery in here.  They're doing, you know, that that battery thing where the batteries here  and the and the and the motherboard is right against the screen.  And they've got a they've designed a curved battery.  So they can maximize the battery volume.  There was no room for a cheap charger, I guess.  So that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the the new LG phone has a three thousand.  Right. It needs it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know why? It's got a it's got a five point two inch 1080p screen.  So that's the other reason for 720p is, you know, the battery life on this is great.  It's 18 hours. I just rock solid 18 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG says 21 more than 24.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because they got a giant battery in it. Yeah.  Well, this says 24 to write.  So I was going to say that says 24. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you got 18. I just saw Brian Klug from a non tech saying  I get about 12, no matter how hard it tries.  I don't know. Oh, no, no. I'm pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, let's look right now.  I'm pretty consistently getting 18 hours.  And, you know, it's a new phone, which means you use it more than you would.  You know, later on down the road, I use it like crazy.  So it's 74 percent.  It's been off battery for three hours.  Little. So that's 12 hours.  If you just multiply by four.  But but of this 68 percent screen time, I've got an hour and a half on screen.  That's the big battery drain is the screen type.  So, you know, in normal reasonable use, it's been it's been 16, 18 hours.  Really consistent. And that's all I require.  I want 16 hours because that means I sleep for eight hours.  I get up, I unplug it and I can go to I go back to bed.  Yeah, that's what I want.  16 hours is what I want.  And I get that consistently on this.  The always listening does not hurt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got the GS for the one and the Moto X.  What's your primary phone right now?  It sounds like it's the X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has been the X, although I really like the HTC one.  The Galaxy S4 I lent to IAS because I can no longer use it.  It's got, you know, what is your phone?  You cannot go. Well, I can.  It's a locked bootloader and a triangle away is not available yet on the GS four.  So I'm kind of stuck. I can't modify the firmware.  I did root it, but I can't modify the firmware yet.  I'm you know, this is a big change for me.  I'm coming to becoming a fan of the Google experience.  When I talked to a rich what's his name overhaul from  Motorola, who was the guy who did the demos for everybody,  he he says, I'm the guy who invented blur.  And he said we had to because it was Android.  Gingerbread was not good enough.  I would also argue that care that phone manufacturers did that  just to make one version of Android different from the other.  So they have a distinctive version.  Yeah. But he said and he said he felt quite comfortable  shipping a almost pure Android experience because it's come such a long way.  And I'd agree with him.  Four point two, two and even more four three, three is a very mature.  Oh, yes, I think it's it's very, very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you imagine how much explaining he had to do when Google bought them?  Yeah, yeah, I invented it, but really, really, I think it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He left. He left for a while and then came back.  I can't remember the story, but I think he came back when during  after the acquisition.  Oh, but yeah, I can't remember the story.  I you know, I think that this isn't the best phone in the world.  There is no perfect phone.  There really isn't a perfect phone.  I think it's a very good phone, and I think it will particularly appeal  to the people leaving the iPhone.  I think that's really what Motorola is trying to do.  This is this is the it's not an iPhone killer,  but if you're moving to Android from an iPhone,  this is certainly the one you should get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, says I don't care about anybody else in the world, only me.  Going from the Nexus four to this. Easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, not having used that's why I bought a Nexus four,  because then I got I got curious.  I said, well, maybe so I bought a Nexus four, which comes Friday.  So I can't answer that because I I feel like from what I know  about the Nexus four and I played with one a lot of people around here have them.  Yeah, but I didn't use it for any length of time.  I feel like this is the logical successor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, on AT&T, it's not LTE on T-Mobile.  You can turn on the LTE, though it doesn't have another radio for that  or some repeaters. The Nexus four does. Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. Yeah. And this will be LTE on AT&T.  It's fast, too. It also supports 802 to 11 AC.  And I was getting 50 megabit  downloads and 20 megabit uploads off of my AC router at home.  It was very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Gina, any buyer's remorse doesn't sound like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm OK. I'm good.  I mean, I'm curious about the X.  I would like to hold it and try it.  But no, I like my one.  And there's there's the X sounds really sounds cool.  There's a couple of nice features there.  I like to it sounds like it is sort of the spirit of success for the Nexus four.  Maybe that's what the X stands for the next Nexus.  But I'm happy. I like I like the one a lot, especially now that it has four three  and it fixed that one.  There's one bug with Google Play movies, which is fixed now.  I really like the speakers on the front of the design of it.  I don't mind swiping up for Google now.  So you always listening is, you know, not a big deal for me.  I am I'm pretty good.  I'm not I'm not too bad.  Not as bad as it could have been.  I was worried Leo had me. I had you worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the speakers alone, if you use the speakers,  that's enough reason to stay with the one because the speaker on this is loud.  But it's tinny. It's not a great speaker.  Yeah. So the one really there's nothing better in terms if you use it.  Now, a lot of people say, who uses the speakers in their phone?  I use headphones or I put in a speaker.  But if you use the speakers in your phone, then absolutely.  There's no the one is a killer.  And yes, you do.  You can see the difference in the screens.  The one screen is pretty incredible.  I mean, it's more than 400 dots per inch.  And while they say you can't tell the difference,  there's something you feel about it that you can tell.  You know, I don't know what it is, but they're just now notice they're equally fluid.  There's not any hesitation or lag on either of them.  I think performance is good on both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one a little taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The screen's the same size, but the physical because of because of the speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when I installed my app, I could see a whole other task like it was.  It was like, oh, yeah, I can I can I notice that the the space,  you know, the port was so much bigger because I see more content.  Of course, I saw it, you know, instantaneously in my own app.  So I look at it so much. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, from a pure aesthetic point of view,  probably the one is hardware wise and is absolutely superior.  It is. There's no question.  It's a phone. Yeah.  Now, I asked Guy if he can get me the wood back one,  and that might change my perception of the Moto X.  They're going to make it.  They're going to make it with teak, ebony, walnut, different wooden backs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it.  Like I just I'm not.  It's like a woody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, you know, the car woody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she doesn't know what you mean, Leo.  You know, country squire, you know, she doesn't know what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to have to talk about their their ad marketing.  They're they're. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, because they were they were they did some sexy ads for the X,  which they pulled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know.  And they said we've got wood.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. On their Twitter.  And they pulled it. They pulled it within like an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They realize it really wasn't quite.  Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's skeuomorphism.  We know actual wood.  Now, what is a nice material?  I really like wood, and I think it would be kind of an interesting material  for a phone.  This what does what is true about this is it's smaller and it feels good.  And there it is.  Guy had a wood back.  It feels good in the hand.  Look at that. Is that not beautiful?  So there's four different colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The darker the darker wood is actually you get T doesn't look so crazy.  Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And ebony, which is black.  If this phone is this phone and it's something that you don't know  from the specs or from reading that it feels good in the hand,  it's the right size, it's the right texture.  I'm not going to want to put a case on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like that.  They said that they focused on the user experience and not on specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, rightly so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I thought that was the right.  It was a good that was the right approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, rightly so.  And you make a little sacrifice for better battery life,  like the lower quality screen.  But, you know, no, no, I like cheap charging.  I wish everything had a wireless charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, everything should have wireless charging at this point.  I feel like any new phone that ships right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought pads. I bought cheap pads for everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just set it down.  Let's do its thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got one upstairs, downstairs in my house, got one in my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's barbaric finding outlets, plugging things in, looking for adapters.  It's barbaric.  How medieval.  It is. It's medieval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess if you ask the question, I wouldn't get a Galaxy S4  just because maybe the Google edition is OK.  Although it's very plasticky feeling.  I would get an HTC One or a Moto X.  You got and I would try the Moto.  I would go to a store and try the Moto X, see how it feels,  because I think that that's hard to.  Now we still have an iPhone 5 coming in the fall, probably.  The G2 doesn't from LG.  I'm not that looked like they're trying to be a Galaxy S4.  To me, they went the wrong way.  They customized it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nexus 5, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if there's a Nexus 5.  What is the point of the Nexus program?  There's twofold one to show phone manufacturers how to do it, right?  Well, this does that the Moto X does that reference phone.  Yeah. The other is to make a cheap phone for developers,  which is still the Nexus 4.  And I see no reason to replace that if you're a developer.  It still does the job right, Gina?  Mm hmm. It's got four three on it. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any of the next of the Galaxy Nexus gets got four three as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think that they have a developer, a cheap developer phone.  I don't think they need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sold four things on eBay.  My gadget fund is back up.  I'm ready to buy the LTE Nexus 7, but I don't know when I'm ready  to buy the play edition of the Moto X.  I don't know when I've got.  I'm I'm I'm my consumerism is going nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just burn a hole in your pocket.  I just buy it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I solved that to me.  The psychological angst is worse than the money.  I just throw money at them because I don't want to have the angst.  You got angst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm ready to buy.  Oh, you're right. I don't know when.  You know what? Google, can't you just tell us when the LTE  next available? Just soon.  I think next couple of weeks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love the Nexus 7. Shush.  You'll love it. No, you'll love it.  I know. I know. We can't wait to get it.  You'll be happy. You'll be happy.  Let's take a break and we're going to come back with a changelog.  How about that? Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds good. All righty.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the changelog.  And here she is.  There we go.  I wasn't going to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's that was going too fast for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blink, it was over a backwards changelog.  Gina Chirpani with what's new at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of a thin changelog today.  We've got a few items.  Google launches real time, real time API for analytics.  This is an invite only beta at the moment and mostly applies to web publishers.  But I thought it was really kind of cool.  Once you've access to this real time API, you can make queries about your data,  what's going on in your site in real time.  So you could do something very basic like, you know, a visitor,  a live visitor counter to your site, or you could have an app, you know,  notify you on your Pebble watch if you've got, you know, a peak visitors, for example.  Or, you know, if you're getting a ton of traffic from, say, Reddit or, you know,  I don't know, Dig, you could dynamically add a Reddit button or a dig button,  you know, to your site when you see that that traffic.  So kind of kind of cool stuff for web publishers who are who are.  Yeah. Expanding their audience.  Google Search has added a new feature on Google.com in US English,  and this is in-depth articles.  So Google's research showed that 10 percent of searchers are looking for kind of long  form in-depth information about big topics like, you know, I don't know, gender or censorship.  Or one of their examples, Lego, which I appreciated.  So if you if you do a search for Lego or gender or censorship, you'll get a section of in-depth  articles, which I guess Google has editors there picking these out in the side,  the main column of the search results kind of scroll down the page.  And they're, you know, long articles from reputable sources that kind of do deep dives into the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, we just try to they can't have editors doing all that.  They must do it by my brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's got to be some sort of algorithmic thing going on here.  Let's see if they say in the blog post, they've got humans doing this.  It doesn't make sense that they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Otherwise, it doesn't scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't scale.  Exactly.  TechCrunch did a post on this.  Not clear how Google will determine that article is in-depth, but, yeah, ranked algorithmically based on many.  I think it's some question. Yeah, it's the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the length. It's citations.  Probably the easy ones to start off with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it sounds like publishers can mark up their pages, optimize the markup on their pages to get accepted into this program.  So publishers should ensure their articles follow general guidelines, including pagination markup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look who they got, the Smithsonian.  They got Businessweek. They got the New York Times.  Yeah, I don't think.  I don't know if we're going to have a shot at that.  We ought to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still pissed that I'm not even in Google News because they still won't do single author blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the same thing, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really?  They want to single?  Google News has weird requirements.  It also requires you have, or at least at one point it required that every URL has some sort of alphanumeric, like unique alphanumeric string in it.  This is we were trying to get Lifehacker in forever.  And I think finally we did get in, but they had some weird requirements.  I didn't know that about single author blogs.  That doesn't make sense.  Finally, Google launches a city experts program to encourage higher quality Google Plus local reviews.  So if you want to earn yourself, get yourself some Google swag, get writing your reviews.  So this is limited to cities in the US, select cities in the US, UK, Australia and Japan.  And it rewards users who have left at least 50 reviews to date and who produce at least five new reviews each month.  So you've got to be a really active Google Plus local reviewer in order to qualify for this program.  But those users who do this meet these guidelines.  They get perks like access to local events and custom swag.  So basically Google branded stuff and special online recognition.  So Google's Google city experts again, human interaction here, human human intervention, but but volunteer users.  This is user generated content.  It's interesting.  And that you check it out at Google dot com slash local slash contest slash city expert.  That's all I got today. Pretty short change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Play the change log trumpets or timpanies.  You're something.  There you go.  The drums.  The drums.  Thank you, Gina Trippene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.  I want to talk about this this chrome story, this chrome passion story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is kind of we talked about it on security now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're over it.  You're like that's so you're like I haven't talked about the Moto X in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no, no, I'm I wasn't sure what to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's better informed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm better informed.  Definitely are.  So let me just show you what it is.  If you're using Chrome and everybody knows this.  I don't know why this is suddenly a story, except it must be this slow season.  But when you go into your Chrome settings, I will not log into Google just so that you show  see what it looks like, whether you're logged in or not.  When you go to your Chrome settings and you scroll down to the bottom and show advanced settings.  By the way, Firefox and other browsers do this as well.  You'll see a password and forms.  Let me make it bigger so you can see a password and forms section.  There's offer to save passwords I enter on the Web.  And then there's a button that says manage saved passwords.  So if you let by the way, if you're worried about this, uncheck that box.  But if you let Chrome save your passwords, then when you go into manage saved passwords,  you'll see dots next to the passwords.  You can show this. I don't I don't think this is anything important.  Oh, I meant this is a Motorola connect launching on this.  It's a it's a Chrome extension that lets the Moto X text messages I could send and receive  from Moto X. Kind of like Mighty Text.  It's kind of like a branded Mighty Text.  So let me go back to the settings. Pulled me out for a moment.  Back down to advanced. Back down to.  Passwords and forms, manage saved passwords.  You'll see the passwords, you'll see the dots.  You can show this. And then when I click the dot, there's a show button  that shows what the password is and it shows it in clear text.  So the verge and others of Twitter went crazy.  Oh, my God. But you have to understand that this requires that somebody have physical  access to your computer and that you're logged in onto that computer and that you've been  using Chrome to save the password.  Same thing happens with other browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your email window is probably already open on the computer with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If somebody has physical access to your computer, you have far bigger problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so I see that.  And that was Google's justification, right?  They said Google said so.  So first, Firefox does this by default, but it has a password.  Like you can set a master password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember that was a big security reveal some time ago was and it was worse when Firefox  because they stored the passwords in the clear unless you use that password.  So everybody turned that on, I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right. So you could turn that on, but Chrome has not done that.  And their reasoning was and tell me if I get this wrong, but they said that that master  password is doesn't doesn't help.  And we don't want to give users a false sense of security that their that their passwords  are actually safe using that master password.  The reality is that somebody has your access to your computer.  Then you're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're screwed because the browser has to be able to send the password to a site when  you log in. So that password has to be available to the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So don't just leave your machine on and logged in everywhere and think you're by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here's Safari.  And you'll notice that I'm in the same kind of section of Safari, all the saved passwords  and there's a show passwords button.  Now, Safari does the same thing Firefox does.  When I click show passwords, it says you have to log into your account again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's a keychain prompt, isn't it?  Is that a keychain prompt or OK, so that's all right.  Well, that's something.  Yeah, I'm surprised that there's no I just gotta tell you, it sounds kind of flimsy to  me because Chrome doesn't just run on our computers.  I mean, it also runs on our phones.  Is that how it's going to work on our phones as well?  So like if someone has your PIN code, I don't know.  I don't save my passwords in Chrome.  I use LastPass and you need a master password in order to get into LastPass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that I think is what Google's saying is if you're saving passwords in the browser,  it's inherently risky.  So you should be saving it.  Use LastPass or turn off browser saving, which I always do, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, with LastPass, if I've got Chrome open and I've authenticated with LastPass  and the tool bar is there and I walk away from my computer, then anybody can get into  LastPass. I have to close the browser or log out of LastPass.  And I'm not sure how my LastPass settings are, but I think you can set how often.  Yes, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can make it authenticate every time if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I just feel like this is like the, you know, roommates, siblings shared.  It just it just seems like there's so many opportunities in which someone could could  so easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you understand that they also have access to your email.  They also have access to your hard drive.  I mean, they've got right.  They've got everything.  Right. You know, they've got they're physically.  So if you log out of your computer, for instance, and you don't this,  but this just reminds people you should have a password on your computer.  You should have it log out when, you know, the screensaver comes on or you walk away  from it. You shouldn't, you know, have it automatically log in.  If somebody has physical access to your computer, you're at risk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just it just seems strange that Google wouldn't have added on, hey, log in, hey,  just log in with your Google account to show us that who you are.  Like just just let's just make sure that you are who you say you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, that's the crux of the debate.  You're saying why not just add an extra layer and let people do it?  And Google saying that it leads to bad habits.  And I'm not sure where I come out on that.  Well, let me think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're both that would require if you do that, that means that you would have to  have a Google account to have Chrome safe passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's oh, don't you?  Don't you? You least have to have a Chrome profile.  You least have to have you don't have to have a Google account to use Chrome and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have it save passwords now.  Oh, really? Oh.  I don't think the passwords are tied to your Chrome to your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you see that mine's because you can see that mine are because mine goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  across machines, if you turn on syncing, but that's because you've turned on  syncing. Yes.  So now you're turning on syncing and you're authenticating with a password,  which can be your Google password or not, by the way.  It could be it could be anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right. So I'm just like if Safari prompts you with Keychain and Firefox  gives you at least the option to set a master password, it just surprises me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that Google Safari's doing the right thing, but that's because it's written by  Apple. Right.  So it's using it's using the fact that it knows it's going to be on Apple to  store the passwords in an Apple OS provided safe store secure store, the  keychain. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what Safari is the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Firefox can't do that because it doesn't know what operating system it's on.  Chrome doesn't know what operating.  So it can't take advantage of an operating system feature like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. System level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So Safari is more secure in that regard.  I don't you know.  If somebody has physical access to your logged in computer, you're they can put a  keystroke logger on their host, your host, there's so many things they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or your phone or your glasses.  Well, maybe not your. Well, that's why I said you shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should have a lock on your phone.  Yeah, you shouldn't let your phone go around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually far more effective, though.  My every time my phone goes off, it comes back on lock.  I can leave my desk at the office with my machine open for and I don't have it.  Right. You don't go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I mean, Google could address this and I bet you they do with a  LastPass style password store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Heck, they could even do it with touch screens.  They could even do it with a swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So they could totally do this.  But I just feel like it is kind of misleading to say, well, we're going to  secure it in case somebody has physical access to your computer because there's  so many other things they can do anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes me nervous.  It just makes me nervous that the tech that the passwords are stored,  presumably, you know, kind of in the clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're not stored in the clear, but the browser has to have a way to  unencrypt them otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Couldn't send it.  Yeah, yeah.  It shows them in the clear when you click show.  So you have to click show.  So it's probably doing some sort of hashing them somehow doing it to hash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, they're not stored in the now.  That was the flaw that Firefox had earlier.  And maybe they still do if you didn't password your password store, you can put  it in additional. It was in the clear.  It was on the hard drive in the clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's the same as having a password dot text file on your desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a real flaw.  Yeah.  And that's why we always told people and I presume that that advice still applies.  If you're letting Firefox store your passwords, give it a password to protect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google doesn't offer that kind of protection, but I presume that it's and I'm  sure this is the case where we would have heard about it.  It's not storing your passwords in the clear on the hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Right.  So Steve was just he didn't he didn't think he didn't think that Google was at  not at all.  He said this is this is bogus.  Sure.  Their responsibility on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said this is bogus.  If Steve's OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  If Steve's OK, then I'm good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said, look, if you really have a world of hurt, if somebody's got physical  logged in access to your computer, the least of it is getting your passwords out  of your browser.  There's so many, so many things they could do to you in seconds, much faster,  frankly.  What are they?  So they got to open Chrome, get in there, take a screenshot, mail it to themselves.  What are they going to do?  Or if they bring along a USB key, they can put malware on there in about five  seconds, you know, or even download the malware.  They can go to a known infected site and infect you.  There's so many ways to do this.  It is, I guess the legitimate point would be that Chrome could do this better.  But I understand Google saying, well, there's a trade off to doing that.  And it isn't it doesn't make the fundamental situation more secure, which is that  somebody has access to your computer, unfettered access to your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, I guess you could make the argument that it would be for PR more than anything.  Yeah, that's why they would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Hey, well, we fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but then, yeah, but I could copy your entire hard drive and go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, not on my Chromebook, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The real, the real good advice is don't use a browser of any kind to store your  passwords. Use LastPass or something like it.  But LastPass, I know, is safe and doesn't store your, you know, it's highly, it's  encrypted. Even if they get access to your hard drive without your LastPass  password, they can't, they can't do anything.  It's kind of equivalent to this two factor authentication thing where you can say,  no, I always use this computer, so don't ask me every time I use it.  Right.  Right.  You could say, oh, well, you know, that that reduces security.  Yes, because the presumption is this is a safe computer.  They even say if this is not, if this is a shared computer, don't use this option.  Right.  Well, it's a shared, if it's a shared computer, you shouldn't be storing the  passwords in your browser.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  If someone broke into my home and carried the computer off, I got bigger problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They might as well just take the computer.  They're really, they're really after you.  It's all on there.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The best thing to do would be to turn on LastPass, use LastPass only,  turn off browser storage.  I do, because I'd said, yeah, I don't want, and, and, and that, then you're,  they're much safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, and by the way, use two, two factor authentication on LastPass and you're  really good with Google authenticator.  And then you're really good.  I don't know.  I think it's a Tempest and a Teapot.  Team Steve seemed to think so as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that Google made such a different choice than  Safari and, and Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, Firefox is doing pretty much the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, at least Firefox is like, oh, here, here you can set this master password.  You know, Google's just saying outright, that's, that's not going to help you.  Yeah.  Well, that was less controversial than I, I wonder, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you aren't logged in at any, see, I'm always logged in on a  Chrome, if you're not logged in in any way, it will still offer to save passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do incognito window.  Well, that wouldn't do it either.  So let's, so a new profile, right?  So you can switch profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Elliot Kember, who wrote this, blog post, said, you know, the, the, the,  the, there are two sides of this developer side and the user's side.  Anytime I try to draw attention to this, I get the usual response from  technical people, just use one pass.  The computer is already insecure.  As soon as you have physical access, that's just how password management works.  He says, while all of these points are valid, this doesn't address the real  problem Google isn't clear about its password security.  Um,  by displaying your passwords in plain text outside your key chain without  requiring a password.  Yeah.  And then Justin shoe, who's head of Chrome security responses is just  not going to change your wrong.  And Steve was Steve had kind of the same attitude like, well, of course not.  Anyway, Hey, now you know, and that's the best thing everybody now knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't be disappointed.  You're disappointed.  We didn't have any cause for fits or anything, but I'll bring you a cause for a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I see.  I see.  J Jarvis will have a fit right here.  No, that's not that one.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got so many.  This is a quick fit.  Katie Couric just tweeted that she has a year's free Chipotle burritos.  What are we chop liver tacos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she is on a major, isn't she on a major or maybe not.  What have we done for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, you know what folks, I don't want the burritos.  I want advertising on twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Katie Couric is about four feet tall.  How many burritos could she eat?  Not many.  That's what they're not looking at me saying.  We'll give him free burritos for a year.  Oh no.  Are we still Chipotle fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, it's, it's waned for me.  Yeah.  Like Lee, much like Lee, it's waned a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to find new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.  We need to find new stuff.  Yeah.  So if you are, okay, so I created a new Chrome profile.  I'm not signed into Google.  I just signed into Netflix, it was random and it did offer to save passwords.  So you're right.  This is not connected.  This is not at all connected to whether or not you're signed in with Google.  So Google could not use Google sign in to, to verify your identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it just saves because everybody expects a browser to save passwords.  Like my mom would go crazy if the browser didn't save passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Bob's big boy and, um, let's see, what was it that you liked?  What was that show you like?  We don't have those.  That show you didn't want to admit you liked the bachelorette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, bachelorette.  Bob's big boy in the bachelorette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll replace Glee and Chipotle.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  All right.  Five guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, five guys is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like five guys.  Do you have five guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  We can make it five guys cause they're nationwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Out here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can't do it on Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not, no, it's not out there and the white castle is not out here.  And so it's so hard with your fast food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take that Chipotle and Katie Couric, your girlfriend, she holds up the  card with a jar of Tums.  Now how's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's good advertising Chipotle.  You got to be really happy about that mention.  Huh?  I tell you these celebrities, they're so used to getting the gift baskets.  The free stuff.  They just don't appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Moto phones before anybody else.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it turned out I was, uh, somebody tweeted me, uh, there were  apparently two Moto events.  I went to the first one, which was the, yeah, the blogger.  Oh, there she is.  Hello, Katie.  She's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still like you Katie, but Chipotle has come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Really Katie?  Come on.  Printed art made out of wood.  I didn't even know they had that.  Free, free Chipotle for, I see we've got her name on it.  Katie Couric's custom made burrito card.  Handcrafted, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Freebirds to free birds.  I say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, I just, it's like, I'm not surprised at Chipotle doing that.  I'm surprised at her making a big deal out of it.  Don't you know, Katie, we celebrities have a code that if you get free stuff,  what, you know, what happens at Chipotle stays at Chipotle.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think they paid her?  Did they pay her?  You think she getting money?  No, she got free burritos.  She might have, they might be advertised cheap.  She doesn't cost much.  Few free burrito.  I mean, because I'm on it seriously.  How many burritos is she going to eat?  So Porter Gale, who is a publicity person.  Went to the second event and Christy Yamaguchi was there.  All these famous people were there the next night.  So clearly Motorola, Guy Kawasaki had a clever strategy.  Bloggers night one, celebrities night two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First the schlubs and then the stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And guess according to Porter, they didn't have to sign an NDA.  Whoa.  Well, cause they figured Christy Yamaguchi was going to be  listening to her anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to start her own EV leaks, Twitter handle.  Exactly.  Christy Yamaguchi leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An odd celebrity list guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I should get the, I don't have the whole list.  Porter wrote an article.  Let me see if I can find it.  She wrote an article about the Moto X launch in which she talked about  to drop the name of all the celebrities that were at hers.  You know, the title of her post was how Google enlists bloggers to spread  the word for Moto X.  But then when I saw who went to her event, it wasn't bloggers.  It wasn't bloggers.  It was like Christy Yamaguchi.  And I guess her, let me see if I can find the, this, the list she  mentioned dropped all the names here.  There were no NDA forms, no security checks, no formalities.  All right.  Christy Yamaguchi and her hockey playing husband, Brett Hedekan,  a champion Frisbee player.  Pretty low level celebrity.  It was like B-list.  Okay.  Well, it was B-list bloggers too.  So David Kelly, the founder of IDEO.  It was like the celebrity one.  I wanted to go to the celebrity one.  Yeah.  Next time guy.  Okay.  Well, there's something, there's gotta be something more to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no next time because there's no NDAs for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Handheld.  I know never again.  Handheld remote for Google Glass.  This, this one says Jarvis will have fits.  So instead of having, why will you have fits?  This is called Ramat and it allows you to keep it, keep your hands in your  pockets while you're wearing your glass.  I can't remember what I was going to have a fit about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I may have done some dog run down organization and miss that third column.  Sorry.  Oh, this is, this is not the street view story, but the, so you can navigate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  glass directly, I mean, discreetly.  So you can take pictures without anybody knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's actually something you got to hold.  So it's, you can hold it in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is even creepier, but it's kind of ridiculous.  If you think you need, that means they made a mistake on the UI.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause you just do the blink side load.  Now this is killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't remember what I was going to have a fit about Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about this Hulu plans to put Hulu plus on Google Chromecast.  That's good news.  The more stuff I see on Chromecast, the happier I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've been really digging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really digging it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just use it for music all the time.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been using it for Netflix a lot, which is, I know that I've, I've,  you know, 17 devices in my house that could probably play Netflix, but I just  been, you know, TV's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HBO ghost says they're going to do it.  Vimeo, they already announced Pandora.  They already announced.  Yep.  I'm telling you Amazon streaming.  That's all I'm missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazon streaming.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, Chris Jeff's a little busy now with the, with the Washington post.  Oh, that's a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  There's one to ask Jarvis about what does Bezos want with a dying medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have no idea.  Let's be very clear about that.  Uh, there's a lot of speculation.  People are guessing, you know, one, one, one report said that he wanted their  delivery trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he doesn't need their delivery trucks.  He's got something called FedEx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well for local delivery, but that's ridiculous.  Um, so what I'm doing, what I concentrate on instead is what I hope he does.  Uh, I've been arguing, you've heard me blather on about how our business should  be about relationships and he understands better than anyone else, how to build  individual relationships and thus deliver relevance and value.  Jeff, please do that.  He understands how to build platforms.  So people do stuff around him.  Please do that, Jeff.  Uh, you know, I, I hope that he can really reconsider how it operates from, from  the scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Calcanneson is a newsletter sent out a great newsletter saying it's crazy.  He says, look at all the ways newspaper, it sucks to own a newspaper.  Craigslist takes all your classifieds.  Niche sites take your audience and your top journalists.  No one wants dead trees on their doorsteps.  News breaks is processed and largely resolved in the same day on Twitter.  Some of the country's last unions are grinding down already ground down  newspapers.  You can't disagree with all that.  He gives six theories, ego.  He says, given the Red Sox guy bought the globe, right?  Newspapers are the new sports team for the billionaire set.  Chris Hughes bought the new Republic, the Facebook CTO about the new Republic.  Um, Bezos is buying influence in Washington.  I don't Calcans to be much cheaper just to buy more lobbyists.  Yeah, I don't think so.  250 million.  You get a lot of congressmen for 250 million bucks.  You can buy the whole damn thing.  Uh, newspaper delivery Trojan horse for daily home delivery.  That, that truck theory.  No Bezos will run for president.  He wants a bully pulpit in DC.  Also, also silly, um, legacy challenge.  And this is the one he says makes the most sense.  Bezos bought the Washington post because journalism is important  and he wants to figure it out.  That's kind of what you were saying.  Maybe he's got a secret plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The my, my fear, I have two fears about it.  I'm generally very hopeful about this and I'm an admirer of what Bezos has built.  The one fear I have is that it is as, as a reporter said to me, an  act of philanthropy and he'll just sit back and say, okay, I saved it.  I'll write the checks.  Yeah, that's what I think.  And that's, that doesn't do any of the cigarette money for him.  Right.  If he brings, if he truly brings in innovation, that's what we need.  The second fear I have is that it's how secretive he is and newspapers  need to be open, run openly.  And I want his innovation to occur openly, but you know, it's a different  world for him.  I'm hopeful.  I find it fascinating that the grams basically had to admit they had no strategy.  And so they had to find somebody who they thought couldn't vet the strategy for  it because they were tapped out.  And so I'm hopeful about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the New York Times strategy going to be successful?  Cause they have a strategy.  They have a digital strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a digital strategy.  They have a different strategy because they are an international strategy.  Now, now their national strategy clearly works.  And they have a successful paywall.  One of the few.  Um, yeah, there's still a little bit of debate about that, but yeah,  it works.  It brings in, uh, substantial money.  Uh, and they're going to try to expand internationally though.  I think that's going to be harder for them than they know.  They're going to compete with the guardian and BBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, I think you can't, I think newspapers can be at best national.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the guardian is a third of its audience is us.  A third is the rest of the world.  And the third is UK.  Really?  And it's grown incredibly because of the net.  So the guardians international BBC is a news brand is international.  Um, CNN is a news brand is international.  Um, though small, a wall street journal, less so FT, uh, was your left here.  More specialized.  It's possible, but it's a very hard thing to do.  It's very hard to monetize.  The, the mirror is now very big in the U S because it has celebrity gossip.  I take, I stand corrected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess you can do international.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can, but it's hard.  The problem with the post was, and I know this from friends who were there,  that the war that lasted until now was a war of, are we local or national?  Which the equivalent to that was, are we print or digital?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did it was, it was probably one of the few, uh, local newspapers with a  national reputation that didn't kind of become national, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the LA times wanted to be that.  Couldn't do it.  Ridiculous and stupid.  Uh, the, the times has to have been, but the CEO of the post was, you know,  not too long ago, still doing, um, um, PowerPoints about the wonders of print,  the sales force, national stuff we want to sell local.  So that was the war that was on there that they never settled.  And, uh, no, now we'll come a new owner and he's going to say, listen,  folks, this is what we gotta be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, I think Jeff Bezos is, this is, this is, this is philanthropy.  I can't imagine that a guy like Bezos who's so smart and has really figured  out, uh, the future of merchandising and it's online has any interest in the most  bricks and mortar bricks and mortar businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but, but he does, you know, if, if I argue that news is a service,  he understands service.  But what do you need a newspaper for?  You don't, but you have the brand and you make it into something new.  Yeah.  You get rid of the newspaper as soon as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the brand is an Albatross.  Really?  Yeah.  What is, what do you get with the name Washington post?  The only thing ever comes to mind is a, is Watergate.  Yeah.  He could have bought Woodward and Bernstein cheaper and it  would have been better.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Jeff has another problem here, which is that who are newspapers  advertisers, local merchants, who is Amazon killing local merchants.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Macy's is not going to advertise in a Jeff Bezos owned Washington post.  By the way, Amazon didn't buy WAPO.  No, Jeff Bezos did, but same difference.  Same difference.  I, I totally think it's, it's an act of philanthropy.  It's an act of nostalgia.  It's like Henry Ford buying a locomotive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, it's, it's, it's like, well, then it's amazing that  Buffett isn't the one who bought it.  Buffett left the board of the Washington post.  Buffett made some money on this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, he did.  What did he make?  Like a hundred million dollars.  He made a huge amount of money on this.  So you know what?  Warren could have gone to Jeff and say, Hey Jeff, would you buy this?  I mean, Warren did have a role in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Warren also called Bezos the best manager in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  He, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Warren's a smart guy.  He went to Jeff.  He stro, he patted him.  Only you could run this.  You're the guy.  You're the guy.  Run this.  And then he comes home with a big check.  He doesn't have the headache of having to worry about a dying medium.  But here's the funny one.  Jeff, if you want to buy something, you know, AM radio, it's going to be big.  It's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge.  The right leadership, just with the right leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All it needs is leadership.  Just get Marissa to buy that.  You know, here's the funny one.  She will, by the way.  Who is Don Graham closer to than Jeff Bezos?  Who?  Mark Zuckerberg.  He's on the board of Facebook.  Imagine if the news had been that Mark Zuckerberg is by the Washington  Post would have been hilarious.  It fits everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's enough of that.  Enough of that.  That's what I was going to have a fit about.  I now see no Gino.  You didn't mess it up.  What are you going to have a fit about?  Google the Castro's house in  Cleveland, the guy who who held the three women hostage for all those years,  not hostage, but prisoner.  And they just and the town destroyed the house today as a.  That's a very smart thing.  But before the house was destroyed, Google blurred it on Street View.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are they protecting us from?  What are they doing to the to the record?  You know, should they blur the walls?  The World Trade Center site, too, because it has unpleasant memories.  It's not up to Google to do that.  I just I just we're not Wermany, dammit.  And I was I was a bit offended by their censorship of the real world.  So I just wanted to say that it's not a full fit, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems weird to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean.  Unless.  I mean, you know, unless there was someone in the window.  There's.  It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a reason why I should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, so that's that's the end of my fit.  That was so they leveled the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize that.  A little house today. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which is a fine thing to do, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one of the victims was there to kind of help,  but I certainly understand that desire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you think was?  I mean, maybe there was.  Maybe there was. Oh, I know it had Christmas lights on it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, that would make no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I have I just received.  This is something we'd like to offer Katie.  Correct.  It's free twit episodes for you, Katie, for life, not just a year forever.  It's made of wood.  And I just want you to know that this is waiting for you at the twit broadcast, Katie.  As long as you tweet about it and no Tums.  That's my only condition.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Christmas scene of the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Christmas scene of the guy who invented the hashtag is leaving Google.  He's going to start join a startup named Neon Mob.  I like Chris a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Chris, a lot too.  And I like Chris when he's when he's talking more, when he's blogging and he's more  he's out there kind of.  And when he was a Google, it was sort of a little bit of a quiet period.  I felt like. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Near very much. Maybe that's why he left.  He just wanted to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was he who on Twitter first had the idea that if you put the pound sign,  the hash sign in front of a word, it would make it easier to search for tweets  about a certain subject.  And boy, it was has his baby taken off, arguably even more successful than  Twitter itself.  You see him everywhere.  Yeah, you can't you can't watch a TV show without a hashtag.  I just saw a picture of the Portland police car with hashtag Portland police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alec Baldwin was on Howard Stern a week ago, and after he's gone through all his  his Twitter kerfuffles, he said that he imagined his gravestone would just say  hashtag dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that will live forever as hashtag just, you know, a moment in time?  Question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a good question.  I think that it's had a pretty good long moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't have predicted that, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I wouldn't have.  I mean, certainly a longer moment than, say, like QR codes or, you know, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know. It lives in history, no doubt.  Yeah. Occupy Wall Street, things like that.  Lives in history.  But it is a ridiculous kludge on a limited system.  Right. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, because it's just you know what at signs live at signs live right for  email and now for Twitter.  It's a signal.  What follows is this is the canonical name for something in a namespace at sign  Leo Laporte in Twitter, the namespace or Leo at twit TV in the twit TV namespace.  And that what hashtag says is this is a search term and if it would be fruitful  for you to search on whatever follows the hashtag, I think it's just a signal.  And it's a brilliant signal.  It comes from it comes from the notion of taxonomy.  I mean, you can really credit in some way, Katerina Fakis to her Butterfield for  creating taxonomies and Flickr, which were the logical predecessor.  They didn't have the hashtag.  But same idea. You tag a photograph because you can't search on it when you can now  with Google. But at the time, you couldn't search for the contents of a photo.  So the hash, the tag was so critical.  What was the way to create a Flickr or Delicious Delicious Josh actor Delicious?  Did Josh do it first?  And then I'm not sure.  But it was like Flickr predated Delicious.  But I don't know. They're both killed by Yahoo.  That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo's getting a new logo, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? No purple.  Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I guess they're working on a new logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, I bought the whole staff purple t-shirts hoping that Marissa would buy so we  could have that picture that everybody does, you know, the entire team in purple.  No. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they're going to ditch purple.  And I don't think they're going to ditch the exclamation point either, which was my  only really interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, because that's such a pain in the ass.  All right. Let's take a look at the new.  This is from the Washington Post, the nation's new paper.  Bezos paper. The Bezos, the Washington Bezos, the Bezos Daily.  They're taking down the sign.  That's the old picture of the of the famous San Francisco Yahoo sign.  Where's the new? I don't see the new logo in this Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're putting a new logo up a day for 30 days and then we'll see it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's a 30 day countdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So on the site, I think there's a new logo a day.  And somebody said a new logo we shouldn't care about because we know it's not the logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Thirty bad logos.  Yeah, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we're talking about it.  Doing a good job.  We get rid of I don't like today's at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what? This is Marissa.  This is, you know, she was most famous at Google for her.  You know, the design sense, the design sense of the Google homepage.  And she would obsess over the different shade of blue.  So these are this is just typography.  Come on. You're going to be doing more than I want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to be rid of the dog's member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get rid of the dog's member.  Seriously. The current today's is ugly.  Yeah, it's see this over here.  It's ugly. Yeah.  Let's castrate the Yahoo logo.  Bad kerning.  And still has the dog's member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, even if you're going to say go back to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't know what a dog's member is, you're not missing anything at all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything else we should talk about before we get to our picks of the week?  I'm looking down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think under the security, there's one least amusing thing here,  which is that former NSA chief Haydn  warned that if Snowden got apprehended,  that there'll be cyber attacks on everything.  Good. And he called our people our nihilists, anarchists,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  activists, lulz, anonymous, 20 somethings who haven't talked to the opposite sex  in five or six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guy, this is straight out of Dr.  Strange Love. Yeah, it is.  Practically talking about precious bodily fluids.  Yeah, yeah.  Who are these people and why are they running things?  So depressed by that story.  It's really hard for me to to be chipper right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I wrote a post in The Guardian in which I argued that it is time  for the major tech companies to come forward and make clear  whether they are collaborators or yes, the NSA's overreach.  They're collaborators.  And Bruce Schneier then wrote a wonderful post, too,  that said we've got to restore trust in the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to try to get Schneier on next week and have him talk  because he's the greatest. Love, Bruce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. That'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nihilists, anarchists, activists, lulz, sec, anonymous,  20 somethings who haven't talked to the opposite sex in five or six years.  They may want to come after the US government for frankly,  you know, the dot middle stuff is about the hardest target in the United States.  Oh, don't say that out loud.  So if they can't create great harm to dot mill, hey, who are they going after?  Who for them are the World Trade Center's?  Oh, this guy, this guy should not be allowed to speak.  But he ran the NSA. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're the wagons are so circled.  The big question is whether the whole  kerfuffle right now about about security in the Middle East and US embassies is  I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I never have been.  I always presume the world is not that well organized.  But I now my faith is shaken and I wonder whether they're they're not pumping this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Another favorite thing today.  Oh, yeah. We look what we found. There's chatter.  You see, it works. We found chatter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But of course, of course, Snowden stopped them from talking the same way.  So we don't know. The other great thing today was Daily Beast has a story  that that Al Qaeda, the reason they began all this was Al Qaeda held a conference  call, which led to all kinds of great Twitter jokes about, you know,  oh, don't you hate this whole music?  It makes me so angry. I want to blow up the world.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Gibson was talking about this  on the previous show on security now, apparently a few months ago, the FISA  court ruled that what was going on was unconstitutional.  So the all the report was classified.  Yes. Yeah, you can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The court has no objection.  The government won't let it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it objects. But no, you can't see it.  So the secret court has to stay secret. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One more little thing, Leo, I suppose we should follow up  because it amounts to I should have warned Chad to cue this.  The life still can show it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That just imagine if you will, some reggae going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so if you to refresh your memory, very briefly, the  the German publishers went to the legislature that got passed a law  that says you can't quote us, you can't snippet us, you can't steal our soul.  And so Google said, fine, we won't.  You have to opt in for us to  quote you a link to you.  Good. Every single publisher, including actual springers,  one started all opted in.  So Google won German publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buccus, I think that's exactly the way to handle it.  That's fine. No problem.  Brilliant. Brilliant. No problem.  Yeah, that kind of shuts up all the all the criticism.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Our tool tip and number of the week.  And don't forget, coming up in just a few minutes, triangulation Stewart Chafee  will join us, the host of the longest running computer  television show of all time, Computer Chronicles,  which was started in the mid 80s, I think.  And and it'll be great fun to see Stewart here in studio in just a moment.  But first, a word from Hover.com.  If it's time to register a domain name, stop.  Don't go to the place you always go. Go to hover.com.  They've taken domain name registration.  They've made it simple.  They've created domain management that is easy and powerful.  There's no upsell.  There's no BS. It's friction free.  And you're going to love it.  They just launched Google Apps for Business.  So you can add it to a new domain or to one you already own through hover.  That's fabulous.  There's no heavy handed up selling or aggressive cross selling.  They don't believe in hiding functionality or requiring payments  for things that should just be included.  For instance, privacy.  You know, you want who is privacy.  Well, it's built in.  Hover provides it automatically. Subdomains automatic URL forwarding automatic.  Hover only offers services that enhance the domain name experience.  Not a lot of upsell. They don't do hosting.  They only partner with companies they believe offer value.  You can get all the big top level domains dot com, of course, dot net,  which is a great alternative choice, dot org, but also dot TV dot pro dot  mobi dot biz, all the country codes like dot C.A. Asia and UK.  I think, you know, dot net is a great one.  You'll see a lot of dot net choices still around.  We're kind of moving over from dot com.  All the good ones are taken on dot com.  Great online help, support documentation, tutorials.  They even have a concierge service that'll move your existing domains over.  That's the way to do it. Hover dot com.  And they one of their one of their selling points is a no hold, no wait,  no transfer phone support.  When you call during business hours,  you'll be speaking with a live person who is empowered and eager to help you.  Hover created by two cows.  This is their new thing.  Elliott and Austin crew are just trying to take businesses  that are so poorly managed that they're just begging for fixing  and that domain name registration. Absolutely one of them.  I want you to try it today.  Visit hover dot com slash twig.  You'll get 10 percent off your domain name registration.  Hover dot com slash twig.  We got people tweet me all the time.  What was the name of that domain registrar you recommend?  Remember hover.  Like a little hummingbird hover dot com slash twig.  It's time for Gina Trapani's tool.  I'm sorry, tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little tip this week for people who spend a lot of time in Google Docs  like I do, I spend a lot of time in Google Docs and I often have to link stuff.  Hyper hyperlink, if you will, if you want to go back to 1993, certain words.  And there's a quick shortcut to do that.  Now, if you type a word like, say you type twit  and then you select it and this is in Google Docs and Google Slides,  Google will actually show a dropdown with search results with like the  the likely search results like Twitter TV or maybe Wikipedia on Twitter.  Right there in the dropdown, you could just click on the link to to link that word.  This is a new thing.  And this is something I do in Google Docs all the time.  And it always is the like you have to open up another browser tab and do your search.  This all happens inside Docs now.  So I'm going to try next time you want to link  links and text inside Google Docs or slides.  I'd like to see this happen in in Sheets soon as well.  What a great idea.  Help doing the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Cool.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go back up here and, you know, just as we move from Chipotle  and give up on them because they were nice to Kitty Kirk, not us.  And we've picked five guys burgers.  Yes, often already. I'm often already.  You're done. I can't wait.  I'm going to Bryn burgers. Bryn. What's that Bryn burger?  Sergey spent three hundred thirty thousand dollars to  subsidize the creation of this test to burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's meat made in a test tube, not by a cow.  Exactly. How does it taste?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea is evidently that you miss the fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they can add fat.  Yeah, but they can.  I could be could just do some lipo on the cow.  Wouldn't kill him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could you could recycle yourself or yourself.  Even better fat out.  Put it in the burger, eat it, take it out, put it back.  It works beautifully. Even better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is one of these? Can I go now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they did have a tasting some some some press went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always wondered why.  I really always wondered why you have to have an animal make your meat.  Why can't you just grow it in vats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what he's doing.  Let me put I'll put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I admire these guys because they're just living the science fiction life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are living the dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you a vegetarian, Gina? No, you eat meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not. I do. I'm an omnivore. Omnivore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, then it would be  then you could be a vegetarian with conscience because no animal was killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it seems like it would also be more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a video in the chat on the rundown.  I put a video and I just found of I haven't watched it.  It was Sergey explaining why he did this vegetarian meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oops. It's very clean.  Oh, here we go.  Sergey paid 100. How much?  Three to thirty thousand dollars for a hamburger.  That's Kobe beef.  We're going to get an ad first. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes, you know, the it's six minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got to watch this.  This is how Sergey is paying for the beef.  I like to look at technology opportunities

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where the technology seems like it's not going to be a big deal.  Technology seems like it's on the cusp of viability.  And if it succeeds there, it can be really transformative for the world.  The story of human evolution.  Is it made of people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soylent Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always wondered that.  I mean, but I see I'm the one who's advocating for human chow.  We've got puppy chow and gorilla chow.  You know, zoos for years have been able to feed animals  a nutritionally complete food.  Why don't we have human chow?  Just asking.  I would just eat it. It would be easy.  Somebody's making who makes soylent purple. Yeah.  Dr. Mom says we do have human chow.  She is in our chat room, a regular, and she her specialty as a physician  is feeding people through tubes, intubating people and feeding them.  And I guess that's what they would pump down the tube is human chow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, human chow. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe it wouldn't be good.  It's not sure, is it? No.  My tool of the week is something that's been around for a while,  but I finally just kind of got around to trying it.  I'm so excited about it's BlueStacks.  You know about BlueStacks.  It's a Android emulator for Windows or Mac.  Let's you literally run Android apps inside of your Mac or your PC.  So, for instance, I'm going to search for my favorite app.  Tapped out, which I can't play anymore.  So it's safe for me to search for it.  And when you do that, it'll show you three different stores  that you can install it from.  Oh, I have to enable the app store.  I haven't enabled it on this one, so I won't do that right now.  But you see, this is Android.  I mean, it's really an Android experience, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you then cast that on Chromecast to your big TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that would be cool. But no, it's not in a browser.  But maybe the BlueStacks folks will  that would be a nice thing for them to do.  Maybe BlueStacks folks, you should add a Chromecast button to your BlueStacks.  This is Android running an emulation.  I don't know what version it is, you know, off the top of your head, Gina.  I don't. It doesn't say.  But it's I was running tapped out at home and it ran fine.  I mean, it crashed because my my tapped out crashes,  but it ran right up to the point where it would normally crash.  It ran fine. And other apps, the most popular apps on here are games,  as you might imagine, you know, wouldn't it wouldn't you like to be able to play  some of those great Android games on the desktop?  Some of those Android games are actually better than the games  on on desktop computers. So  BlueStacks is free from BlueStacks.  I think it's dot org. Let me check.  But I really you know, somebody told me somebody sent me an email saying,  you know, you should just be playing the Simpsons on your computer.  I knew about BlueStacks. I've known about for some time.  Yeah, BlueStacks dot com.  Dot com. Dot com.  Play bigger. Yeah, very cool. Yeah, very cool.  Yeah. Ten million downloads.  So I guess I'm not telling you anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, available for Windows and Windows and Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Works just fine.  And yeah, it's a great idea.  I'll put my tapped out on here when it gets back.  You know, crash electronic arts rip me off.  They owe me 1400 donuts.  Oh, I know. Jerks.  Jerks. Jerky jerky jerks.  Jeff. No, actually, I'm relieved because I was badly hooked on that show.  It's good. It's good to not be able to play it anymore.  Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts.  And what would Google do? He blogs at Buzz Machine.  Do you still blog or write for a medium as well?  I do. Yeah.  Another place you can see stuff.  Yeah. Does everything at  medium show up on Buzz Machine or is there unique?  So no mix mix. All right, cool.  So go to both places.  Jina is, of course, the author of Think Up Think Up Dotcom, the great  Twitter statistics analyzer  and and of to do text, a great to do list for both iOS and Android  and blogs at SmarterWear.org and is the mother of that.
