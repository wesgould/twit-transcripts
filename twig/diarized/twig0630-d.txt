Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, y'all.  Oh, here, let me.  No, no.  Why?  Why?  Well, because I don't need them for doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glasses make you look smart.  Er.  You know I'm smart.  I know that's true.  You don't need the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's overkill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's over.  Now you're too smart.  True.  That's Aunt Pruitt.  Making sure Leo stays in line.  Twit.tv slash hop.  That's right.  And a community manager over at the club Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How you be, sir?  You out of weight?  Because you had to get up bright and early.  I've been here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My third, fourth show of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's running on fumes, folks.  Cranking it out.  I'm expecting some punchiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why, but I'm always punchy on this show.  This show is the punchiest show I do.  It's my Friday.  It's my Friday afternoon show.  I usually have a six pack right before the show.  And I've seen the beer bong.  I've seen the beer bong in your office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so Jeff's not here, but Jason Howell is sitting in for  Jeff Jarvis.  Jason Howell from All About Android and Tech News Weekly.  And our producer, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because...  Yeah, so I'm going to be doing double duty.  I'm going to be talking sometimes.  And then I'm going to be taking notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's how it rolls.  He warned me earlier.  He said there's nothing to talk about.  I said, welcome to Twit.  We don't need anything to talk about.  It's that's part of the fun of it.  Actually, I was up early 8 a.m.  my time, 11 a.m.  Eastern for the Surface event, Microsoft's new Surface event.  And, you know, they announced new laptops and stuff.  But one of the things they did announce that I thought was  interesting, they came back and did the second version of  their folding phone, which I, you know, to all reports was  not a huge success first time around.  But Microsoft's decided they're going to try again.  I bought the original Duo a year ago and returned it within  a couple of weeks.  They have a I think they have a 30-day return policy, which  is good because there's 1500 bucks got my money back.  But this one answers a lot of the I don't know the concerns  the complaints we had originally for one thing.  It has a decent camera system this time.  Three lenses, telephoto, medium and wide.  They look like a decent camera.  You know, it's not going to be nobody's trying to keep up with  the well, everybody's trying to keep up with the iPhone, but  nobody's succeeding.  But I think it'll be OK.  They're also answering another qualm people had, which is when  it was closed, it's a two screen device with a hinge.  So it's like a little book and was closed.  You had no indication about what was going on inside.  So they've solved that by adding a little bit of a screen  on the edge there to let you know what time it is, how much  batteries left.  If you've got notifications, leaving signal is if the phone  is ringing.  They've added NFC, which it didn't have before.  It's a fast processor, eight gigs of RAM, 888 Snapdragon.  So in every case, they've upgraded it significantly.  And it's running Android 11.  Comes out October 21st.  Oh, 12 will be out by then, right, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  12 will just be out by then.  I mean, the guess is that 12 is going to be out sometime  early October.  But that's like the initial launch.  I kind of understand when a hardware company releases a  device within the first month of a brand new OS.  Although it is pretty amazing when a new device actually  launches with the brand new OS.  That seems like a missed opportunity sometimes.  I think the big deal here and realizing that I'm merely  a third-person observer of the original device of this.  I think I'd pod at it a little bit, but I really didn't get  a whole lot of firsthand experience with it, is the  processor.  Because my understanding of that first device was that...  It was 855.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think why this is good is because we're starting to see  these foldables actually come out with the top-of-the-line  processor, which I think is really important.  Before they had to kind of ramp things down.  Maybe it's a cost thing because these things were going to be  expensive no matter what.  And so to kind of bring that cost down to a more palatable  place, they ended up ramping it down with processors saying,  people aren't getting this because of the processor.  They're getting this because it folds, and that's pretty cool.  Now they're finally saying, well, wait a minute.  These are freaking expensive devices.  We should make them be able to stand up to the best devices  out there.  So I think that's really good that they're doing that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As you saw when she holds it to her head.  It's a little bit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say she did that wrong because nobody that  age holds the phone that way.  They hold it like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're talking into it.  No one puts their phone to their ears.  Well, actually, I meant to ask you because you're the only  person I know who's under 80 is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  It's a joke.  Under 60.  I was watching Billions on Sunday night on Showtime, which  is back and it's one of my favorite shows.  They all have surfaces everywhere.  But what's interesting is nobody would ever make a phone  call on this show.  Well, there are a few people, old people, were holding the  phone to the ear.  In every other respect, they were doing video calls, FaceTime  or Duo or something like that.  A lot of that.  Is that just a TV show trying to show off Microsoft  hardware or do people actually do that?  Young person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't see any.  If you hang out with young people and they're actually  forced to talk about it, and this is a forced, this is not  something they do voluntarily.  They do this.  If they're talking and this is a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're talking into the bottom of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  My daughter, like when she sits there and like, and I'm like,  okay, talk to grandma.  She's like, why are they doing that?  Hey grandma.  Why are they doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that from watching the Kardashians too much?  Why are they doing that?  That's a way weird.  My daughter has never seen the Kardashians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to break it to you.  Old folks do that too.  They hold it the same way.  It's true.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I explain why people hold the phone that way on TV?  They on the reality shows.  They hold the phone this way so that the camera operator,  they put it on speaker phone so the camera operator could  see their face and hear the call.  It's completely an artificial thing that was started a few  years ago for reality television.  But apparently people have decided this is the new way to  talk to the phone.  But everybody hears your grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're on your headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens is you're on your headset.  You'll talk to them if you have to like this, but you're  also like looking stuff up on your phone because they're  usually like texting you pictures or something that's  happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so that's different.  So they're talking to the microphone because they have  headphones in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we need to explain to people who are listening to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  show what we're doing?  We're talking to the butt of the phone sideways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My parents, my parents are talking to the butt of the  phone.  That's how they talk.  When I'm on the phone 90% of the time I've got an earbud  in and that's how I'm doing it.  Yeah, because if you have earbuds in you got a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't even you can put the phone down.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Full mobility.  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we're not old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like yeah, my daughter if she again she doesn't she  the only people she talks on the phone to are my parents  like her friends.  Yeah, nobody else calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we text.  Right.  We text I for some reason my 29 year old daughter is old  for her age because she she said I don't like to text.  Can I call you and that's like no I want to text.  I don't want to call.  It's hard to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like you so dad gum cool, sir.  I got to tell you she's pretty daggone.  She's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She has she dueled me this today and that was okay.  I was right.  So I'm thinking yeah, I'm thinking so by the way I ordered  the duo.  I'm embarrassed to admit on Windows Weekly, but I did it  last year and returned it if you have a fairly flexible  return policy.  I think it's 30 days.  Don't quote me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I got to tell you when you when you returned it last  year it it hurt my heart because I thought that thing  had so it was so close.  It hurt my heart.  It was yeah, but when you returned it and told us about  how clunky and bad it was it hit it really hurt.  It wasn't a hard work problem a nice device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a software problem.  They didn't they didn't you know, they had all this promise  with the two screens and very few apps used it some like  the Kindle app you could turn a page like you were reading  a book but it didn't and it didn't work well dragging  things between and for instance when you open Google Maps  where the hinge was Maps thought was a screen it thought  it was on a big screen.  So there's a portion of the screen of the map obscured by  the hinge instead of just using two screens.  So it but that's things that can be fixed and I'm my hope  is this time.  So I wanted to give them another chance.  That's why and it's going to have a good camera system

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this time pricey, but it's a nice-looking piece of hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm 1500 bucks isn't as expensive as it used to be.  I mean the iPhone was 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the what was the the Samsung Galaxy Fold?  How much is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the same price actually it's 2000.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No the fold is 1800 1800 for the Z Fold for the Introductor.  Yeah for the like baseline.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have too many phones at this point, but I feel like well  I should probably check them out.  I'm not going to get the new iPhone because I don't think  I need to but I got the Z Flip remember the foldable and I  like that a lot.  I'm sure I'll get the Pixel 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't tell me you're not going to start shooting in  ProRes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't know when it's going to shoot ProRes.  One of those things that they put in there and everybody  gets excited about and then nobody uses I never used  Dolby Vision the whole year that I had it on that 12.  So I'm not too worried about that.  You have to be a Tik Tok Premiere or DaVinci Resolve

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and try to know I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know if I have if I shoot video it's just little clips  of things that were happening and you know, it's more for  memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'd like to see what our wonderful editor Mr.  Nielsen would do with the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he has a real camera, right?  He does.  So he's going to shoot with a real camera most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to argue right now that phone cameras can be  real cameras.  Not simply because I bought into like yeah, the shot on  the iPhone commercials, but I just think again the camera  you have is the camera that is going to work and you could  do a lot of really cool things with editing software and  the existing cameras.  You agree Mr.  Photographer?  I agree 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are there are things that a phone and I'm not just  saying iPhone a phone just not going to be able to do that  a regular even a PSC camera can do so but that's not to  say that the phones are just total crap and not useful for  photography, but they're quite capable, especially with  computational AI built into them.  So it's just going to make things a lot easier and they'll  still look pretty good.  You didn't like the white balance of the picture I took

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with the flip.  You didn't like the white balance.  It says blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, well that was user error.  That wasn't that was user error.  Ooh burn.  That's what I was getting ready to lead into next is Apple  Google and Samsung.  They do all these amazing ads and they look great, but they  never really specify that the people operating those those  phone phone cameras are pros.  They understand that they need to have a certain type of  light here or some back like there and understand focus pull  and stuff like that.  So that's why I said Mr.  Nielsen him holding that iPhone would be pretty daggum  awesome because he he gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He knows the craft right well, and I think a lot of times as  you say they bring lights along with them if they're  shooting for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so it's not really a real I mean it's not even just  lights.  It's like, you know stabilizing equipment.  Although now they have you know on board, you know stabilization  on a lot of these devices.  I think you know it's rigs.  It's rigs that you know, you have this tiny little phone.  It's like the center point and this huge rig behind it like  that's a lot of production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was the pixel for but with Miss Annie label  bits when she was the spokesperson for it and they did  a little b-roll of her shooting this beautiful fashion show.  That's right and whatnot.  And if you paused it you would see that she had a case around  her phone for handles on the side because right and stabilize  better that way, you know, and if you're more stable, you're  not going to get a bunch of motion blur and crispy shots  and stuff.  But that's just little things that most people don't tend to  think about is figure.  Oh, it's an iPhone.  It's the pixel that's going to look good soon as I click  shutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not always there's one thing I like about folding phones.  I liked about the Galaxy Fold and I think I will like about  the duo is that bigger viewfinder.  So when you open it up and you're taking a picture you do  see more of the picture.  Maybe I would notice that the white balance was often fixed.  Yeah, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't you know, I mean you look at that viewfinder you  should have seen that that the wonderful beautiful Miss Lisa  report had blue ish skin tones.  Come on, man.  I thought she looked good, but all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just shows what I know.  Anyway, I love is blind.  Yeah, love is bad.  That's right.  My wife is blue.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not blue.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next time Quinn Peru comes up asking me how something looks  I'm going to say I'm blind.  I love you.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to show you the picture.  It's a little blue.  I admit it now that you told me see but but but I wanted to  see the red of the tongue.  I was going for the red.  It's beautiful saturation, but why I could have fixed the  white balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just you you are of discriminating taste though and  you recognizes me looking at this photo like I see it when  you mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I see it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, without being told about it.  I probably I would probably be so focused on the sharp red  that the blue tongue pop.  I wouldn't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that saturation is beautiful.  Well, that's what I was really kind of showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the galaxy flip see and flip three and I didn't  really pay attention to the white balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's okay.  I know you subscribe to Twitter TV slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do and I'm learning.  I'm getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just real quick before we move on and one thing  that you mentioned, you know is that there are certain things  that real cameras can't do that's or sorry can do the  smartphones can't do the reality though is that for like  95% of people who are buying these phones what the smartphone  camera can do is like way better than what real cameras like  what they could even get out of a real camera if they had a  real camera because they're just not used to using a real  camera or even knowing that it could do these things.  So yeah, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree 100% computational photography makes stuff so much  simpler to just it's literally just tap the shutter.  But again, there's going to be some nuance on certain shots  that the phone is just not going to cut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's the why I think we're all everybody even  Apple phone users and Google.  I mean pixel.  I'm sorry Microsoft Duo owner Duo is both a Google app  and a very good trademark battle over that.  Anyway, Microsoft Duo owners all are still thinking.  Well, let's see.  In fact, Mary Jo Foley even said that I think my phone is  going to be the pixel 6.  We're all waiting to see what Google does with the pixel 6  for the first time.  We saw an image of the pixel 6 in somebody else's hands not  in Google's hands and it looks like it's got a shiny back on  it, right?  Yeah, it's a pretty glossy back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also got a possible launch date, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason, what's the launch date?  Do we know October 19th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was something.  Yeah, I think I saw something along those lines from an  Australian ad or something like that.  I can't remember.  I didn't look into that exactly someone in the chat is going  to probably link us to it.  But I mean my understanding is that you know, this is going  to come late October like like mid to late October is about  the time.  So we're about a month out from seeing the pixel 6 based  on what my understanding is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is going to be a very expensive October because  I'm looking for I'm about to upgrade and I need to get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  new MacBook and so I'm like, I know this fall is always a  so this is the we don't you know, know the provenance of  this but this is the leaked video of what is not a release  version of the phone, right?  This is a manufacturing prototype to show, you know a  test I think.  But yes shiny back.  There's that big.  I mean talk about camera bump.  Google's, you know, embracing the camera bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was about to say at least they made it interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think it's also saying because they didn't do  anything with the camera last year.  That's why I stuck with a pixel 4.  I didn't get a 5.  They're saying I think not so subliminally pay attention to  the camera because we're going to update this one.  So that's what I mean when I say people are even Apple  fans are waiting to see what Google does with the pixel 6  because they're the kings of computational photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say really really even Apple fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think even Apple fans, you know, Mary Jo Foley was saying  I was she's no Apple fan, but he's she said fans not sheeple.  I think everybody even Andy and not go even on Macbreak  Weekly.  Renee Richie said he's going to get a pixel 6.  I think people understand that when Google flexes not when  they're taking the year off like they did last year, but  when they're really pushing the envelope, there is nobody  better.  I know Mark LeVoy who was the king of all of that remember  when Mark LeVoy did get his amazing talk to Google Ios ago  be I believe yeah, he left and went to Adobe to work on  their software, but he was the king of computational that  he was the only good thing in that Google I o keynote two  years ago, but he was great and I think Google really has  a lot of scientists working on getting better images.  And so I think we all want to see what Google does with the  pixel 6.  Don't you?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I've got I've got my money ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a lot of us are standing there.  Take my money.  The pixel 6 is money ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason I like your strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to the Chelsea, New York, Chelsea store.  You can see apparently see a pixel 6 in the window window.  Yeah, so there it is.  You know, that's a nice back of that kind of that shiny creamy  looks like ivory almost back to try color.  Yeah, look at that little kind of peach top the black bar  where the camera bump is goes all the way across there.  So proud of the camera bump.  They've lined it in metal so you don't miss it and then that  creamy body.  I think this is signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a total signature this device and I really like  what Google's doing and continues to do as far as their  their marketing.  They had said earlier this year.  I mean even a couple of months ago that the push for pixel  6 was going to be their biggest hardware marketing effort for  one of their phones.  So we expect you know that Google is going to go big and  go all out for this but we're seeing all this push, you know  billboards promo videos, you know this thing in New York City  and it's coming out like like a snowball.  It's building we're seeing all this before they've even  officially like announced the release date or anything like  that.  I don't know.  I like this approach that Google's taking because it really  does put the power into their hands doesn't stop any of the  leaks as you just showed, you know, there's somebody who has  the hands-on video of it, but at least gives them a little bit  more control over it instead of letting just the fan base go  wild with it and make all sorts of assumptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of just there was a suspicious DHL delivery from  Mountain View, California that led to that leak, sir.  That's all I'll say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well say more.  That may be all you're going to say about that, but I really  want to know more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think Google's behind these leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well they might as well.  They might as well lean into it because it's going to happen  anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it was at a reputable place Mountain View is where

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is is what what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, so who who posted the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.  I don't know who the source of the of the hands-on video is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the last years have been these random YouTube users content

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  creators and yeah, cuz those people I mean like you would  go on and sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that there's some help from Google itself, especially  when they're like I want to say the last two were channels  that were in Asia somewhere or right based in Asia.  So they have access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well and the video that I showed on Twitter the symbol  on the back is not right the G that's that's a test symbol.  So it that was a manufacturing test.  These are pictures from the Google Store in New York.  These are real.  Okay, yeah that so so the two there's one with two cameras  and there's one with three as you can see that's kind of the  new thing at Apple's got three of its pros the and what they  tend to be is a ultra wide wide and normal or long.  Yeah.  In fact one of the reasons the only reason I would consider  getting the new iPhone is it's a 77 millimeter effective for  the perfect photo.  That's just right for portrait.  Yep.  Yeah, also what do you let's talk about colors because they  are two-tone.  The one on the bottom has an orange top and I guess pink on  the bottom then there's cream and buff.  So they are kind of subtly two-toned.  Yeah, I can't like those.  Yeah, I think they're pretty.  So these are close-ups of the of the phone floating in space  in the store.  I like that orange.  What do you think?  I like I like the orange to the problem is the orange is only

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the six and not the six Pro from my understanding.  So you're getting the six Pro your the six Pro seems to have  more muted color choices than the six and I think that's  that's too bad because I like the boldness of some of these  colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Google styling reminds me and I'm going to bring this  back to fashion for a hot second what Catherine Hahn wore  at the Emmys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did Catherine Hahn wore at the Emmys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you got to you got to check out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was she the one in the in the in the bathing cap in the rubber  gloves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she wore she wore love love.  I can't ever say it but it's a giant.  It's a black thing with this giant fat belt and every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like the second I saw that I was like, oh my God, she's like  the pixel six.  My husband was like you are such a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute now.  We got to take a look.  This is oh it is a big belt.  Oh my God, the enormous chunky belt.  Here we are.  Look at the size of that thing.  I don't know what that reminds me of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're never you're never going to be able to see that in  the pixel six together again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I love Catherine Hahn.  I know who you mean now.  Yeah, she was hilarious.  She was Agatha in in the WandaVision show.  I guess that's what she was nominated for.  But she also did a wonderful miniseries on HBO where she  played.  Well, I can't remember the name of it.  So I guess I'll stop but nice.  I like the big I like the big buckle.  She looks like she's a tiny tiny person with a watch band  around her.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I know that I know that's silly, but you know,  I have to we talked about fashion.  I'm going to start making it a regular thing in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Stacy's fashion update and then people are going to  say moment of the day Leo.  You're so sexist.  Why do you make the woman do the fashion update?  You know, you know that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you just tell them because aunt couldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it and wanted to clearly I want an aunt to do it.  But he you know, so the other rumor that is very interesting  we talked about this last week.  The jumbo check was jumbo.  What a name code name for a folding phone that apparently  Google plans to announce next month.  Is that what do you think Jason?  What's the what's the all about Android take on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily next month.  I don't know that we have that definitively but the sources  or the people who are coming out and saying yeah, this is  happening or saying by the end of the year we will have this.  So I mean on one hand it makes sense that it would be next  month.  On the other hand, we've seen absolutely no leaks outside  of like little bits of information.  I just don't I just don't trust that Google is that good at  keeping a secret like this keeping you know, keeping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you announce Pixel 6 in October and then two months  later announce a jumbo Jack?  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't make any sense.  It would absolutely not make sense for them to have an  announcement slash release in December because they're going  to want to capitalize on the Christmas the Christmas shopping  season.  So I don't know, you know, Apple Apple does the thing where  they do the phone right now and then a few weeks later they  do another hardware announcement, right?  Maybe Google did the same page out of that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm going to I'm going to go on record saying this is one  of those rumors where somebody's got it wrong or somebody saw  something in a lab but Google has no intention of releasing  it.  Here's ev leaks Evan blasts is tweet heard from somebody.  I trust that the foldable pixel code name passport retail  branding unknown will indeed launch before the end of the  year.  Apparently they've been working on this device for over two  years and if the p6 is any indication will be worth a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I would say, okay, let me just devil's advocate  here not in the jerky way, but in the just throw the way I  do it.  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do it.  Do it in Stacy style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate when people say that you're like you're going to say  something really offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me play devil's advocate, but you smell like a ripe  orange.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But people people who spend crazy money on these folding  phones.  I feel like they're they're early adopters.  They're tech nerds.  Google will probably have a replacement not a replay, you  know, a trade-in type of program and they're people like  you Leo who are like, hey, I'm going to buy six different  phones this year because I want to see what's happening  everywhere, right?  So I don't think they're releasing this with the  expectation that it's going to be like their number one  selling phone.  I think they're releasing it as a like launch that we're in  the folding space.  Here's our vision and then next year you'll see something  probably more mainstream.  Does that make sense?  I think that's totally plausible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, could be well, we'll find out according to  Tom's guide.  The date is October 19th.  So we'll find out not too far from now three weeks.  I cannot wait.  That's the thing.  I mean, I'm honestly thinking even Apple fans are saying  well, you know, yeah, I'm gonna have to get an iPhone because  I'm in the iPhone universe, but I really am curious what  the Pixel 6 is capable of.  Apple certainly set a high bar.  The low light photography in the new iPhone 13's are from  all the images I've seen.  The reviews came out yesterday and the images are spectacular  and low light just amazing.  So we'll see.  We'll see.  Hey, all I could say it's a good time to be buying a phone.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's a bad time to be a phone reviewer because you got a  lot of phones to buy.  It's a it's hardware season right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, it's hard out here for a hardware reviewer.  It's hard out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's wet from your brow, Mr.  Howe.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing my best to keep up.  Hang in there, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My thumbs have RSI injuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, let's take a little break.  We got lots more to talk about.  Thank you, Jason.  How's filling in for Jeff Jarvis who is is he traveling?  Jason, what's where is easy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's a good question.  We don't know.  He just said he couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Stacy, you're going to be out next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually the 13th.  Oh, am I out next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, did I say I was out next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, you're not out next week.  Jason knows all.  I will step in here and say no, it's not next week.  It's the week after the 6th of October.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I say the 6th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the one.  That's what you said in the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's the 13th.  No, it's the 13th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Okay, I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm already putting it in the dock.  It's not a big deal.  Not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My parents are coming in town and so y'all are fun and all, but I got to hang with my folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got to do it.  So anyway, Jason's here for Jeff Jarvis and Prudence also here.  Stacy Higginbotham.  She's not sure if she's here, but she might be here.  She thinks she's here.  It's probably next week.  She's not here.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  It's the 13th.  So it's good to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by a brand new podcast from Red Hat called Compiler.  Actually, Red Hat's some really good podcasts.  I was thinking of their other show, but I want you to listen to this new one.  Red Hat does the Command Line Heroes show, which is now in its new season.  This is the first season for Compiler.  Angela Andrews, Brent Siminoe host it.  They're great, by the way, and I love what they're doing, which is taking the questions  from the internal messaging at Red Hat, things people are talking about on the I don't want  to say I don't know if it's slack or matter most or whatever they're using, but the things  people are talking about and then turning them into podcasts.  It's really, really good.  They're short, sweet, interesting.  I just listened to the first episode.  They're all about 20 minutes long.  Should managers code?  Should managers code?  This was a hot topic on their internal message board.  They decided let's do an episode where we ask people at Red Hat what they think.  They talked to the CFO.  She said, no, absolutely not.  Once you're a manager, you've got to avoid getting sucked in by your coders and your  direct reports and writing the code yourself.  Just like a parent should never do the chores for their kids.  You've got to manage.  Then we heard from another manager who loves coding so much that he's been doing the advent  of code because he misses it.  He's doing coding problems.  Then another manager said, no, no, no.  You've got to keep your chops up.  You've got to code.  It's an interesting debate.  Should managers code?  That was just episode one.  They have many, many episodes.  They're up to four now, I think.  The most recent, do we want a world without technical debt?  That's a very interesting topic.  They go deep.  You'd be amazed how much you can get into 20 minutes, which makes me wonder why we go  so long.  This is one everybody's going to want to listen to who's in the tech industry.  How do you interview for a technical position?  Red Hatters who got through those technical interviews often say the whiteboard interview  is a terrible idea.  On the other hand, there's some value to it.  If you're looking to get into tech, you'll be interested in episode three.  What are tech hiring managers looking for?  Episode two.  What can video games teach us about edge computing?  Big topics, little topics, fascinating stuff.  Episodes are out now.  You should definitely subscribe.  The show is called Compiler.  You can listen to Compiler on Apple Podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts.  We'll also include a link on the show page for this show.  You can just go to twit.tv slash twig and find that link there and go right to it.  I think it's a great show.  I think Angela and Brent deserve a lot of credit for having put together a unique and  interesting way of thinking about some of the big issues in tech.  Compiler podcast.  Learn more at red.ht slash twit.  We thank Red Hats so much for their continuing support of our podcasts.  We're really glad to share the wealth and tell you about Compiler.  Let's see.  This is a product I will not buy.  You don't hear me say that very often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard you say that before.  It's totally false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This one I don't think I'd have any use for.  It's the new Facebook Portal, which they're kind of turning into like an Echo show or  a Nest Hub.  The Portal Go is $199.  There's also a Portal Plus for $349.  The Go actually has a charging dock.  So it's got battery.  You can carry it around.  It's a 10 inch screen, 1200 by 800.  It can be used as a portable speaker.  But of course, the main point of these Portal devices is for video conversations.  So and what's interesting and I didn't realize this.  We got the original Portal.  It's out in them.  I keep trying to give it away.  Nobody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I notice it keeps getting closer and closer to the studio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put it at the front door.  Somebody put it away.  That's not...  I don't want Facebook in my house.  You know, I don't mind Amazon in my house.  I don't mind Google in my house.  Facebook, that's a road bridge too far.  The new Portals do have built-in lens covers.  And there are buttons at the top to disconnect the camera and the microphone.  One of the things they did do very well in the original Portal and they still do well.  It's a very high res camera 12 megapixels, but it's got an ultra wide lens on it.  So what they can do is zoom in.  Everybody's starting to do this now.  Apple's starting to do it.  I know it works in my nest when I do a duo call.  They zoom in.  It's called smart camera technology and it follows you around the room.  It pans and zooms to keep you in frame.  Apparently the microphone and the speakers in this also do something similar.  So as you move around your callers can still hear you clearly.  And more importantly, maybe because this is obviously designed for Facebook Messenger and Messenger video.  They're also adding support for other video conferencing technologies, which makes this a little bit more desirable including zoom.  Let me see if they do Google meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not for you, but it's shaping out to be a nice product.  Yeah, go to meeting, BlueJeans, WebEx and Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like they're trying to get this into small businesses more than people.  Like they're pretty because they have the pro version that's a little more expensive and fancier.  So I wonder again if if I were a business, but I don't know.  $349 for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's for the pro.  Yeah.  And so this is like I haven't had any firsthand experience with these devices.  It is primarily video conferencing because I'm used to seeing these these kinds of devices and like, you know,  Google's Nest Hub.  Yeah, you can video conference on it, but it's also, you know, an assistant portal portal.  No pun intended.  No reference intended.  But yeah, I mean it does all these other things.  Is this primarily just like a clock on your home screen and it's got a calendar.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's mostly for video calling.  I mean, it's it's an interface to Facebook.  Facebook.  If you're in a Facebook group, you can use it for that Messenger rooms.  There's Spotify so you can play music on it.  But I completely agree with you.  I don't know why you would prefer unless you're all in on the Facebook ecosystem seems like a nest would a nest hub would be much better or an Echo show would be much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Echo show they have the Echo show 10, which is the one that actually has the rotating body that the original that's so weird.  That's actually that's $250.  The original portal is not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It did not move the new Echo show has a servo that moves the camera.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the portal.  It was that same thing.  It was super wide and you would without following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  I think there's actually a really interesting thing happening.  So if you look at iOS 1515, one of the things that's now out, I believe is you can send me web links to your FaceTime calls and I can get them on my pixel, which is, you know, something that they promised to never delivered.  So I think there's a big rush right now for obvious reasons to get into accessible video calling for everyone and to have a dog in that hunt.  And so I think it makes sense that Facebook's adding more to this, even if it doesn't really make sense that Facebook would want to have this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, if you're a business and you use WebEx or Zoom, which most businesses do right or go to meeting.  Your calendar is on the screen.  You tap it.  The portal plus is a 14 inch screen.  It's a very big screen.  So you could even have it in a conference room, I think and tap it.  And now you're in a video conference.  I could see why you might add that.  But again, if I'm a business, just the name Facebook on the front is going to turn me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think.  Well, I don't know.  Some businesses may feel that way, but a lot of people that's how they drive their businesses.  The Facebook platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of normal mom and pop shops.  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I go to a local store and I go to their website and it's basically right in this place.  I just on Facebook and you're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  okay, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sorry, that was that was a little excessive there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of it, but it's but that's the reality.  They must sell them because they keep working on them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my curiosity.  He's now retired.  But his bulk of business came from Facebook referrals.  He was doing computer repair stuff and he did it for several years and he had a website.  He understood the value of a website and proper SEO and things of that nature.  But Facebook was his jam and he tried to get me on it years ago and did nothing for me.  But works for him.  So I bet it brother.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon has announced a new Kindle lineup.  Just you know,  I you could thank me because I just bought a Kobo and  of course Amazon immediately announced the new paper whites 6.8 inch screen.  That's nice.  Although my I got the Kobo with the 8 inch screen.  So I'm a little bit bigger screen USB.  See, I'm very jealous because that is a much better way to charge.  They've had up to now.  It's been that Mike horrible micro USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the only thing I charge on a micro USB now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  So it's time one charger time.  They did that two-year worry-free guarantee warranty.  You could preorder today ships on October 27th.  I guess that's that's the whole thing.  The paper white has a really good screen.  I have I have one of those.  I also have an Oasis.  So I'm kind of a Kindle fan.  That's why I thought I'd try it with with a Kobo ad supported version 139.99.  They just you just get an ad on the start screen.  It's not pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the ads on my Amazon.  Sorry my husband like I thought I would hate it.  They're the cheesiest freaking books.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a Navy SEAL.  She's a Scottish heiress together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're forced to work and they hate each other.  Beach in another international foreign mystery romance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gonna fall in love.  It's waterproof, which I think is a nice feature.  That's why I got the Kobo because I could take a bath with it.  And you get four months of Kindle unlimited for free when you purchase it with ads 160 bucks.  The signature edition has more storage Kindle paper white 8 gigs Kindle paper white signature edition has 32 gigs  and that by the way is a massive amount of storage for e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah for e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean unless you're doing like graphic novels.  Yeah, I mean I think I have like 2,000 books on my Kindle and I am nowhere near the storage cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just only reason I wanted to try the Kobo which is by the way owned by Rakuten now.  That's right, which is a little odd is because I was very interested in the fact that you can it supports  Overdrive which is the library software that a lot of public libraries use.  I was able to sign up with the Sonoma County Library online and even have to go into the library.  I'll never see a library and I can get books and audiobooks free.  They're just like library books.  So you have to you know, send them back.  They they they return automatically after a period of time and you have to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can manage that all through the Kobo itself because I use an app called Libby.  Right.  Yeah, I was going to say.  Kind of thing, but then I have to send it through and sending it through to my Kindle sometimes involves me  like then logging into my Amazon account on my phone.  It's by no means like a single, you know button device on the on the Kindle itself.  So that would actually be pretty cool to have it integrated like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll give you I'll do a little review when it comes out because  you know, that's that's what interested me on it.  Also the waterproof, although now the Kindle immediately after I ordered this came out with a waterproof version.  But and it also does portrait as well as I mean landscape as well as portrait, which I think might be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be interesting for novels and how like I have a couple books that are terrible on the Kindle.  Right.  Like cookbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mmm.  Yeah, anything with illustrations.  I have some chess books.  You know when you're when you're looking studying chess in a book,  they have diagrams of the board and on some of them the production is so screwed up that the diagram is this is tiny.  You can't and you can't zoom it.  It's not like you so you're like this useless.  I can't I can't even read it.  So we'll see.  Kobo that you have to buy through the Kobo store if you want to buy books.  But since it supports the library and supports EPUB and it supports Dropbox.  I put all my I have a lot of books that I bought, you know from various publishers in EPUB format,  not the Kindle proprietary Kindle format so I could put those on here so that it'll work out pretty well.  It's a little more expensive than the Amazon.  I think the Amazon is somewhat subsidized by Amazon.  Just a bit just a little bit just a little bit just to corner the market on those ebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I will say if you if you want to feel angry at Amazon,  look at what they're doing with libraries and Libby in the kerfuffle that's happened that the  what's going on has Libby.  Well as Libby has made it much easier for people to borrow ebooks from their library.  Amazon is actually starting to make it so some of the books that are published under their imprint  their ebooks published under their ebook publishing imprint don't go to libraries.  They're just like screw it.  We're not giving it to you.  Yeah, it's pretty mean.  The major publishers are already doing windowing and they're making shorter.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a story from March.  Yeah, that's too bad.  You know, that's I it's kind of funny because we just have this long tradition of libraries  buying a few copies of a book keeping it in the library for people to get for free.  And I think the notion of free public library is is a is definitely a societal good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Essential to the democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so because not everybody can afford to buy a book when digital came along.  It became a little bit more complicated.  I you know, so I'm looking on overdrive, which is the software this Sonoma County Library  uses and I wanted to read Isaac Asimov's Foundation.  I don't happen to have a copy.  I read it when I was in high school and you know, it's coming out on Apple TV plus this month.  So I looked and said that well, we have three copies and they're all out and it's a six month  way. It's it's just exactly like the or six week wait.  It's just exactly like the library.  They have a limited number even though they're digital and they could in theory have infinite  copies, but that's that's how they've handled it is to make it just like it's a real book.  I think that seems fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it does.  Okay.  So the other part the other governing thing is they can only when they do this there's  two types of windowing when you buy a digital copy.  You can only lend it out X number of times.  So then they have to buy a new copy because a real book would wear out after a global.  Yeah, I'm not I'm just saying that that's part of the deal.  And then the other part is there's a time constraint on some of them now too.  So this is a problem if you want it like Foundation maybe not because it's super popular,  right?  People are always going to want to borrow that but some books that are maybe less popular  they'll go out of the time limit for lending those books out even if they haven't been  number limit and so like I encounter this when I find you know, if you're if you're  looking for a new sci-fi trilogy as I want to do sometimes like you'll be like, oh,  there's a third the second and third.  So where's the first and it'll be out of window.  Oh, frustrating like I mean and then you can go to Amazon and buy it but you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, I have to think that it doesn't really cost authors or publishers much to  support libraries and there's such a benefit in society.  I would hope Amazon would rethink its its stance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it probably does cost some like a loss of sales.  Yeah, I read probably two to three books a week.  And so I wouldn't I obviously would not buy that many books in my life.  But and I buy books by authors.  I like I buy books like if new authors, especially diverse authors.  I'm trying really hard to spend actual money on buying their books.  But I do read more than if because I have access very easy access to those books.  I still would go to the library and pick them up otherwise.  But I do think there's probably a overall loss in sales.  But I also do it because ebooks are really expensive for what I feel like I'm getting right.  They are paying $12 for a digital copy of a book feels kind of like highway robbery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes libraries also offer movies digital for download audiobooks for free.  You should check your local library and see what software they support.  I think it's Libyan Overdriver the two biggest right?  You could read newspapers.  Yeah, magazines newspapers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you go into the physical library a lot of libraries are doing like CNC.  They have like little electronics making stations.  Some libraries have like sewing machines.  It's actually a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so smart.  And it's not free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We pay for it with our taxes.  I mean you should use them because you're paying for them and you should value them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my first job was in a library.  I was an intern at a library when I was 13 and 14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worked in a library in college.  It was one of my college jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did too.  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worked in a movie theater.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're more modern than the rest of us.  That's all.  Oh, kid.  That's all.  Let's see.  It's too bad Jeff's not here because there's so many good Facebook stories.  Let's not talk about these Facebook stories.  Let's just ignore them.  Let's just ignore them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm happy to ignore them.  I feel like the last couple of weeks especially it's just been yeah, what other bad thing did Facebook supposedly do?  And it's exhausting at a certain point.  And it doesn't impact me personally because I'm not on Facebook anymore.  But that's why I'm not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or WhatsApp?  Wait, wait, wait.  Because like people are like, are you on WhatsApp or Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you are on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like a lot of people are like self-righteously like I ditched my Facebook account five years ago because they're evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so true.  It's so true.  It's a pretty hypocritical place to be.  I don't know.  Why is there a difference then?  Because I feel like there's a difference for me on a personal level because when I stepped away from Facebook, I did it for a very particular like one very particular reason, which was that when I used Facebook, I didn't feel good.  That's exactly it.  I would read through my feed and you know, this person that I that I know and love would suddenly get into a conversation with this person that I know and love that they didn't know and love each other.  And now suddenly they're yelling at each other about something.  I'm just like, why?  Why?  I don't want to I don't want to be the reason that this happens.  And I don't want to read it because it makes me feel like crap.  And that's the main reason that I stepped away from Facebook and then all this other, you know, data privacy and all that other aspect kind of came came to light as well that kind of added on to it.  But that was my primary reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, the big crisis crisis that is not the word.  The big issue from a governmental standpoint is Facebook when they bought these companies said they would not combine their back ends.  So for a while actually cutting out Facebook and still being part of these was fine because they weren't sharing data, etc.  Yeah, but Facebook then integrated those things and now they are basically the same company doing the same evil that Facebook is doing in some ways.  And, you know, last week's story we talked about Instagram does make people feel bad sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't even I as soon as I killed Facebook, it was like a burden lifted from my shoulders and I don't even care about Facebook news.  And obviously I should because I'm I am a minority that's left Facebook.  But to answer your question, I do I agree 100% with you, Jason.  The reason I left is because it didn't make me feel good.  I do have an Instagram account, but that's not it's mostly just so that I can show Instagram here because if you don't have an account Instagram really limits what you can do.  You can't zoom in on the picture.  You can't you know, you can't do too many pictures.  So a lot of our hosts post stuff.  I just posted a picture on Instagram and I just showed you but mostly I don't and I never had a WhatsApp account.  So I kind of like not being in that Facebook universe.  Nevertheless, there is Facebook news.  The latest is the markup, which is publication at the markup.org nonprofit has found evidence that Facebook is changing the news feed.  They're actually changing the website code to foil automated data collection of news feed posts.  Groups like NYU's ad observatory scrape Facebook to keep an eye on what's happening at scale.  You can't you know, you have to do this in an automated fashion.  So Facebook is doing this thing is really it's blatant.  They're attaching junk code to accessibility features.  Which it breaks both browser based ad blocking services, which may be the real reason they're doing it.  But also it harms people who are visually impaired because the alt tags that they're looking to use are now full of crap.  And by adding these tags and they're actually an ARIA they're in the ARIA tags.  So you don't see it in the browser.  But screen reader software uses not the alt tags.  The ARIA tags screen reader software uses it.  But organizations like NYU's ad observatory also use it to identify sponsored posts.  So Facebook says, well, we constantly make code changes across our services,  but we did not make any code changes to block these research projects to which I'll add.  That was just a happy side effect.  Laura Edelson, who's a PhD candidate in computer science at NYU and the founder of the ad observatory project said,  expressed dismay at Facebook's move because it caused a sharp drop in the amount of data collected.  A fix was found that allowed the team to collect data at normal levels.  She said, I think it's unfortunate that Facebook is continuing to fight with researchers rather than work with them.  And that's kind of a constant drumbeat in the last few weeks.  We've talked about that last week, which is that Facebook doesn't really want researchers to pay attention to see into what Facebook's doing.  And I think it's we agreed last week that's something Facebook has to allow because we can't trust them to self-report.  They need to have allow researchers to keep an eye on things, not to bust Facebook, but to see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, it still turns into, hey, are you trying to regulate me?  Well, Facebook don't regulate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's their platform.  You know, it's their platform.  What can you say?  Six takeaways from Stacy Higginbotham from this week's work with event.  What was your work with?  What was the works with event, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's surprising.  Okay.  That was a, I know that site.  IOT conference hosted last week by Silicon Labs.  And they're a chip company that makes all the underlying radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put you to sleep with a Facebook story, didn't I admit it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You totally did.  No, I just, I was just like, what?  I changed the subject.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so bored.  I was expecting something totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought we were going to talk about Google.  Oh, we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm saving the best for last.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey.  No, no, I'm saving the best for first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me bring you a shovel there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cannot help doing this with you, Stacy.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Must be Freudian.  Okay, go ahead.  It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  So the six takeaways.  The ones you all most care about.  There was actually, and this is so nerdy, but I'm going to do it because security is so important.  Silicon Labs announced their custom parts manufacturing something.  I don't have the story in front of me.  Oh, I do.  I can read it to you.  It's like the second bullet point.  What is it?  Custom part manufacturing service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CPMF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a big deal.  What they're doing is if you are a client of their chips, you can log in through a web portal  and they attach individual device IDs to your individual chips at manufacture.  This is going to help with things like preventing counterfeiting.  This is going to help with, you can actually occlude who makes your chips.  So you could actually, if you're doing components for Apple, normally your chip says your name on it,  but you could actually have, or Silicon Labs name on it, but you could actually have it say something else to help hide who made that part.  And from a security standpoint, it's awesome because it is going to ensure the supply chain from the very beginning of the supply chain.  No one else is going to be able to tamper with that chip.  All the certificates, all the IDs, all of that's going to be implanted individually on the chip, not at a batch level,  but on each individual chip at manufacture.  It's freaking awesome and no one else is doing this.  And it's something I've actually talked with.  California has a law and for a while the chip manufacturers were worried that they were going to have to do this.  And I was like, oh God, it's going to be so expensive.  And it turns out that they kind of punted and were like, yeah, we don't need to just secure everything at the individual device level,  but it is a best practice and Silicon Labs is pushing this forward.  Their people have to pay for it.  Their customers have to pay for it, but they should because it's going to be a big deal.  I think we're going to see more of that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they make a lot of the chips in IoT devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do. They make a lot of it.  They own. So they're the only people right now who make Zigbee chip, sorry, Z-Wave chips.  Oh, okay.  They are only, they divested themselves of their automotive industry business earlier this year.  They sold it for like three billion dollars to go all in on IoTs.  They make Wi-Fi chips, Zigbee, Z-Wave.  They're big behind the matter standard.  They make Thread, radios.  They make a lot of sub gigahertz chips.  So for like Wison, Loro, Amazon Sidewalk, they make the chips there.  So there's tons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aren't they big in a lot of the maker space?  A lot of the little gadgets and things that the maker community puts together just for hobby robots and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, I always associate that with Broadcom because there's a Broadcom chip in the pie.  But sure. I mean, they make radios.  They're big businesses radios.  They have microcontrollers and stuff that help control the radios and they do some modules.  But their big thing is just radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bluetooth radios.  I forgot Bluetooth, but they make those too.  Anyway, so I love them because they're great for IoT.  You can see all sorts of cool things happening.  So in one of those is like sub gigahertz radios being a big deal.  I don't know what the other takeaways are.  I cannot remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, it's so fascinating because probably most of our listeners have never heard of Silicon Labs.  And yet probably all of our listeners have devices with Silicon Labs chips in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you 100% do.  They're inside phones.  They're inside Nest thermostat.  They're everywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so and many of these devices are insecure or potentially insecure.  So this is actually much more important than we realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see a lot of the like the Bluetooth attacks.  Like some of them rely there.  There are a few supply chain attacks on radios that matter.  But ultimately, I think this is a good example of someone in the industry stepping up in offering a service that is needed not just on radios, but for everything.  And I think other companies will follow through with or follow on with this and offer the same thing once they see it's possible and people buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You hosted a panel on medical.  Is it medical IoT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, medical devices.  Devices.  Yeah, for like how IoT is changing the medical industry in a post-COVID world.  Are they going to put one in my chest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a place for IoT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't do that just yet, to be honest.  And if I did, I would make sure the radio is manufactured with the custom parts manufacturing service.  Just because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just did something.  Lisa and I just did something on Monday that I'm, Kevin Rose told me about and recommended.  And now I have some, a little bit of misgiving speaking of medical procedures.  We did a, we both did a full body MRI scan.  Scan, yeah.  Yeah.  This is the company's pre-Nuvo.  And doctors think it's a terrible idea.  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was supposed to say, do you know that's the joke every doctor makes?  They're like, oh yeah, put them through an MRI scan and see everything wrong with it.  And like 98% of the stuff is totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem is, and if you see a spot on somebody's lung, you can't ignore it.  Even though most of the time it's meaningless, right?  So I now have some misgivings.  I haven't yet seen the results of the scans.  But, you know, I listened to Kevin.  We did it for a good reason.  Lisa's had a chronic issue that's been bugging the hell out of her.  It's not, you know, life threatening.  But she wants to get it solved.  And so I did it kind of as a supportive spouse.  I said, well, let's do it together.  But also because I'm of an age where, you know, if they can spot cancer at an early stage,  it'd probably be a good thing.  But then I read up on it and doctors say, no, no, you should never do this because you're going to see stuff  that's not consequential, but you can't ignore now that you know it.  What is that liver spot, that mass you have in your liver there?  Is that anything to be concerned about?  Oh, probably not. Let's just ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was just that rib eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.  Anyway, you made me think of it when have you ever done an MRI?  Holy cow.  I love them.  You love them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You love them?  Best sleep I've ever had in my life was the two times I've had MRIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did they do your whole body?  So a whole body, it's an hour.  You're in there for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was maybe half an hour for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're looking at a bone injury or something, they'll just do that region.  The thing is noisy as hell.  I asked them, I said, that's just a side effect.  We're pumping so much energy through your body that the metal and everything creaks and moans.  Really? Really?  So that's the metal responding to the energy that's coming through my body.  Yeah.  Wow.  Really? I thought it was the magnet rotating.  Well, some of it's positioning, but there's also quite a bit of metal stress noise.  There's clanking and clonking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like the best white noise for me.  And then they swaddle you up like a newborn baby.  You're in a tube.  It's true.  I looked forward to it and was out.  You are so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't.  I mean, I know people who freak.  They ask you, are you claustrophobic?  Because I mean, you're in a pretty small tube.  But I was pleased that it didn't scare me.  And I did kind of nap towards the end, but because it's boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do VR headsets for them.  Like there's a whole study of people doing VR to help with the claustrophobia.  I thought I was so claustrophobic.  I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I felt like I was in a science fiction movie.  You know, it's this brightly lit white room with technicians and you know, they're all hooded up and stuff.  You get in this machine and it's going shhh.  It felt very cold.  It's cold.  There's wind blowing on you.  It's very science.  You feel like you're in a sci-fi movie.  Anyway, it's like the alien probing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how you sleep through that.  It's not like that's like a constant noise like, no, it's not.  Like it's it's like very random.  It's a leaps of all different frequencies.  I know.  I don't know.  It tells on you.  What are you talking about?  You sleep through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, you're talking about the guy that has the weird sleep habits anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was so tired.  He just went right out.  All you need is an MRI machine at home.  Yeah, every time Ann has trouble sleeping, we just give it an MRI.  It goes right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every night, get an MRI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did.  They put headphones on me.  I would have liked a VR headset.  That would have been kind of cool.  Yeah, I agree.  I was a little disappointed.  The quality of the headphones was terrible.  Because I had heard that Audis, who makes the best very, very high end headphones,  Audisi, Audisi, A-U-D-E-Z-E, Audisi.  I had heard they made also made headphones for MRI machines.  I thought, oh, I'm going to get some nice sound.  Apparently, they don't make the best headphones for the MRI machines.  And then I made the mistake of asking for country music.  So that was that was probably a problem.  Why did you do that?  All I hear is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was not fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not sleep.  Anyway, anything else from the the IoT event?  Batteries are still a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know that.  Oh, I was excited.  Oh, y'all check out Dracula Technologies.  Not only are they making a slightly more dense PV sensor.  A PV energy harvester.  So photovoltaic cell for a sensor that you can pop a sensor,  put the sticker on top of it and it will run without a battery for like 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's like a little mini solar panel.  It's a solar panel sticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're making it of a material that can be recycled.  Before I was like, that's pretty cool.  And then I was like, I must talk to them.  So I'm really excited.  Also, they have a cool name, Dracula Technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they're sucking the sun's energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The energy out of the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can they make them bigger?  Could they generate enough power to...  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  That's magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I love the logo too.  It's like a little bat.  That's cool.  I know.  Look at that.  That's hysterical.  You know, this is why we love having you on Stacey.  Because you have...  You know, this is stuff that is so infrastructure.  We don't pay attention to it.  And yet it is so influential in everything we do.  This is cool.  Yeah, y'all should look up Scylla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the new whoop band ant?  With the new battery that's like extra dense and...  No, I didn't.  Smaller?  Oh my God.  Hold on.  This is really exciting for a tech infrastructure.  And it will stop being pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, whoop, whoop, which has the best name ever, is a fitness band, right?  Whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoop 4.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's smaller and thinner because it has a new battery technology.  And that battery technology is basically more energy dense.  So you can do more with less.  And it's from a company that was started in 2011 from Georgia Tech called Scylla.  And this is going to be the hotness in wearables.  Because basically you could either make your devices smaller or keep them the same size  and have them run for longer or do more.  And when I say batteries are still a problem, that's what I'm talking about.  So this is really cool because we don't have a lot of new material science.  Those things don't come along very often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yay.  Okay, I googled whoop and Scylla and I came out with the wrong...  How do you spell Scylla?  It's S-I-L-A.  Oh, I was spelling it like Scylla and Charybdis.  Scylla nanotechnologies.  See, this is a perfect example.  Are we making breakthroughs in battery chemistry?  Because that's been one of the things that's held back everything.  Everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.  This isn't a change in battery chemistry.  It's a change in how much energy they can store.  There are breakthroughs happening.  But the hard thing is, I mean, think about this.  This was 10 years ago that they discovered this.  So commercialization for material science.  It takes a long time.  This actually, I feel like, actually happened really fast.  But yeah, it takes a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the battery, the Scylla battery is 17% higher energy density.  Which sounds like not a lot, but that can make a huge difference.  But it took them 10 years to get to market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I mean, these are...  It's incremental, but the cool thing is when you don't...  The IoT has so many different types of devices that require different levels of power.  So when you're talking about a computer, a 17% increase may not matter that much.  But when you're talking about a wearable, it can actually give you like a whole extra day's battery life.  Which is a lot.  Or smaller devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they talk about the chip shortage at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did talk.  They had a whole panel on the chip shortage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You read my article and you're just helping me out here.  I love you, Leo. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I wrote this a week ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That man's a pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's something we're all interested in though, because it's still impacting everything.  Absolutely.  Cars to laptops.  And phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's still going on.  Nothing really new to report.  They're saying, what, 20...  Did I say 2023 in there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so we're still on that timeframe.  They talked about...  There's just a fundamental breaking point in the industry that is pretty subtle.  But like, you know how we talk about all the new fabs and we get all excited about Samsung building fabs and Intels?  Those are all on really big 300 millimeter wafers.  This is my 300 millimeter wafer.  And all the automotive chips have been made on these smaller 200 millimeter wafers.  So there's been this whole industry designed around...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have vanilla wafer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's about that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the issue is a lot of the automotive companies, they've been stuck on this 200 millimeter technology.  A lot of the MEMS sensors that we depend on for IoT and even manufacturing,  all of that stuff that translates the analog world into digital is on this older technology,  but no one's really investing in it.  And then all of a sudden we're like, hey, let's do the Internet of Things.  Let's build electric cars.  And then suddenly we all want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So that's a big shift.  That took them by surprise.  They didn't expect that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no one wants to build those factories anymore because there's no economies of scale there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're legacy nodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're legacy.  So the car manufacturers need to step up and be like, all right, we need to get in on 300 millimeters,  which means their chips are going to be more expensive.  Not necessarily.  And they don't need to be that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're wasting precious silicon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not anymore.  Because now there's sufficient demand for them.  So the reason you would...  Oh, my Internet connection just went unstable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, you froze momentarily, but you're all right now.  You're good now.  Are you on the fiber still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't plug it in today.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  You don't like us that much, do you?  Do you plug it in for TOEFL?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't plug it in.  Hold on.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm teasing.  I don't care.  Oh, now she's going to go plug.  When I do the next break, if you want to plug it in, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll plug it in then.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She plugs it in for TOEFL.  I guarantee you.  I did not plug it in this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I plugged it in for my event yesterday.  Okay.  Why do you even unplug it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you leave it always plugged in?  Because I'll trip over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a solution for that.  There must be.  What?  It's worth it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's worth it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Punch a hole in the wall, run it through the wall.  I don't know.  You don't need to have wire going across the desk.  Yeah, I understand.  And the fiber thing's back there.  Shocking.  There's a fix for that.  Get a longer cable.  That's what you need.  You can run along the wall.  Oh, y'all.  Oh, y'all.  I don't know what I was talking about anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can take the woman out of Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Burke is screaming at the screen right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll send Burke up there to wire you up.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Taking time out.  We're going to take a time out.  We'll come back.  Got a lot more to talk about.  Jeff Jarvis is out for the day, but it's so nice to have Jason Howell here from All About  Android, Hands-on Photography.  I'm sorry.  That's somebody else.  That'd be Tech News Weekly is that show that you do.  Yes, sir.  There we go.  Hands-on Photography's Mr. Ant Pruitt.  He's also community manager at Club Twit and Stacey Higginbotham, who plugs it in for  TOEFL, but not for us.  I thought it's not true.  She does a show with Kevin TOEFL called the IoT Show.  It's really, really good.  Our show today, actually, it's kind of fun.  Both our sponsors today are podcasts.  This says something about the podcast, I guess.  My good friend Kevin Rose, who is a brilliant, brilliant guy and has a real knack for finance  and making money.  He's a partner at True Ventures right now, but he's well known as one of the top 25 angel  investors.  Actually, Bloomberg called him that.  The magazine called him one of the top 25 most influential people on the web.  Founder of Digg, Digg Nation.  He was a dark tipper on the screensavers and he's done some great podcasts.  His newest is all about finance.  It's called Modern Finance.  If you're trying to keep up with that crazy world of crypto, the crazy crypto world,  bitcoins, NFTs, robo investors, decentralized finance, you'll want to know about Modern  Finance.  He's a great show for the novice and expert alike.  I've never listened to a better show for helping me understand the very complicated  notions behind all of this stuff.  For instance, in fact, it was his very first episode.  I loved it.  He talked all about NFTs.  It's the first time I ever understood what NFTs are.  But he does it without dumbing it down.  Tech experts are on, entrepreneurs, artists creating NFTs.  He interviews the top experts in the field.  In fact, he does two shows, which is great.  One, the Consensus episode every week explores weekly news, distills it into digestible  information.  The other, also every week, deeper interviews with individual crypto founders and NFT artists.  So, this is a great opportunity to catch up on a topic that's changing rapidly, but also  has deep impact for everything we do.  Plus, it makes you the life of the party if you know about crypto.  Everybody's saying, what do you think of this new NFT thing?  Get informed about your investments.  Learn about the next big thing in crypto or NFTs.  Ten years ago, people called cryptocurrency a scam.  Five years ago, people thought it was a fad.  Now, it's already a trillion dollar market and growing the Modern Finance podcast helps  you make sense.  Of all the coins, the NFTs, the chaos, equip yourself with the knowledge of where things  are going with our good friend and probably one of the best guys in the world to explain  all of this, Kevin Rose.  Look, the financial landscape is harder than ever to navigate, but you're not doing it  alone.  Download and subscribe to Modern Finance wherever you listen to podcasts.  That's Modern Finance.  You'll find it in Apple's podcast, Google's podcast, every podcast player.  And of course, you can find out more at modern.finance on the web.  Don't be the last person on the next train out.  Listen to Modern Finance and get ahead of the future of finance.  After this show is over, I strongly encourage you to download the latest episode and listen.  You will learn something that's really, and it's quite entertaining, quite fun.  I do love Kevin Rose.  Modern Finance, wherever you get your podcasts.  So interesting debate going on about, remember we, for a while, blocked Huawei.  The country of Lithuania has now said, throw away Chinese mobile phones, particularly Xiaomi phones,  because they found the devices had built in censorship capabilities.  They could actually turn on a thing that would disable, for instance, posts about Tiananmen Square  or pictures of President Xi that the president didn't like.  Built into the phone that you bought in Lithuania.  Yikes.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it Chinese surveillance or was it somebody else's?  Yeah, no, it was Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that the, I think my suspicion is that they're just put in by default into these phones.  This was particularly Xiaomi, but I mean the Chinese government has control over this.  And this was intended obviously not for Lithuanians, but since it's in the phone,  there was some concern that it could be used against Lithuanians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, ScooterX is pointing out that Xiaomi's statement denies the allegation that the company intended to do that.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However.  They did not deny that it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  We comply with the GDPR.  But the software's in there.  That's the point.  They didn't deny it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  149 terms, apparently more than 449 terms that could be censored.  Things like long live Taiwan independence, free Tibet.  Halongong.  Things like that.  Uyghurs.  Wow.  Yeah, no good.  Let's see.  And not isolated to the Xiaomi phones that are sold in China is my understanding either.  Well, that's the point.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Xiaomi does not sell phones in the United States, nor does Huawei, right?  But I had a Xiaomi phone.  I really liked it.  In fact, I've had a Huawei phone.  Xiaomi.  They're very good phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Xiaomi sells.  They sell them here?  Xiaomi sells IoT devices.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The MeCams and all that.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Tuya is one of the big providers of what are you calling it?  Like branded IoT.  Like Energizer has a few IoT devices.  Tuya makes the backend software and hosts their stuff in the cloud.  Now Tuya says that their cloud is geographic.  They have geographic regions and data sharing does not happen between regions.  But some senators last week or two weeks ago actually were like, hey, Tuya, we should sanction those guys.  We should not allow their stuff in, which is a big deal because like Walmart stuff is built on Tuya.  OK, sorry.  Since we're talking about it, I have to put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lithuania's National Cybersecurity Center said it found four major cybersecurity risks for devices made by Huawei and Xiaomi,  including two relating to pre-installed apps, one involving personal data leakage,  and as a result warned against use of these two brands.  Voice of America was one of the banned censored phrases.  Long live Taiwan independence.  Can you buy it?  I feel like you can still buy Xiaomi phones in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you can if you're ordering online through.  Right.  You have to obviously you can't get them in carriers.  You're not going to walk into a carrier store and buy a Xiaomi phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Department of Commerce has warned against them.  That was years ago.  That was several years ago.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's same same with Huawei devices.  I thought they still buy Huawei devices as well.  It's just highly discouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We neglected to mention this on Sunday on Twitter.  I want to mention it now.  Clive Sinclair has passed away.  You may not know the name, but there are a lot of people, certainly of my generation,  who used Sinclair's early personal computers like the ZX Spectrum,  which was how Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, got started in computing when he was a teenager.  There's a Sinclair ZX Spectrum.  I had an early time.  Was it a Timex Sinclair?  The ZX80.  You remember that one?  They were inexpensive.  They were, you know, about 100 bucks.  They weren't very powerful.  But for many people, this was the first experience they had of a small personal computer.  He was also famous for designing the first pocket calculator.  British guy.  And so the ZX was most popular in the UK.  But I think it was time.  Am I right that it was Timex that brought it to the United States?  I think so.  I can't remember.  The Timex Sinclair ZX81.  That's the one I had a little membrane keyboard.  See, there you go.  Yes.  Remember that?  Membrane keyboard.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend had the, I didn't have one of these, but my friend when I was a kid did.  His father had a bunch of, you know, at the time, the computers of the time.  And I remember going over to his house and nerding out on the ZX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not super powerful.  But at least, you know, an exposure.  But it was pretty sweet at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if that was about 100 bucks, what was, I don't remember what those TRS80s and things like that cost.  Oh, much more expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much more expensive.  TRS80 maybe was a thousand or 800 bucks.  There were though things like the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64 that were less expensive.  Or 500.  But people went out and bought VIC-20s and they were so underpowered and so useless, they just ended up collecting dust in the closet.  I mean, they, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they turn those into speaking spells?  Because that's what it looked like.  Yeah, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the ZX was sold as a kit as well.  You could buy it assembled, I think.  But you could also solder it yourself.  July 1982, the TS-1000 was sold in the United States.  The first computer under 100 bucks.  IBM personal computer hadn't come out, had come out the year before.  The Macintosh wouldn't come out for two more years.  So it was kind of Apple II, IBM PC era.  But those were all very, very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the TRS was roughly a thousand.  You'd say the C64 may have been maybe 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, I have to ask somebody who bought it back in that time.  The C64 was cheaper, I'm pretty sure.  It was definitely cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the Commodore 64, that was my computer.  I saw a lot of those.  I was saying that growing up.  But I can't remember.  You know, like I don't think I bought it.  My parents bought it for me.  That's what we don't know.  The sixth grade.  I don't know.  I'm guessing somewhere around 500 bucks.  $595, according to Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The VIC-20 was a lot less.  And that was the problem.  It was only 5K of RAM.  So you really couldn't do a lot.  Actually, I think the Sinclair only had 1K of RAM.  So, you know, it was for hobbyists in the early days.  Times have come a long way.  We really have.  Anyway, Clive Sinclair, dead at the age of 81.  And maybe a name you don't know, but he certainly was a big part of the personal computer revolution.  Certainly as important as Wozniak and Jobs.  Timex said they sold 600,000 of them.  I'm just looking through Google images, ZX81 games, and just remembering the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Monster Maze, 3D Monster Maze.  I'm just reminded of how much more we had to use our imagination.  Our imagination really filled the gaps then.  Now everything is created to this sharpness that replicates reality.  But back then, I mean, it was a lot, obviously a lot more rudimentary.  And there was just something magical about filling in the gaps with your own imagination.  Like it was just what we had.  We probably took it for granted.  But looking back, that's the thing I miss is just like, I don't know.  There's just something about that era of games that I love.  This is 3D Monster Maze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like there could be a market for recreating some of these games.  Oh, there is.  Like that on a phone, you know, or something.  Oh, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would never give up today's gaming.  I mean, God, some of those things are freaking beautiful.  And you're just like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, works of art.  Doesn't Mr. Technologizer have some games like this available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wrote a game in a basic.  He was talking about this on Twitter on Sunday, Harry McCracken.  And he wrote a game.  Let me actually could show you his website because you could play it.  Arctic 81.  Arctic 81.com.  I think that's it.  Yes, it is.  There it is.  And he actually has it.  You can play it online at Arctic 81.com.  I love the website because it really looks like that era.  I will describe your surroundings at the top of the screen.  Tell me what you want to do.  Mostly two word commands like go west, get brick inventory, help, save and exit.  You ready to play?  All right.  You are an igloo.  Obvious exits out.  You see shovel, warm coat.  Your command.  Take, let's do get.  Get coat.  Thinking.  Good.  You see shovel.  Get shovel.  I bet we'll need that too.  It's the old, the old.  Okay.  You see nothing special.  Oh, let's go out.  I'm now leaving the igloo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is when I would fail because I would say leave.  Go west.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you had to play these games.  You would kind of learn that you can't.  Learn to syntax.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  Yes.  They're stupid.  And this is written in basic.  The thing is Harry actually had a typo.  It was published in a book and would not run if you had typed it in from the book page after  page of this code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine?  It probably took forever to type that in and you get to the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I, you know, when I was a kid, kid, I was in my 20s, but in the early days of Atari,  you know, you'd buy Compute magazine and you'd type in long listings.  And if you made a mistake, you know, you'd have to find it.  And of course you couldn't save it to a floppy disk.  You had to save it to a tape.  Tape is cassette, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, cassette tape.  Memories of that myself.  Spending a lot of time punching in just numbers, machine code.  I have new respect for you, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know you went that far back.  That's good.  Yeah.  We read, remember last week we read the ignoble prize winners.  Oh boy.  I didn't realize this.  They had a broadcast of their prize winners, you know, presentation like you do with the  Academy Awards of the Emmys.  It was pulled down on YouTube because they had the temerity to feature a 1914, yes,  1914 recorder of a tenor singing Fenniculee Fennicula.  Of course, anything from 1914 is in public domain.  That didn't stop YouTube from taking it down at the behest of SME in grooves on behalf  of Emerald Wise Music Group, BMG Rights Management, LLC, UMPG Publishing, PEDL,  Cobalt Music, Warner Chappelle, Sony ATV, and One Music Rights Society.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not cool.  Was it for the recording?  I mean, is that different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's content ID, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what do you want them to do?  They're probably sitting at the desk listening to these things, you know, personally over  and over to make sure they pass and say, okay, this is approved or let the AI do what it's  potentially doing very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They solved it today.  It's back up.  It's been down for the week.  Still unsuccessful at making any contact with any human being at YouTube, they say.  We think we solved the problem by recording our own performance of Fenniculee Fennicula  and then editing that into the video.  Instead, the new musical performances by soprano Maria Ferrante.  It's probably better, right?  Probably.  Yeah.  So now if you want, you can watch the 31st annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony featuring.  Wait a minute.  If I play this, YouTube is going to take me down.  That's the original.  Let's play the other one that has their.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  This is the original.  If I play this one, I got to get it right.  It's too late.  It's too late.  We're already taken down.  We're already taken down.  But worth watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Throughout a long year under pandemic conditions, the Ig Nobel Board of Governors kept a single-minded  focus on our goals.  I want.  Let's just put that dog like that.  Oh, he's carrying.  He's holding a big stick.  He's carrying a stick.  All the people and all the things needed to produce the 31st first annual Ig Nobel Prize  ceremony.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, this year.  It looks like that.  What year is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it really 2021?  The COVID-19 pandemic.  Anyway, I'll let you watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was still up on Vimeo.  They found it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They found it.  They finally got it back up on YouTube by re-recording the song.  But this is the problem with, of course, content ID.  I mean, there's no way that that's not a public domain song from 1914.  Absolutely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos says he was so influenced by his several minute trip to the top of the Earth's  atmosphere that he's going to give away a billion dollars to support conservation around  the Earth.  He says, nature is our life support system and it's fragile.  I was reminded of this just this past July when I went into space-ish with Space Adjacent  with Blue Origin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the other folks did last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not him.  Yeah, they went into space.  I heard, I'd heard that seeing the Earth from space changes one's point of view of the world.  I was not prepared for just how much that would be true.  That's pretty amazing since he only had like a couple of minutes up there.  But I'm not knocking it because a billion dollars.  Yeah, that's true.  He's ahead of me.  A billion dollars.  This is through the Bezos Earth Fund, which he started in 2020 to execute his $10 billion  commitment to fight climate change.  So actually, I like this statement.  The natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago when we enjoyed unspoiled  forests, clean rivers, and the pristine air of the pre-industrial age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, just what we need is a bunch of billionaires trying to optimize nature.  Screw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what we didn't have then?  We didn't have overnight delivery of something that we went online and ordered something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We didn't have a fleet of jets flying back and forth from Memphis, Tennessee to bring  me my kitty litter.  We didn't have climate change either.  Well, yeah.  Amazon is going to have a big, I guess we've got to do this too, Jason, hardware event  for September 28th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I'm going to be there.  Well, I'm going to be watching.  Normally, I would be there.  Well, do they stream it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they did not stream it last year.  They just invited the press and then everybody got to talk about it later.  That's a curious decision.  But you got to go.  I will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to go.  Yeah.  So when it's physical, I've been to all of their events.  And when it's not physical, I've been to all of their virtual events.  But I can come back on Wednesday and tell you everything I need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  We'll know all about it the next day.  The event is invite only, says The Verge.  So don't expect a public live stream.  But The Verge will be covering all the news as soon as it happens September 28th, 12 p.m.  Eastern, 9 a.m. Pacific.  Hey, good news, Ant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't have to move any shows.  Yay.  We'll just talk about it the next day on Twitter.  Oh, hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious to know why Amazon chooses to do that, though.  When literally all of their competitors are doing the live stream, why do they choose  not to?  Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're relatively new to the device launch game.  They've only done four of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they like to announce like dozens of devices, don't they?  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Like every year, I'm going to tell you, y'all are lucky because when you sit down, the first  year there were like 78 pieces of news.  The second year was like 131 pieces of news.  Maybe that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is really a lot.  I'm just going to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last year, they announced a bunch of actually was this year, I think earlier this year in  the spring, day what they call day one editions.  You remember that, Stacey?  Things that they were thinking about making.  And if enough people bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was their Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I put down some money on something.  In fact, I think I ordered the only thing that got approved, which is the Smart Sticky  Note printer, which is a printer that you pair to your Echo device.  And then you can say, Echo, print my grocery list or something like that, or print my to  do's.  And then it'll print it out for, oh, look, you could print a Sudoku.  I now love it.  Perfect.  It's a Sudoku printer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but I ordered it.  The goal was met on day three of 30.  Still, it says supposed to ship between July and September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, chip shortage, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe chip shortage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the Wi-Fi chips have been in short supply.  Can I just tell you today, Amazon said, hold on, I'm pretty sure this is under not  under embargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, have you been talking to Bezos?  Maybe Amazon didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I've got to check.  I was like, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet you plug it in for Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is not under embargo.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, today, Amazon announced in limited edition, $229.99 Echo Studio featuring Billie

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eilish's cover art for Happier Than Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, who cares?  Who the hell wants that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to see it?  Here's what it looks like.  You can have an emo teenager smoothing away on your Echo device.  I guess if you're really a big fan of Billie Eilish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just seems so niche.  And I guess it's just a cover print job.  I don't understand.  I'm curious about the economics of this and why Amazon's doing something like this on  hardware.  Because like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they have like a children's Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember they had.  They have a children's Echo and they actually did a line of Echo like smaller $99 speakers  that were like the Diane Von Fostberg and two other designers that you could buy with  their imagery on their Echoes.  It's a little expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is $230 the normal price for an Echo Studio?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's.  They're usually $250, aren't they?  This is $30 more, says the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just for Billie Eilish.  You know, I would buy it for the kitch factor, frankly.  People I know would come and say, why do you have some woman's face on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows, maybe maybe Shutterfly will start to allow us to print out our own photos on  an Echo show or Echo Studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's clearly for the massive Billie Eilish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are a lot of Billie Eilish fans out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are.  Definitely they are.  Oh, wait a minute.  The Echo Studio is $200.  This is $230.  So yeah, you're right.  $30 more.  $30 more.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also comes with what?  Four months of Amazon music, which does not seem like a smoking deal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should come with lots of Billie Eilish music.  No, six.  You get six months to Amazon Music Unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can listen to happier than ever in spatial audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the only thing you can listen to on this device is that album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  Because you're a big enough fan to have Billie Eilish on your device itself.  So they figure that's probably what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what it's, here's what it would look like on your Billie Eilish desk with your Billie  Eilish poster and your Billie Eilish wallpaper.  This is really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a puzzling device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where I brought it up because I'm like, how expensive is it to make?  What is the conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If even Alexa could be Billie Eilish's voice, that would be cool.  But no, they haven't done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that makes sense though because that's a digital product, but this is a physical  product.  It's going to sit there forever.  I just, I thought it was, I was flummoxed.  Flummoxed, I tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flummoxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably don't want Alexa whispering to you is the thing.  So you probably don't want Billie Eilish's voice.  She talks like this.  She does lots of whispering, whispering.  She's ASMR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am a fan of Aukey, A-U-K-E-Y battery products.  I won't be buying them on Amazon anymore.  They and 599 other Chinese brands have been kicked, kicked from Amazon for review fraud.  Amazon says we're not targeting China, which the state owned Chinese Central Television  said they might be.  But you can't do things like send emails out saying, we'll give you $10 off if you give  us a positive review because that, you know, games the review system.  Amazon says customers rely on the accuracy and authenticity of product reviews.  So we suspend, ban and take legal action against those who violate these policies wherever  they are in the world.  Aukey, M-Pow and Shenzhen, Youkeshu Technology Company.  They say also that $20 million of their funds have been frozen by Amazon for stuff already  sold.  I'm sure you can still buy those devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon makes money even when they kick vendors off their platforms.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's incredible.  Let's see.  What else is, I guess I should do a changelog.  Should I do a changelog?  Let's play the drums.  Oh, Burke is filling in.  So he's going to have to find the button, find where John stored the drummers.  Where did they put them?  There they are.  There we go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason, I should make you do this changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny that you say that because I actually wondered if you were going  to today because I know how much you love the changelog.  Well at this point, I don't even do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I let you put it all together.  So I very rarely see anything worth talking about.  Well like this, YouTube gets official video downloads on the web, saving you from using  very sketchy sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah.  Have you ever used a site to like rip a YouTube?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I use YouTube DL, but YouTube hates that because content creators sometimes count on  YouTube not allowing you to download stuff you watch there.  Maybe the thinking is if you did that, you might edit it out, edit out the video, the  ads and distribute it yourself or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or ask Ant Prud how do you remove a watermark from this video that I just downloaded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  That is a common comment that I get for one of my videos.  I have a video that talks about removing objects.  It's a tutorial on Premiere where you can remove certain objects in the video just using  mask and every single comment on there is asking me, well, can this work for watermarks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dang.  I thought you could download videos on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that?  No, I don't believe that that's like a baked in feature.  Well actually I'm pretty certain it's not a baked in feature unless you happen to have  a grown extension running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh see, I guess I must be.  So how would I, I'm looking, because I have YouTube premium.  By the way, this is only for YouTube.  Premium subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And only in India or France.  So this is a very limited trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is why he hates the change law, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only in India and France.  Downloaded videos can be played back by YouTube.  If you go to youtube.com slash feed slash downloads, see then I would, I don't have any downloads,  but if I did, they would be right here.  Yeah.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So who knows, maybe coming soon to a YouTube near you, you'll get a download button that  isn't the result of an extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody hated this idea, but Google's going to do it anyway.  Idle Detection, an API built into Chrome 94 for desktop and Android that detects user  inactivity.  Both Mozilla and Apple complained, but it's in there.  I get, why are they complaining?  Why don't they, the features designed for multi-user applications like meetings, chat  and online games.  The reason maybe because in schools, a lot of times when you're doing a zoom class or  something like that, they want to make sure that you're actually there and not, not pretending  to be there for attendance purposes.  So this feature notifies when a user is idle, it looks at things like the mouse, the keyboard,  screen locking or user switching away from the screen.  Applications which facilitate collaboration require more global signals about whether  the user is idle than are provided by the existing mechanisms that only consider a user's  application with the applications interaction with the applications on tag.  So developers from Slack and Google Chat liked it.  Mozilla's Tantech Chelek said, I consider Idle Detection too tempting of an opportunity  for surveillance capitalism motivated websites to invade an aspect of the user's physical  privacy, keep long-term records of physical user behaviors, discerning daily rhythms like,  oh, it's his lunchtime.  The computer sits idle for an hour or, and then using that for proactive psychological  manipulation.  Don't you think a burger from Burger King had been right, nice right about now?  In addition, such coarse patterns could be used by websites to surreptitiously max out  local compute resources for proof of work computations, i.e. Bitcoin, wasting electricity.  Crypto mining during lunch.  Yeah, yeah.  So despite the complaints, Chrome 94 has the Idle Detection API.  So there's something for everybody.  Google Maps can now adjust its Android Auto UI for right-hand drive cars.  So I guess the UI users.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that for like the people who drive on the left?  Yeah, like in the UK.  We're all like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you ever want to do that?  So the normally the navigation bar and the turn information cards are on the right side.  Because I guess if you're driving on the left side of the car, that's you're using your  right hand or I don't know.  But that but they can also adjust to the left side.  See how full of good stuff the changelog is.  You'd hate to miss that.  Google search filters introduced on the web last year are now coming to Android.  Explain to me, Jason, what is the Google search filter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think I read these, Leo?  OK, just kind of kind of pop through and find a headline and I go, oh, that's a change.  Significant. It's a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gmail search filters on Android work independently or post search.  The former means they appear after tapping the top now pill shaped field before entering  a query. As such, you can look for emails from a particular center recipient as well  as by date and attachment status without a particular term in mind.  This is rolling out for Gmail for Android.  If you understood that, you're probably happy.  Somebody's happy.  You're happy. Google's IOS.  That in there.  Oh, I don't care.  Oh, if you didn't, what would I make fun of?  Google's IOS 15 app updates bring Excel, YouTube, music and photos, widgets, focus mode  support. So, you know, it's funny because Google after IOS 14 came out, you may remember  because they didn't like the privacy stuff, declined to update any of their apps for  months and months and months.  But I guess they're kind of they said, well, I guess we're going to have to live with it  because they updated their apps for IOS 15 pretty much the day it came out.  You get widgets for photos, which is great.  There's also widgets for YouTube music, extra large widgets, four by two grid of.  So here, I'll show you.  This is big. So you get what's playing right now.  And then this four by two grid of tracks.  These are huge widgets.  Oh, wow. Yeah.  Big old widgets. Another feature that is really nice, by the way, and I hope Android does  something similar in the IOS 15 is this focus mode, which it's kind of like do not disturb  on steroids. It will like I have it right now.  Focus mode. I'm at work.  So it knows when I get to work and then sets the do not disturb, as I've previously  indicated automatically.  That's really cool. You can do it for going to sleep and all sorts of things.  Google's going to pay attention and give you and it will affect task reminders, Google  Maps navigation, home doorbell notifications, Gmail notifications and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has a focus mode.  They do that already.  Yeah. Part of the whole digital well-being tool set.  Yeah. Cool. Yeah.  Does something very similar. It's very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, in that case, it's about time, Apple.  Exactly.  Google Meet for Web gets automatic brightness boost when you're underexposed.  Aunt Pruitt likes it.  Now, if they could just get white balance.  Get that dad gum white balance.  That's kind of cool.  It'll say, oh, you're not very bright.  Let's see if we can turn up the volume.  Having too much light behind you, such as a window on a sunny day, can be challenging  for cameras. Google Meet on the Web now automatically detects when a user appears underexposed  and enhance enhances the brightness.  Here's it. Here's the. Yeah, it's good.  Here it is in action.  You can see there's some people here a little dark and Google's just brighten them up,  brightening them up. That's cool.  Yeah, it looks great. Yeah.  That's a nice idea.  You can control adjust video lighting from more settings and video.  So you can turn it out. It'll be rolling out today.  Fully available in the coming weeks for Google Workspace customers.  Oh, you got to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Things cost money.  Otherwise, they cost your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They cost your beta.  Data data. Oh, yeah.  Your privacy. Either you're the product or you're the customer.  That's right.  And you like this, Stacey.  Fitbit starts rolling out snore and noise detect for the Fitbit.  What? And Versa 5.  Apple does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if they're using the same algorithms they built for the Nest Hub too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because, well, because that's right.  The Nest Hub does it.  You were talking about that. That's right.  This is actually very important because it could be a sign of sleep apnea.  It could be a sign of other issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also looks or it's a sign that you don't snore that badly.  And your husband is just exaggerating.  Really sensitive.  That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We played my stores on this show and everybody made me feel much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nothing.  I know Lisa did that to me the other day.  She recorded my snoring.  How wooed.  I'm not going to plug it in for her, that's for sure.  And that's the Google change law.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  US government says no, no, no to Zoom.  They had a $15 billion deal for Five9, which is another video conferencing company.  The US government says no because we...  China.  Zoom's China ties could make its acquisition of the software company a national security risk.  Five9 is based in San Jose, California, I think.  Is that right?  The Five9 acquisition is subject to certain telecom regulatory approvals, said Zoom.  We have made filings with the various applicable regulatory agencies  and these approval processes are proceeding as expected.  Five9 declined to comment.  Paying attention to the Chinese connection with Zoom.  Zoom is actually...  I don't know if Zoom has Chinese ties.  The software is written in China, but the company is owned by Americans.  Did we mention Cameo calls last week?  We were talking about Cameo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't believe that we mentioned the Calls feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New feature, you can have a celebrity call you for up to 15 minutes one on one.  The celebrity sets the duration, time and price of the call averages right now around $31.  Well, let's go see who we can talk to on Zoom.  Here is Hagbert.  What's the guy in Harry Potter?  Hagbert?  Hagrid.  Hagrid.  The guy who plays Hagrid.  You can talk to him.  He's available right now.  He's just sitting there waiting for your call.  15 minutes for two...  $15 for two minutes.  Hagrid's waiting.  Hello, Harry Potter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $15 is not very much to be able to put guest Colin Hagrid from Harry Potter in our show notes.  Should I just call him and say, how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's up, Greg?  How you doing?  No.  Who else can I talk to?  Austin Nichols, Nikki Blonsky.  She was in Hairspray.  Is this the lowest rung of celebrity hell at this point?  Yeah, I'll take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to ask when you get on there.  No, no, no.  I deserve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If someone can make several thousand dollars a month just to do two minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that makes it nice is you can also give some to charity.  I think a lot of celebrities do that.  Well, look, you could talk to not Tom Cruise tomorrow at 3 o'clock.  $25 for two minutes.  Maybe you'll do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Tom Cruise.  What if people wanted to call me to ask me personally their questions and have me actually  answer them and ask them questions back?  15 bucks.  How much would I charge for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much should you charge for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we should...  How much would you pay?  We should call some of these people.  We should just make this a feature on the show.  And now it's time for the cameo.  They probably charge more if you're using it in a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say they probably have something in their terms of service like...  You may not use this.  Can't broadcast, can't record.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just for you, I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Labiard.  You could call him and ask how you pronounce his name.  I was trying to see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to find the September guy in there but he's not...  Uh-uh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  It's not...  Ooh, T-Bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, Melissa Etheridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Melissa Etheridge.  You could talk to her for three minutes for no money.  Wait a minute.  How can that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This must be like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unlocked access premium.  She'll be taking cameo calls, zero dollars for three minutes.  Apparently, she's just doing it for the goodness of her heart.  And there's two tickets remaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe cameo paid her to do it.  Like, would you please do this?  And to get people to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To get people to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  We're on to you, cameo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, just thought I'd pass that along if you want to talk to Hagbert.  Whatever the hell is me.  Hagrid.  Hangar, hangar, hangar.  Hagrid, Hagrid, Hagrid.  Hello, Harry Potter, I'm Hangry.  Hangry Hagrid.  I will talk to you for two minutes exactly for $15.  All right, let's...  I think it's time to wrap this puppy up because, well, it's almost waffle time.  So we are going to get to the picks of the week next.  We, as always, start our picks of the week with...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A random person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A random person.  No, we always start with Stacey.  I'll do.  We always start with Stacey.  Stacey Higginbotham.  Your random pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, this...  It is random.  I'm looking around.  I'm looking at my desk.  What do I have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  You don't have to do one.  It's not required.  It's not.  Don't look around.  I don't know why I blink today.  I know that feeling where you're just going, quick, what do I have?  What do I have?  I have a Melissa Etheridge Amazon Echo show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do the Billie Eilish thing.  Can I retroactively do Billie Eilish?  Yeah, go back in time.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to go get it.  Because I got it right here.  Hold on a second.  The Billie Eilish one?  Excuse me, Stacey, pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's he going to come back with?  This is already going really well.  I have in my hands...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I could have gone around the back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where's my hand?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is...  I'll do this for Stacey.  This is Stacey's pick of the week.  It is my Henri the Chihuahua Amazon Echo.  Wow.  How about that?  Courtesy of Mr. Micah Sargent.  Only $50 extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did that come from?  What is that?  I'm so confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That looks like a Micah Sargent-ism.  I think Micah must have made this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is just how easy it would be to make a Billie Eilish Echo show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, shut or fly, like they're missing opportunities.  I think it's just a little sleeve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just printed a little sleeve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could you do it for your Nest audios?  Because I want to do that because they could be prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Henri Echo.  Henri Echo.  That's Stacey's pick of the week, ladies and gentlemen.  Excellent.  Very nice.  Very, very nice.  I have failed, y'all.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next week I'll be back with something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never have a pick, so it's okay.  I couldn't complain.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jason Hale, are you going to do anything?  You want to do something?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I kind of had that moment earlier today too where I was like, what am I going to bring  on?  What do I do?  But then I realized yesterday we had an event.  I think it was during Security Now that there was a fire event in the area.  It was actually pretty close to the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to stop the show and say, we just want to save what we've done so far in case we  suddenly have to leave.  We got an evacuation warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of crazy.  That's a little too close to home, not going to lie.  But I've been using an app lately.  Honestly, actually now that I say this, I don't know if it's only Northern California  or only California itself, but basically I've been using an app that shows fire events.  When something comes up, and it's called, by the way, WatchDuty, but when a fire event  is reported, I found that this app updates super quick and I get a notification right  away.  So when the fire event happened, I was notified on my phone very, very soon after it happened.  It was the Ormsby fire.  I think that was it.  Yes.  Yep.  And yeah, so I got a notification as it went along.  You can subscribe via text message, and I'm sure we all do, at least here in this area,  to the Nixle updates.  This is kind of similar, but it's embedded into the app and you can kind of go around  the map and find other fire events in the area.  It can be a little slow to update, but eventually you can find, yeah, it's really slow to update.  I'm not really seeing some of the other ones right now.  At least it's showing the one from yesterday.  But it gives you a little bit of the information.  It tells you kind of where it's at right now as far as progress is concerned.  Is it contained?  Is it not?  The percentage, that sort of stuff right now.  Boy, I wish we had this yesterday.  That's great.  Yeah.  And I found it to be pretty reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it only fires or is it all natural disasters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, no, this is just fires.  And I'm actually thinking now, if I go into settings here for notifications, okay, so  It is limited to this area.  So it's probably not very useful to most anybody listening or watching.  But if you're in the Bay Area, you want an app like this because holy cow, these fires,  they suck.  And they move fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is why they evacuated, I think, 900 homes yesterday in our area because you don't,  you know, they move fast and you don't have time to get out.  So that's good.  I like watching.  Scary stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a number of apps that I found on the Play Store that track fires.  And I'm sure there are apps that track other natural disasters and everything too.  It's just, we happen to live in fire country apparently now.  And I've tried some of the other ones and they're really slow and kind of choppy and  everything.  This is kind of the best one that I've found so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DeClair, who lives in our area and is a viewer, was filling me in on the arms of fire yesterday  because DeClair in the IRC chat room was watching Watch Duty and knew what was going on.  So proof of concept yesterday.  Yay.  Thank you, DeClair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully that's helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or is it DC Lair?  I don't know.  DeClair?  DeClair, I get it.  I declare it's time for Ant Pruitt's Pick of the Weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I swear you and that Southern Georgia accent kills me every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I declare, sir, it is time, my friend, for your Pick of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just added this first one here, Future Moments, because Mr. Howell is on.  You've ever heard of Future Moments?  Nope.  Mr. Howell?  Future Moments?  Mm-hmm.  I don't believe so.  They do a lot of mobile apps for content creators to do music and videos and things of that  nature.  But just recently they've been able to port their iOS apps over to Mac OS.  I saw a press release for that like a day or so ago.  Made me think about you because you and your music production stuff.  Maybe it's something of interest for you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at this mic swap, which models well-known microphones.  Ah, I think that's kind of...  So you could have an old-timey radio mic, a Shure SM58, an SM7B, a Sony Lavalier.  I'm going to have to play with this to see how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, this is the nerdiest thing I've ever seen.  It's so nerdy, but I love the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great.  You can have Studio G Room A or Studio G Room B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it and I was like, man, I always see these cool things for the iOS side of things.  I never see it on the Android side.  So now on Android, but mic swap is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to steal this one, boy.  Let me go look at the Android, see what they got here.  Audio Fix, Video Master, Hear Boost, and Video Verb.  Let's see what these do.  Audio Fix.  Video Verb.  I believe that adds reverb.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, reverb to the sound of your video.  Boost improves the audio in your video.  Video Reverb.  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Android doesn't have the mic swap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Nope.  No.  Everybody just sort of went, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well this one looks like you can import a video, just the volume is a six-pan equalizer.  This is nice.  This is Video Master.  So it's all audio, it sounds like.  Hear Boost, which enhances...  So it's swapping what?  The mic on the phone?  Can I swap the mic on the phone for a Telefunken U47?  Yeah.  If you could swipe the mic on your phone for a $2,000 microphone, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it'll sound just like the real thing.  Just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh-huh.  We'll see.  I'm going to download it because that's a cool idea.  I like the idea.  Check it out.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I doubt it.  I'm not on Mac OS, so I don't know.  But, you know.  So, I just thought I'd share this.  I thought of Mr. Jason when I saw that.  Thank you.  Love it.  But my other pick, I actually had it here.  I've been playing with these Marshall monitors, the Marshall Monitors 2 with the active noise  cancellation.  I tend to get a little bit leery about headphones because it's like everybody says they sound  good and most of the time they don't.  The price of these were a little bit pricey when I first looked at it.  And then I tried them out and I said, okay, they actually do sound pretty good, even if  they're Bluetooth and wireless like this, or I can plug them into my computer and monitor  that way.  I listened to them with checking out some Hans Zimmer because that's like my standard  is to see how things sound with all of the different frequencies from 20 hertz up to  20 kilohertz.  Make sure everything's coming through.  It's got a flat profile, allegedly.  So you're going to hear a little bit more in mid and the lows when you're enjoying your  music.  So that might throw some people off because a lot of people, they either want it super  duper bass heavy or they want it a little bit more in the upper tier, the higher frequencies.  But yeah, I tried those out and I let the hardheads try them out and if they like them,  they must sound pretty good.  Those are the Marshall Monitor 2 with active noise cancellation.  You see that little yellow thing on the...  What is that volume?  That's just a control knob.  I think that's a little finicky.  I think they could design that a little bit better, but from an audio quality standpoint,  yeah, they do pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of like the retro look.  They're kind of cool looking.  Yeah.  Marshall, is that the Marshall amp, folks?  It must be.  Yes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same thing.  Yeah.  It's the same font.  So they're following the style of their amps with the gold and the black.  I like how it collapses.  That's really nice.  Sometimes it's headphones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was quite nice.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that is expensive, but dang.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's actually not expensive for good headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  And I'm about to kill these headphones.  So...  But that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People pay for Beats for the same amount of money.  Same price.  They're not very good.  I don't pay for Beats.  No, they're not very good.  They don't sound that good.  But these do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will check them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds great.  And they're hard hit approved, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hard hit approved.  Finally a plug for your Instagram.  What are you posting these days on the Insta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just little random stuff here and there.  Still shooting some stuff at the football games.  I loved this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw this.  I really like this picture.  Yeah.  Are you sure the white balance isn't off?  It's definitely off, but it's okay.  I see that red popping, man.  That's color grading.  Oh, it's grading.  That's cute.  That's definitely shaded to the blue.  But I'm not going to say anything.  I'm not going to because that would be wrong.  That's all right.  Give it to me.  I can take it.  No, these are beautiful shots.  I love your moon, by the way.  I don't know how you got that.  Yeah, that is a very hard shot.  That is a tough shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was actually a time lapse and it took a long time and a lot of trial and error putting  that together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a full moon last night, right?  This was a couple of nights ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually shot that a little while back and just been sort of tweaking it because,  like you said, it's pretty difficult and then you have all the noise reduction to deal with.  Yeah, so hard.  It's not easy.  On the Insta?  Follow me on Instagram, at underscorepruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Stacey failed us so badly with her pics of the week, I have two courtesy of the  chat room.  How about that?  Baratunde Thurston, a good friend of the network, would love Baratunde.  I had his book, How to Be Black.  We interviewed him when it came out on Triangulation.  Apparently he just got green lit for an animated version by ABC.  It's in development right now.  Oh, right.  This is great.  He's going to write and executive producer alongside Courtney Lilly, who is the producer  and writer known for Arrested Development and The Cleveland Show.  Pretty good deal.  Lawrence Fishburne will executive produce even better.  Same people, Cinema Gypsy Productions, that did Blackish, Grownish, and Mixedish.  I hope they don't call it How to Be Blackish, but I'm sure they wouldn't.  So I think that's really good news for a very good friend and a very talented guy.  That's awesome.  We'll be watching for that.  And here's something for you, Stacey, that I thought you might be interested in.  Again, this is from the chat room.  Thank you ScooterX for the Baratunde pic and thank you, I forgot who it was, for this.  Hey, read with Reese's Book Club.  I think you'd like to do this with your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, y'all are trolling me on the show, not just in the chat now, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reese Witherspoon.  I didn't know she grew up in Venezuela.  She said, because I was in Venezuela, I had an insatiable appetite for reading from fictional  novels to computer science manuals.  What?  So this is something she did with her young kids.  She's partnered with Google to offer a hands-free immersive reading experience on Nest smart  speakers, smart display and assistant-enabled mobile devices in English-speaking countries  around the world.  You can discover Reese Witherspoon's monthly book picks, take a quiz for personalized book  recommendations and get exclusive commentary about each book from Reese herself.  I guess she doesn't read the book, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that would be...  You know what?  Here's a skill that I would actually value.  with unreliable narrators, but you can't put that on the book cover because that would  destroy the people who like it, right?  But I hate them.  So if I could just ask Google, hey, does this book have an unreliable narrator?  Google could tell me yes or no.  What's an unreliable narrator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean to me?  Bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the worst day is ex machina ever.  It's like, oh my God, I was drunk the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just poorly written.  Like I woke up and it was all a dream, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the trope has been like, you know, the person who's telling...  The narrator's been like, oh, I was mentally ill the whole time, so you can't trust anything  I said, is basically the idea.  So it's not just it's a dream.  It's like I was drunk.  I was mentally disturbed.  Freaking hate them.  Like the girl on the train is the first one.  That's a perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it ruined the book for me.  I agree with you 100%.  And then all of a sudden you realize, well, nothing I've been reading could...  Maybe it could all be untrue.  Very frustrating.  I'm with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate them.  They're a big trend.  And I like reading airport style thrillers.  But that's the thing.  It's a trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to keep doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a trend since the 16th century.  Okay, well yeah.  It's not something brand new.  Let's put it that way.  I'm going to pick it up on Wikipedia and let's see what they say here.  The term was coined...  Okay, it's not that old.  Not that new.  Old.  It was coined in 1961.  But I think unreliable narrators have been around for a while.  Like Baron Munchausen's tale of being swallowed by a whale.  That's a good example.  And that goes way back.  Maul Flanders also another 19th century novel.  So it's...  Huck Finn wasn't all that reliable, apparently.  Holden Caulfield.  Well, he wasn't unreliable.  He was just innocent.

Transcript:  You can do it well.  But a lot of these...  And a lot of these are thrillers.  Like I really hate it in a thriller setting.  It's fine if you're making some sort of philosophical point about, you know, existential crisis.  No, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Girl on a Train is a perfect example where it's something modern and new that they do  could throw you a curve.  It's like, oh yeah, you ought to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't start that channel.  So many things to talk about.  Let me think.  Who might have started the Beer, Wine and Cocktail Channel on Club Twitter?  I wonder who did that?  Welcome to our new community moderator.  Manny the Clown says, is kombucha allowed?  Yes, it's allowed.  That's just one of many reasons you might want to join Club Twitter.  It's not just talk about Twitch shows, although we do have a chat room going in Club Twitter  for every Twitch show.  Discord is such a great place to hang out.  And I think we've all made new friends.  I know I have in our Club Twitch Discord members only.  Oh, did you add food, cooking, barbecue and grilling?  No comment.  So I was the one who did Linux, ham radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I put ham radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you did.  Oh, good.  Nice.  You have a few geeky ones in there.  That's nice.  It's really fun.  So it's a great community, great place to hang.  There's other benefits besides the kind of warm fuzzy feeling knowing that you're supporting  Twitch.  You're keeping our shows going, keeping our hosts employed.  Club Twitter also gives you ad free versions of every show we do, audio and video.  You get access to the Discord server and the Twitch plus feed, which is content that doesn't  make it into other shows.  Things like our untitled Linux show and the GizFizz and Lisa and I are going to do an  ask me anything.  Is it this week or next week?  No, sir.  No, sir.  You got a little while.  You're going to do a let's play this week, do trivia or something, right?

It'll cost a little bit less.  So if that's your jam.  The nice thing about Club Twitch, it's month to month.  So seven bucks.  If you don't like it, cancel it any time and you're done.  But I think it's a great place to go.  And I think it's a great way to support what we're doing.  Go to twit.tv slash club twit.  Somebody was I had mentioned that the cruise that Lisa and I were going to go on to Asia  in January was canceled.  And Chris in Miami said, what you've canceled the twit cruise?  No, we have not.
