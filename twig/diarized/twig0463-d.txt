Transcript:  He is a contributor to tech Republic and we're thrilled you could join us on short notice. I appreciate it. Thank you  My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Oh, we always love having an on anyway. It's always great to have you on so  Breaking news  So breaking news just came out half an hour ago  Samsung and Apple have buried the hatchet  In their what is it nine years now?  long running court case in  Which went back and forth Apple sued Samsung on patent infringement Samsung counters sued seven years  I guess it's been going on since 2011  Initially resulting in a 1 billion dollar ruling for Apple  Then the Supreme Court heard it and  Then sent it back to the lower court  approving the decision but saying now we got to figure out how much money you own the  Last we heard five hundred thirty nine million dollar fine to Samsung and on Apple's behalf  But the judge Lucy Coe said I want you guys to go and talk. I don't want this to go to trial. I  Don't I don't want this to go to trial so that the companies have  Buried the hatchet no comment. Do you think the settlement was? Yeah, it's not clear  What is clear is that?  This was something that Steve Jobs kind of launched and he wanted to go global thermonuclear war on Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That you said nuclear I remember those exact free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the company waged this war even though it wasn't even with a victory for Apple  It's a lot of stuff was revealed about Apple's process. You know there was definite definitely collateral damage on both sides  I'm sure Apple  Got some money  But I think really the what really happened is that both sides had leadership changes and lost their stomach for interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, on well until they should have it was a waste of time and money  I think I don't know about you  But I mean the fact that they spent months and who knows how many millions arguing about whether Apple invented rounded corners like  Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I think Apple probably felt vindicated because the jury agreed that Apple's patents were good. They were they upheld the patents  There was some debate I think over  You know  Did Samsung copy Apple the jury decided that it kind of had kind of not totally but kind of had  Samsung no longer really copies iPhones. That's pretty clear. This is about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They sort of dropped that about three versions ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What didn't me although the irony is now pretty much everybody's copying Apple's notch  Which I think many agree is its least desirable feature of the iPhone seems weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like some phones have notches they don't even need them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was what I wanted to point out is just how important is the notch because they have sensors in them  and if people are going to wine and claim that they have to have a  Zero bezel phone you you got to put those sensors somewhere or do what Oppo did with the Find X

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is a very strange design. It's a phone that has a motor in it that raises the camera  So we don't have to have a notch and then it slides back down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because moving parts are always awesome. Yeah, that's that sounds like something that should go bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, we'll see I mean it's a beautiful phone and because it has no notch  It has a ninety three point eight percent screen to body ratio, which is as high as you can get pretty much  It's just the smallest little bezel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely pretty slick looking I give them that you know, but personally I'm not into this whole  bezel lists movement or what have you because I  Swipe from side to side, you know on my Android device going to different screens and it's so much easier  With somebody to have you know meat hooks like mine  To have a little bezel to give me some type of you know a breathing room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the idea is to give you a bigger everybody wants bigger screens, right nobody wants  bigger phones  So the idea is to how big can we get the screen without?  Making the phone any bigger and when you that is a six point four two inch phone the Oppo Find X  Because it has no bezels. I don't know. Do you have you tried the Samsung?  S8 and s9 the with the very little bezel on the side that they kind of curve around  Do you not like this did and I didn't enjoy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just seems like I fat fingered on the screen a lot when you have these really really thin bezels  I even struggle with the pixel to well I had to excel but I still struggle with just going from  Screen to screen, you know with their horizontal swipe, you know, yeah, I agree. I'm the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like the lack of in fact, I didn't like the edge  Samsung  Edges for the same reason I just found that I was triggering things all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew do you use an Android or are you an iPhone guy? I'm Android and and are you and your Android as well? Yeah  Yes, sir  So I'm the only one here with an iPhone 10. I use them all I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I get why you use them all it makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting, yeah, but but I carry to my daily two or three maybe four  Five top no more than I just don't have enough pockets, you know, yeah  It's two hands and five. I would say today though. The dominant phone is the iPhone  You know, we had on Friday interviewed Phil Zimmerman the creator of PGP  Who and he started to remember a silent circle and created the black phone  Which was a privacy focused phone which failed  He said it failed not because the technology was bad  But because we didn't understand that in the cell phone market if you don't have a carrier you don't have anything  Nobody's gonna buy a phone. We just couldn't sell enough of them to justify the manufacturer of them  He carries now an iPhone and he says from point of view of security and privacy  There just really isn't anything but the iPhone to be considered. That's your primary concern

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's fair. If you care a lot about that, then they are better for that  The only the only reasons I've like anecdotally friends and family they want iMessage  Right Rose gold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their lock-ins right there those two right there they're like  It shows you have a trivial really how trivial the advantage is for I know we go on about the cameras and the process

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're in the OLED screens or whatever and really what all my daughter cares about is can I iMessage people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung today sent out invitations to the Samsung Galaxy s9 launch  Which will be appropriately August 9th, so we're only a little more than a month away  from the launch of  The note 9 in fact the FCC already has the note 9  Everything I've seen it looks very much like the note 8 which I thought was a great phone  I really don't like the note 8  The 9 is a pretty slick device great hardware. Yeah, and it'll probably have an updated Qualcomm 845 in it  and the Exynos of course  I hope it continues to have a headphone jack. It's one of the last flagships to have a headphone jack  I still miss mine. I know that's a really big thing to give up  That I don't mind the notch I can live with the notch the head bring the headphone jack back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know after a while you sort of train yourself to to look around that notch if you will it's about like  Glasses after a while you don't see the scratches on your lenses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the notch does have function, I mean it's not a cosmetic thing you need to put the cameras somewhere, right?  What's interesting is the new iOS 12 which the public beta just came out this week on Tuesday and yesterday  I guess or Monday and  On on the iPad they've moved on iOS 12. They used to have the date in this time in the center  They've moved it to the edges to make room for I'm guessing a notch will be on the next iPad  So the notch is here to stay  Yeah, I can live with that  But I'm sorry about the headphone jack. I think that unfortunately that's gone forever as well  and maybe Samsung will take a you know a clue and  continue with a fingerprint reader in the in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Headphone jack I'd be okay with losing the headphone jack if you could get better headphones like wireless  You know a lot of them are just garbage. They just drop out we don't you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot there's latency in Bluetooth as well. Although I have to say Apple's air pods are less latent than normal Bluetooth headphones  So they're doing something to speed those up, but there's still a seat which means you're there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wear a lot of in-ear headphones. They're just hanging out of your ear like that. Yeah, they followed or they hurt too, right? Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Struggle with just the protocol to Bluetooth protocol because  If I want to try out some Bluetooth devices like just regular headphones to walk around the block or work out in there's always this  Interference they sound great the few that I've reviewed and tested they sound great  But the second I put them in my put my phone in my pocket or something  I start getting all of this static interference and I'm like man. This is just this is just ruining it  You know, so give me a wired headset and I can continue to have high fidelity audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know without all of the dropouts. I don't see why if the phone is literally in your pocket  It can't make a decent connection from your pocket. Yes here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean this got nothing to do with the the speaker quality. That's just a protocol. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe yeah. All right. Maybe yeah  I agree if you get rid of wires and still be as reliable as wired that probably is the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite was wasn't the Google headphones where they tried the pixel buds  Yeah, and you had to in order to pair them you had to like put them back in the case and reset them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Such a bad design the rumor is that there will be with the new pixel 2 or 3  I guess it'll be there'll be a new pixel buds design as well. I hope so cuz that's like oh I got rid of mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't use them. Yeah, you want to use our headphones. How about we kick you in the face? Yeah a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the thing that they touted the trans simultaneous translation didn't work at all  It was terrible didn't even work  So those you know, they sounded all right, but then they had a wire  I don't know. Yeah, as long as we're talking cameras, I'll quickly run through some other rumors  This is Android police saying the next version of the LG which the V 30 very nice phone thin cube  Very nice from the V 40 will have five five  cameras and  to two on the front and  face unlock and  And three on the back I have a three lens a phone I just bought the Huawei p20 Pro and  It does very nice imagery, but I think I think it's a kind of gimmicky one on the p20 one is monochrome one is color  Okay, and they work together to give you a better image  The exo mark shouldn't they give you a better HDR, right? Yes, exactly and better low light, right?  And  In fact the XL mark gave him the highest camera phone rating  Well, I think 103 something like that they've ever given everyone's meals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember the onion about the razors with like three blades and four blades 80 blades

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, screw it. There is a phone  We were talking about yesterday a Mac break weekly with like what is it's 14 different sensors on it  If all that that's the stupidest looking thing too. It looks like something's wrong with it  Nice looks like it's a genetic  mule

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Laporte with that Huawei phone  How you how are you feeling about it from a performance standpoint?  Because it has that Kirin chip in there as its own chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean as far as I can tell it's a smooth and you know, it's there it is  What is the name of that phone? That is that weird?  It looks it looks awful it looks  It looks like an abomination

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Software where the AI puts eyes on everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like a glitch literally a  Creepy looking phone because they don't put everything in any logical array or order. It's just  This is like a glitch. Let's put some more cameras on there. So the p20 is nice. I would not recommend it  Okay, this is the Huawei Chinese phone  The camera is okay, but you know you the pixel 2 is great camera the iPhones got a great camera  Good great cameras kind of table stakes in the Android or iOS  Sphere right now almost all the flagship phones have very very good cameras p20. I may be marginally better  But there are some I'm saying some serious privacy concerns  Yeah, well but to add that to that  The first thing I wish I'd kind of screenshot I'll do I'll reset it and do it again  The very second question they ask you is before you get into Android setup  Huawei says would you like to have accurate weather forecasts? Oh, yeah  Well for that you need to give us permission to access your location. Okay, that makes sense  Your IMEI number and your mac address  And your mac address  Weather  Whoa, I mean I guess kudos to them for telling me they're spying on me. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not hiding it. No, they know us Americans are just gonna hit next next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and now well now I don't want to do I want to put anything do I put my last pass on there?  Do I want to put my my checking account on there? I mean, I'm it sounds like this phone. They've got it completely  Bugged

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a really expensive burner phone, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the screen is an lcd. It's a 1080p lcd. It's not very good. It's not a great panel  So, uh, it's not particularly cheap if you buy it in the us  It might be cheaper in china probably is but if you buy in the us, it's not particularly cheaper  I I would say get a if you want a really nice feature  I mean a very nice feature rich android device with a great camera  The s9 is a good choice the note 9 will probably be a good choice. I would stay away from the p20

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not get it. Yeah, that would that would make me nervous. It's that's scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That they want my imei they want so basically in the very very early setup  Under a completely bogus pretext they're they're saying well, can can we can we track you?  Yeah  Down to the device down to the device  That is hilarious and and having given that permission not to android but to  Huawei  Now you can be assured that everything you do is tied to your device id

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this has nothing to do with google. This is all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then if you happen to visit china  Well, yeah, they could target government services to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Well for your for your benefit. So that's the question actually. This is a larger philosophical question  So what if china knows everything about me what it what?  What could happen what could go wrong unless I go to china maybe but but if assuming that i'm not going to go to china  What do I care if the chinese government has a dossier on me is that something I I mean, you know  There's a obviously a it's it's insulting and  You know, they shouldn't but but what can they do to me really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's fair. They could  You're just as likely to be a target of hackers with or without the chinese government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not advocating for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But i'm saying definitely depends on the person if there's somebody that's working on the hill  Yeah, they they they got no member of no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But of course nobody cares in in washington  We know there's many many stingrays in washington many run by apparently foreign governments  Yeah, that the president refuses to use a secured phone  Uh, we know that pence's phone was hacked very early on  So, yeah if you're a government  And and that by the way is the I I can't remember if it's the department of commerce  It's the recommendation of the u.s. Government that you'd not buy phones from cte huawei or xiaomi  And and now I see why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny though people pay a lot of attention to the phone  but  like dozens of people I know lots of people I know have routers and and other devices in their house that are  Chinese made they've got everything's chinese made  Everything in your house, you know, it's got it can track all kinds of  Activity and no one thinks about that. It's just a box. So this is a this is a pixel 2 that's made in china

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an iphone 10 that's made in china on the other hand. It didn't ask for permission  right from  That's what but ultimately that's why I think phil zimmerin  Says trust apple because even though they're assembled in china apple's paying attention  To what's going on presumably in foxconn and they're not allowing stuff to be put on the phone and so forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I gotta say apple, you know, I think they get a lot of positive marks for their commitment to  Privacy and so on but did they not agree to give the chinese government effectively a backdoor?  to  To their devices and to their users in china. I don't know. Did they not do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they do do that. Yes in china. Yes, not to americans, but in china, yeah, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we get privacy, which is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And thank you to apple but hd editor in our chat room said actually something that's really a very good point  I think people don't consider the friend of a friend problem. Sure. I may not care  That the chinese government can spy on me through my huawei phone  But i'm also giving up information about friends and family. That's a good point  And that is a really good point that is a good point. So I will uh go home  They do allow you to uh unlock it. They have a website where you can unlock it and root it  And maybe i'll do that. Maybe i'll just say this is my burner phone for rooting purposes  But that's a really good point and something we don't we often don't consider i've talked about this before  When you say yeah, you can have my contacts. You're not only giving your information  You're giving everybody in your address's book information to this company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the kind of the the flu analogy where I where I use  That with people I say well, I don't want to get a flu shot  but doctors will say well you might not want a flu shot, but everybody you come into contact with  Is going to get the flu from you. So  It's kind of you know, it's not for you. It's for the people coming to contact with you

Field he wrote it for a tech crunch brian brachin  Saying he's chief executive officer of kairos which develops this stuff  He says law enforcement absolutely should not be using existing face recognition technology  because  of racial biases  He said as a black chief executive of a software company developing facial recognition services  I have a personal connection to technology both culturally and socially and he's  Seriously concerned that a lot of innocent people will go to jail  a lot of innocent people of color  Will go to jail because there's no place in america for face recognition that supports false arrests  and murder

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree 100 it's it's not there yet. It's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not there and it must concern you because you could be a victim

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know and I can just take this take this back several notches just to something fairly simple  You know right now you're looking at me on the screen and I have a beard. Okay?  and  If I was to shave my beard and just go with the whole vandyke look goatee look or what have you  I'm categorized a certain way because i'm a bald black man with beard and yeah, you'd look like  Nondistinguishable, you know, yeah and it bugs me because um  I've done i've done that a few times just to experiment and see what happens  uh with my social media and engage with certain people online or whatever and just  the communication that I get from people based off of  This look versus when i've shaven it off it's fascinating, you know people think i'm less intelligent for whatever reason  Oh my god, really?  I've been told oh, oh, you're just a meathead because i'm bald headed and I have a well and another another point of uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prejudice you have a southern accent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Southern accent, you know and and i'm thinking  This is the type of data that's being fed into all of these ai systems and it's just not right  You got to fix this stuff. So, you know, that's the point there about the whole gorilla stuff. Oh god that that you know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's an important point too. We keep on concentrating on the algorithm itself, but it's the incoming data that needs an audit  too, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's on medium. I'm trying to remember who wrote it, but it they basically the argument was  um  The facial recognition should not be used period  by government  Forces or law enforcement that it's basically the technology  And the implications of the technology are so enormous that it shouldn't be used period at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So though it depends on the use if you're going to use it to find a missing child  We're going to use it to find, you know, a missing Alzheimer's patient  um  But as soon as you start carving out well, well, but no, no you could  The technology is not bad. Its use is bad. You regulate not the technology but the use and I agree  It should not be used in law enforcement. It's not ready. It may never be ready  I'm arguing there, but that doesn't mean that the technology should then be cut off from other purposes that could save lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft and I have a problem with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, because that means uh, we know that  See, there's still though risks. We know that concert venues for instance use amazon's recognition  To identify bad actors people have had problems with in the past and refuse admission

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I presume casinos have been doing that for as long as they could right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, hard conquerors, but if but if this fate, but if recognition thinks all black people look the same  That's not that's not a good use of it. Yeah, it's a it's a lower  Harm, but still not a good use of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I mean the promise of facial recognition is we can recognize  You individually and yet the technology just cannot do that. Right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually  Bald guy with goatee on my left here  It looks exactly like  Microsoft does say that uh, it's been using uh, additional training  To improve results. They say their error rates  Are down 20 times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't this isn't this only a data problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Arguably

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which is which is to say what all which is a bigger issue here is what does society have photos of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  I think there is a larger problem. Actually, my daughter's doing her college thesis on this which is that unintentional biases  Introduced into all of these automated systems because the people who are creating the systems  Pass their biases and ignorance and inabilities on  And the problem is it's so unconscious. That's what kathy o'neill writes about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With weapons of math destruction and zainab tufekci too. I mean these the algorithms that drive  Social platforms that drive google that drive, you know, they're designed by human beings and human beings have biases  Unconscious biases largely in those getting coded in the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so we're newspapers and so we're movie studios and so we're tv studios and it's true across all of that  I'm not not justifying any of it. I'm just saying that's exactly the problem is that it's is that the process of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  civilization of improvement over time is that we that these biases we you could I mean you could trace  His the history of america  In some degree is as we we learn about these biases  We try to correct for them and a lot of it is really just mass mind and cultural consciousness  And it's a process of getting woke and then getting woke again and then getting woke again

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a process just like you said and we're making progress. I hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are sometimes two steps forward one step back used to us back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it feels to me like oftentimes algorithms in particular youtube's recommendation algorithm facebook's newsfeed algorithm are actually entrenching  people's biases  Instead of trying to help correct them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that that is something that has changed and I think it's probably what c was talking about is what we'll talk about on friday  On triangulation is that big data and fast computation?  Have kind of weaponized these  Biases in in new ways and they happen faster and more powerfully than they have in the past  And so maybe that's the two steps backward  Is uh that these biases are getting writ large and when police as a perfect example when?  When when law enforcement starts using biased face recognition software to arrest people  Uh, that is an example of how the bias can really I mean there's always been bias, right?  I mean  Witnesses eyewitnesses are notoriously biased and bad at picking out faces, but it's like it's a slower process

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right and you're not talking about bias in an algorithm that controls what two billion people are seeing  I mean, we've never seen anything on that scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, um  I'd say right and I take the point matthew, but I but I think we have to acknowledge that all of american society  At scale as bias. Yeah, it's just and and it's not just the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes billions of decisions a second. Yeah, that's kind of my point is that  That it's uh, yeah, we all have our we all have biases that get acted out  Yeah, well what if what I think every day but when a computer is doing it at mass scale  That can have a much right when law enforcement does it at mass scale too when every police officer in the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah is making decisions, uh every few minutes and i'm not knocking all police officers i'm just saying  That is their bias their decisions. Well, yeah, we have the data and and and we know that and that's at scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the issue. I think there's one thing that we're trying to fight. I think now is that people  Aren't accustomed to thinking of algorithms as having biases  And they're not encouraged to think that way by platforms that rely on those algorithms  The the sort of you know, the story is well the algorithm is a magic box  uh that computers run that that  Perform certain functions and I think part of what people like zanup and others are trying to do is to say look  These are products of human beings human beings have biases. They should be treated in the same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like we thought doctors were god  We think the algorithm is god  Right, but we've learned I mean the you know news algorithms have not produced better news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of these companies wave at the algorithm, you know as the kind of the man don't look at the man behind the curtain  Oh, it's just the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and you were saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just makes me think back to  Maybe two years ago at most when all of the techno panic come out about the ai and algorithm  Causing people to lose jobs and  To an extent I could see that because we can build robots to do dysfunction and that function and and not have to hire  manpower to do it  But on the flip side of that I always said well  Why not hire people to help feed the algorithm to help make the algorithm better than what it is right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know because exactly and and I I saw some stories. I was just coming in and it was talking about uh,  More algorithms being more human humans hired  Google said in their in their youtube blog that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Using ai and machine learning doesn't mean fewer human beings. It actually means more human beings  Yeah, on the other hand  I do want the the burger making robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh and and I know it's going to eliminate some jobs, but I want to see the burger making robot operation  You see that story this week. Why would you just keep this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Keep it out there. Don't bring that to my house. I'll cook my own burgers. I don't know  Here is the creator

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a startup restaurant called creator and this is the burger making robot  This is kind of great, isn't it? Oh look at those. Wow look at that  This is john constein at tech crunch  Well, that's not what I thought john constein looked like that's uh, josh josh. I mean, yeah, that's  Josh josh. I mean, yeah, that's he's quite the hipster, isn't he?  So, um, let me see the robot in action. This is the interview but let's see the robot  Well, having worked at a mcdonald's  I was basically a meat robot when I was at the grill at mcdonald's and I could do this by the way a lot faster  And a lot more efficiently. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you all you old guys say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, I could okay  Come come behind the grill with me some time here  Sonny come behind the grill with me. I'll show you whippersnappers  We used to get used to get a tray of 12 regulars, right?  So that's 12 patties they they give you a spatula. That's a foot long so that you can flip six at a time  Yeah, that's right. Yeah foot foot foot  You got the uh, the the ketchup squeezer and the mustard squeezer  Or chay chay chay chay chay chay chay chay chay chay. I could crank out 12 patties in three minutes like that  And they were delicious and they were delicious. They were good eating

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I noticed you said patties. You didn't necessarily say burgers. It wasn't necessarily meat in the patties

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a moment. Look at this. Wait a minute. This is disgusting. This thing is a mess  I don't want to eat this. This is gross. You ordered it wrong. You did everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's ketchup on this sloppy that is the worst  If I did that at mcdonald's I would have been fired  All right, aunt and matthew a junk food experience working experience earlier in your lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I won't say in particular but I did my um, I did my fast food run for a little while and which jane  I know it was pretty much a  You're pretty robotic yourself working on those little lines, you know, because you don't have any thought process on  On what the ingredients are you just see what your order is, you know, there's two ounces of this four ounces of that  Rapid send it period. I just don't know. I just I just read anthony bourdain's kitchen confidential

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and pretty much every kitchen is that the whole point of a  Commer of a commercial kitchen of a restaurant kitchen is to produce identical food every single time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and keep costs down because it's already costing a ton of money just to run that restaurant  So that's how you you know maximize those margins by knowing that it's only four ounces of cheese that goes on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, they got mad at us if we gave them two ketchup packets every ketchup packet is four cents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You gave them one packet manager. I was the kitchen manager at ponderosa steakhouse  And I don't know if you can be able to see this or not. Don't take no offense what i'm about to do  Can you see the difference between those two fingers?  One's shorter than the other. Yep lettuce slicer. Oh god out  Oh  Yeah, yeah, mike the manager who trained me was very short and short stubby fingers  So he when he showed me oh, just don't put with a plunger. Just put the lettuce in use your finger hand  And so I made true chef salad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And somebody got your finger in their salad. Well to to an's point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did debate for a while whether to throw out the lettuce

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That stuff costs money  Yeah, somebody picked that lettuce so I thought that working at mcdonald's and I did that  It was my first job when I was 15 and a half and I did that for three  Every summer for three or four years through half of college and then I worked in the college dining hall  Were some of the best that was a great job you move fast  You you never the worst thing a job is to be standing around right aunt you the the harder you're working  The better the faster the day goes the more I had a great time and I learned how to work  They said you don't ever stand there if you don't have something to do you're cleaning right, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're leaning you need to be cleaning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or as as or or as the lead on the machine. This is not the dishwasher you are. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did you work matt? Did you work at fast food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I never did any fast food. I pumped gas  Okay, I worked at a little gas station and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ran the counter, but I didn't that is not a good job pumping gas. I would far rather

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I really enjoyed it really really enjoyed. Yeah, I don't know why I like the smell of gas, which is weird, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And uh, so I would go home smelling like hamburger grease you'd go home smelling like petrol

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I loved it. I love the smell of gas

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It smells like victory. I could still sing the theme song  Go ahead  If you like your steak give your appetite a break get your steak at the ponderosa steakhouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grab a bucket and mop from the floor to the top. Tell me what does it mean at mcdonald's we're clean  That's my era  I worked in mcdonald's with golden arch with the old-fashioned two golden arches and everything was it was original  Yeah, oh yeah, it still said millions on our sign  Wow  I loved working at mcdonald's the only and  One summer finally, they said, you know, either you have we don't get that you want to have a career here  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think  No, did you try to argue them out of it? Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I think they said look if you're willing to go to hamburger university instead of yale university. We'll think about it  And I said, you know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if all those jobs went away would that be would society be worse off you think I think it was good for us to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those entry-level jobs for each one of us  Were critical in the early days, right? But you could do robot repair now  That's not as much fun  I kind of I don't know. What do you think aunt your kids how old your son is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Getting to that age right 10th grader and is in a seventh grader now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're getting to that age where they might get their first jobs. Are there jobs out there for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  though actually  Here jobs that are available for them would be like a grocery store attendant service  Stuff like that  The the fast food those are going away market of it is is usually for the older kids  Is usually for the the high school seniors and people like that. You gotta work your way up to that. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I still see plenty of people. It's full-time. It's full-time work for a lot of people, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If amazon has its way nobody will be doing working in grocery stores either

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of me is fine with that. Um  Because I like the they're not great delivery system, you know, I like the whole idea of  I need about  Six pounds of ground beef by tomorrow. Can can you work that out?  And I really don't feel like driving across town, you know or better yet. I I need a nice  Six pound pork belly because i'm going to be barbecuing in a couple weeks. You're a real chef. You were you actually were a cook  Hey, i'm a southerner  We we don't mess around when it comes to cooking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There ain't no pork belly in a mcrib sandwich I could tell you that right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true there ought to be but there isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I like the idea of a delivery system from amazon and they have that whole prompt. What's it called prime now?  Yeah, I think that's what it's called and i've i've seen it pop up on my feed or whatever  But a lot of the things that are offered  To date is not of use to me  But i'm sure they're going to expand that and start bringing more things that i'm interested in because yeah, just hey deliver it  i'm all for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody woke up my google somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Earlier today there was I think an outage on the google home. There was let me try it. Yeah google home and chromecast  They weren't talking  Uh, I kept asking my google home because I want there's a thing you can do with the google home. You could say  Look, we'll get did belgium's belgium just scored a goal and it'll go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can say it in country so I just asked asked for this I said well we'll get what  Are you up again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm always on the clock the good news is I love my job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I love my job. Yeah, say tell her uh, tell her somebody just scored some country just scored a goal  Germany  You say germ well, we'll get germany just scored a goal well, we'll get germany just scored a goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Germany just scored a goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I don't know how to help with that. Oh shut up man. Oh, it's still down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ours didn't go down because I assume they have special canadian google home servers. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if i'm, I wonder if that's the right uh syntax  I did the other day. It was so much fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Germany just scored a goal  Uh, it was my syntax it was my bad pronunciation. I think that's fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see the machine is training you. Yeah, exactly. You have to be trained by the machine  Uh, let's see. Where do you want to go? You want to do facebook? You want to do amazon? You have jeff you  You have a story you uh said hold for jarvis the google. I didn't say that carston carston  The google news initiative journalism fellows. Who are these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good looking minor. No, but I think it's really great that uh,  They're all women that they are all women

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, wow at last so that's good. That's cool. So what is the news fellows program?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what this one is the google news initiative is the new thing that kind of expands on what they did in europe  The digital news initiative now is the google news initiative where they said they're investing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what jr. Is the news lab fellowships  They've been going on for quite some time. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is uh, that is really fantastic to see  One two three four five six seven eight women

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although somebody wrote about uh google and facebook funding journalism and how it's problematic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't it is it? Yeah. Yeah, who could have done that who might have been the contrarian trying to argue that I don't know  I remember  It was a good piece matthew. It was a good piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wrote it matthew?  I'm sorry. I'm not in on all the that was matthew's subtle way to plug. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, mr ingraham you care to elaborate on? Yeah. Thank you. It was uh, so I was looking at for the  columbia journalism review I was looking at whether  google and google in particular has  spent hundreds  of millions of dollars funding  fellowships and research and training and  and so the I was just looking at whether that's  Whether there's an inherent kind of conflict there for journalists or for journalistic entities to be  Taking money from large platforms that they are increasingly relying on  for their journalism or for their  business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and of course  I have to do full full disclosure full disclosure matthew talked to me  So i've accepted money from facebook and craig newmark, obviously and uh, the fort foundation and others  But I am independent of facebook and none of their money goes into my pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and matthew you wrote about the fact that both twitter and facebook  uh, in fact recently, I think jack dorsey just had  uh  meetings with sean hannity and a bunch of conservative commentators to reassure them that they weren't  liberal slanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right  And facebook has been doing the same thing trying to convince  conservatives for some time  And the platform isn't biased against them. Yeah, ever since the trending

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  brouhaha

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I think that's so the what the point I tried to make in there is that  You know, it's fine to to try and do that. But it  If you bend over backwards to to reassure  Conservatives that's going to have an impact on what you do on your platform  You could argue that you could draw a line between what happened with trending topics  And then them firing everyone and feeling sort of under the gun about bias and then  You know effectively conservatives and the right wing weaponizing facebook to help elect Donald trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we talked on the show about about the current kerfuffle. There being always a kerfuffle about facebook and  Labeling political ads with the who who places them that we talked about that in the show. No, we know they're doing  That now well, yeah, why is that?  why is there a kerfuffle here's here's why is it a kerfuffle because  um  Matthew correct me if i'm wrong here in your understanding what they've said is  Anything with political content has to be labeled. Well, the new york times does ads promoting their political coverage  and so  Oh, we have to look as requiring them to do the same disclosure  And when they don't they say that facebook has rejected their ad  Now on the one hand, I think the simplest thing to do here is to say if you're a news organization  You're a different thing  But on the other hand we're going to get into a fight right off the bat. Who's a news organization?  Is it bright part is it info wars?  And and so what facebook has tried to argue now in which one more sentence than then  Well, place was trying to argue camel brown did on stage with the new york times new york times went after facebook and her hard  at an event at columbia and and  Campbell brown from facebook came back and said what's wrong with transparency on the behalf of newspapers  My view is that every ad should have full transparency as to who bought it  um  And and that'd be the wise way to go but the way facebook rolled this out once again got them in more hot water

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matthew well and and so what what the new york times and other news organizations have said is that they want to be exempt  From this policy so that they they're from i don't think so  To me if you promote a story, that's an ad that's called an ad and so if it goes into an archive of ads  I don't see how that's  A problem like the the argument. I think that emily bella and others have made is that this that's a very slippery slope if you start  um categorizing  what amount to  news stories promoted or otherwise as political advertising that encourages  Users and readers to see them as somehow biased when they're not so what does she argue in the end matthew?  What does she say facebook?  So i'm, not sure she has an answer  I mean, I think she she said she understands facebook's perspective on it that they are trying to be more transparent  This you know, they're trying to get get on top of the whole advertising problem that that they wound up in front of congress for  And so this is a step that they believe will help do that. They've created two separate archives  One is for news and one is for non-news  So that's kind of their um concession to news organizations. I mean to me  This is a problem that's inherent in facebook's platform a promoted news story just looks like a news story  so it's not  An ad in the same way we kind of think of  Ads, it just looks like a news story. It's it's native truly. Yeah, right  And and that's an inherent so facebook on facebook. Everything can be an ad  And so everything is an ad in a way  So it's kind of it's a it's a definition problem and and we can't facebook can't solve that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, are we just gonna accept that people are going to use facebook for news, right? That's just given

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of whatever they want to use for internet is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And allegedly right? It's their internet. It's the internet. Yeah, so it does have to be solved

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean you you have to somehow solve this issue and yeah, there's another angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that the other sort of aspect that the reason why media companies I think are so upset or part of the reason is because facebook has  Decreased their organic reach  Gradually over time to the point where they have to promote their news stories in order for people to see them  Because they can't rely on organic reach anymore  So on the one hand facebook is saying you have to promote to pay to promote your stories or no one's going to see them  Or that's how it's structured things but then as soon as they promote those stories, so people will see them  They get labeled political advertising  And it's an ad, yeah  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is hard stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's tough. It's very hard and that's and I think that just acknowledging that it's hard is the important part of this  Um, you know  Is i'm going to be working on another project soon out of the cuny i'll talk about it some future week  But try to define what news is then what quality news is those are those are really hard things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just hard. I I would argue that's impossible. I mean quality news  And it goes back to  All the surveys and people trying to focus on trust  Facebook wants to define what's a trusted news source. Well, you and I might have completely different views

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Problem with it is it's a little patronizing to humans like oh we've got to let you know what you could trust or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instead of saying yeah, that's why I think trust is the wrong is the wrong scale  But I think I think that you can so Matthew you really things like the trust project named trust  But in which papers like the washington post and um, the global mail say that they will  Agree to I don't know six or eight standards. They will label opinion versus news  They will put up the names and biographies of their writers and the masthead of the entire publication  That's an indicator of quality and I think there's there's lots and lots of indicators like that  And I think that's fun what you do with that indicator should be up to each individual each platform and and so on  I don't believe in having a white list or black list, but I think doing a better job of  of of gathering and propagating those those indicators those signals  Helps make better decisions because the algorithms are making decisions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and i'm not i'm not saying the trust indicators aren't a good idea  I'm not saying you know fact checking and those kinds of signals aren't a good idea. I think they are a good idea  I just think they're a tiny tiny drop in a very large ocean. Do you do you guys all use do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said you don't watch news channels anymore, but do you get where do you get news? Do you use facebook for news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter is my new speed  And many of the same time right and most of the time links on twitter when you when you get news on twitter do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then drill into whatever the link is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it depends on the source because most of the time like I can't sit here and say I follow cnn  okay, and  The people that I follow they will retweet a cnn or some other news source and  I basically say well if so-and-so retweeted it  I probably should take a look at it that that kind of thing, you know  Because if I just followed cnn and clicked on every single thing  I would end up getting pissed off because some of it is bad in my opinion and it just  Doesn't necessarily add any value to my to my day, you know  But if one of my peers retweets it that's how I go about news of the day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have curated news from your friends. Go ahead. Correct

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use twitter in exactly the same way. I mean to me it's a social news reader  so people that I respect or  Organizations I respect tweet things and and I use that as kind of the way I used to in rss reader

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know and and  Nothing against cnn their job is to report the quote unquote news, but  A lot of stuff that i've seen from the likes of cnn and other news outlets is some things are just  Over sensationalized and i'm like this is non  Not worthy and then the the headlines  Really pissed me off. Um  You know  I write for tech republic so I understand that the idea in  Behind having a good headline to get people to want to click on your story  On your story, but there are a lot of times when stories pop out there  I think the last thing that comes to my mind was  flight  was diverted from  Was diverted to charlotte  That was supposed to go to london  You know and i'm thinking it just didn't make any sense. Where did the flight come from?  You know if did it come from jfk? Did it come from from maryland?  You know, but it made sense when I read the story because the flight was coming out of spain  Uh, well, no, I can't remember it just it was all confused and the headline just didn't make any sense  Now I can't remember the story but the headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Usually headlines are used to manipulate. That's the other thing is it right? You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My argument of this this debate we had was that was I kept on going after the fact that media are who polarized society  media pitted  Red versus blue black versus white 99 versus 1 media invented the business model of clickbait and sensationalism  And all that we accused the platform is up now just following

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The trajectory that we set in media. Well, yeah, but I mean even if a newspaper  Invented clickbait a newspaper was only going to reach  You know, maybe two three hundred thousand people if that  um  you've got  Facebook and google and and even twitter for that matter instagram snapchat have kind of weaponized  Clickbait and turned it into something. Well, no, I think we weaponized it  But it's it's an orders of magnitude bigger problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and was just talking about cnn you're talking about television was the invention of the notion of mass  Look, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My my local my local news station if I were to turn on the television and they do their teaser before they go to the commercial break  You know, it's it's really really played up and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  11 we've been doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your fault and you wait around and you're like that's all that was about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then at the end they play a video that they found on twitter, yeah, that's the that's what really cracks me up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Well, we sound like a bunch of old guys sitting around on a porch saying, you know  They're proud of what ish world ish  Do you think technology can get us out of this I guess is the is the final question. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People can use technology to get us out of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technology can help  All right. Yeah technology didn't cause it all so we can acknowledge you can't solve it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the first fake news was in the first herald tribune in the 1800s  When they were trying to gin this was a great story in fantasy land kurt  And is it anerson?  great book about  fake news the history of  Imaginary stuff in america in order there was a circulation war and in order to gin up circulation  They pretended that telescopes had seen  The lunar that was the new york sun new york sun  That was it the new york the lunar population that is series on the people living on the moon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they had wings and yeah, they had they had scientists talking about  How they lived in these caves and so on and other newspapers picked up the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's been as long as there have been newspapers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So indeed  I just I just finished rereading this magnificent book by elizabeth eisenstein who's the key scholar of get your drinks ready  Gutenberg divine art infernal machine about from gutenberg on to the present and and she has a chapter on newspapers  I just give you one or two quick quotes  Doctors expressed concern about the state of the nation's mental health and sounded alarm is about the effects of sensational journalism on the national psyche  When was that fair? That was in the 1800s?  The

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  German critic quote a newspaper is a business undertaking which produces advertising space as a commodity which becomes saleable only by means of  Non-advertising space right the model's been there forever, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where was it here up until your buddy craig newmark disrupted the whole damn thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite was benjamin franklin actually created a fake news story really and then published it himself  Yeah published it himself in it pretending that it appeared in an issue of an actual newspaper  And it was designed to basically  Get people angry about I think the british empire, um, and he just made the whole thing up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it does strike me that it is neither different in quality or quantity  What fate what's happening on facebook or cnn or anywhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think there's this moral panic here. I think it's  Voltaire said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It reaches different quantity and I think it's different in speed and magnitude speed maybe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so voltaire voltaire said  Uh journalism was discredited by the multitudes of papers which greedy booksellers are published and which obscure writers filled with incorrect  extracts stupidities and lies  But you know these papers were invented for the solace of those who were either too busy or too lazy to read whole books  Rousseau so the periodical is an ephemeral work without merit and without utility

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what exactly about books things were same things about books. Yeah, you couldn't trust anybody could just write a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I found that headline  Oh the headline the headline reads  American airlines airbus bound for charlotte diverted to london airport  That does sound odd doesn't it you know, but then the very first line is  An american airlines jet headed from barcelona spain to charlotte was diverted that makes a little more sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes a lot of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's just sloppy that's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's neither linked nor is it is sloppy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like a lot of a lot of this is driven by the economic model  The only way to make money or the only way lots of media entities have figured out to make money is advertising  and the way to get  Advertising money is to drive clicks in traffic  Although so in order to do that you have to sensationalize your news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do want to point out that the charlotte observer seems to have a real knack for link bait. Here's some other local headlines  Where is the mercedes that a witness says seem to accelerate as it hits cyclists question mark good question  Hunt for serial flasher at virginia shopping center leads to mma fighter, please say  Your tires could become shoes  With this new project here's how here's how and finally rick flair's daughter  WWE star charlotte flair featured naked in espn's body issue man.

Transcript:  That's a that's a that's a that okay. So but your point's well taken jeff, by the way  Let's give her a full plug elizabeth l eisenstein  Divine our infernal or eisen's eisenstein no eisenstein. Yes. Yeah, divine our infernal machine  The reception of printing in the west from first impressions to the sense of an ending. Oh, I want to read this  university of pennsylvania press

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh very interesting your point to your point. I think whether it's clickbait or fake news or I mean, these are human problems  These are that's kind of my point. They're human problems. Yeah algorithm tweaks are not going to solve this problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is not technology but human behavior on technology  So that's not to say that technology shouldn't be designed differently to deal with that  I think that it's true. I I just wrote a book chapter about this and then argued the same in aspen. It's true that  People like me and the technologists were believed too much in openness. It didn't recognize the result  We didn't recognize sufficiently the manipulation that would occur not just economic but also  psychological and political  Um, we haven't been they haven't been open enough. I mean all that's all that's true, but but you're you're all right  This is not this it's not the cause. It's not the solution. It's a fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was on a I was on a panel and trying to remember who was all we do is go on panels, right matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember who was who they had a great analogy and I can't I can't remember who said it  But if if I think of it, i'll mention it and  They said that social media is an accelerant  Uh, it doesn't create problems like political or social or cultural problems. It's an accelerant  For those problems. It's like pouring gas on a fire  So it isn't the underlying problem, but it but it can exacerbate a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Does this let  Twitter and facebook off the hook? No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not at all, but it doesn't it does but we have to be aware of the moral panic  That blames everything on them and then creates legislation regulation around that and there's worse because neither neither

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they create it nor can they cure it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think they are a factor. They have a role they can accelerate there. They can help they should but we have to work with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Them right and part of the problem was the sort of technological solutionism  You know that the kind of utopian idea that a great algorithm can solve society's problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think this all becomes relevant because we're headed into a midterm election  And uh  There's concern  That whatever happened in 2016 could happen again  Mm-hmm. It seems a little late to be worried about it now  But maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's ever ever thus. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hindsight

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's why facebook and twitter have been meeting there was another story about them meeting with  Government and intelligence sources to say hey, can you guys give us a heads up about anything that we should be aware of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were very frustrated because when they met with it they got nothing they got the guys said well  Let's give it tell us everything you know, but we're not gonna tell right  Uh you anything we know  Right. This was a meeting that took place may 23rd at facebook headquarters amazon apple google microsoft oath snap  And twitter were there  The times spoke to three attendees of the meeting  Uh, also their christopher krebs undersecretary for the department of homeland security a representative from the fbi's  newly formed foreign influence task force neither the department of homeland security nor the fbi  Had anything to say about it?  And apparently didn't have much to say at the meeting either basically got shut down  Yeah, they got nothing people attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information only to be told  Repeatedly that no specific intelligence would be shared. I can understand that they for whatever reason well, they want to protect their sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I disagree to this extent  Um, i've talked to people from both facebook and google very high level very frustrated with government because there are  Cases where government knows there are crimes and campaigns and other things going on and they don't share anything  Right and in the case of russian manipulation if they're not sharing information to try to stop it  See that smells a little suspect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, and in fact  Others at the intelligence agencies have testified in congress and other places that the russians are already well at it  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think they need to provide sources  They could have just said look these are some general patterns that we're seeing or there's other, you know  Internet research agencies or things like them and we've seen them meddling in this or that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it well didn't have to but they told the senate that they said russia's using fake accounts on social media  Many of them bots to spread disinformation  European elections being targeted to as brexit was the we expect russia to continue using propaganda social media  False flag personas sympathetic spokespeople and other I mean, it's the same playbook they used last time  So it's not like these companies don't know what happened last time  I wonder if I mean, okay, I hear what they're saying, but is this a little bit of saying well, they didn't tell us anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing we can do about it. No, no, no, no either. I've heard them personally. They're very very frustrated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what do they want? I mean, they know what's going on. They know about bots  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's a and facebook kills a million a million bad accounts a day  What they want is some measure of intelligence to be able to know better to go it goes back to the al franken moment at the  At the hearings some time ago when franken said rubles you should have seen because it was rubles  Well, they didn't know to look for rubles  They didn't know this was going on now that they know they need clues and signals and government's not cooperating  And g once again, it has to do with this administration in russia. Sorry to get political for a moment here  But I think it's all the more reason why they should be revealing  Um in some way or another so the government's not helping them at all  Zero, well the platform is trying to do what they're trying to do. The platforms are on hot water  The government's not helping them at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the it's a classic meeting though. I mean the fbi or whoever you meet with them. They're not going to like hand over information  The number one thing they're going to do is try and get information out of you. So they're going to try and get you to help them  More than they're going to help you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And i'm not sure that that's unreasonable  Uh twitter has done some things. I mean today they announced new new plans to make it harder to  Create spoof email accounts to create accounts on twitter  Um, they are I think twitter is doing as much as it can to make sure that account creation  Um is harder for bots, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they said their ai is getting better in terms of spotting suspicious account creation, so hopefully that's gonna  help  The thing that troubles me, I mean facebook, I don't know if you guys remember facebook came out with its own  internal security report  um looking at bad actors and bad behavior on the platform before the russian thing blew up and there were  There were some significant reports from insiders that  The report was basically  Um cleaned up so that russia wasn't mentioned as a big factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so so this fake this is a two-way street  That troubles me. It seems easy to blame the fbi. I didn't tell us anything when they're doing this  They're doing what they're accusing the fbi of doing  I don't know  Attempted to just to give up on the whole damn thing  You know, uh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are things the platforms could do that are positive like get out the vote campaigns, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even that's controversial because you know, it does not have bias in it for who well don't say for who just say everybody needs to vote  Get out there. Well, but voter suppression is the largest issue that we really have in this election voter suppression is the entire issue  So trying to get the vote out is a political act. I agree with you  They should it should be mom and apple pie, but even that isn't in this crazy world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook did an interesting experiment where they  Allowed you to say, you know, I voted. Yeah, you could sort of put a flag. I thought that was cool  Yeah, they did that in the primary here and they tracked it and they found that it increased voter participation by measurable amount

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes  It put and now's the time to say are you registered to vote? I I don't see how that that's controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that because people you dig into the people's uh, what is it fomo fear of missing out?  Oh wait a minute. You got a little check mark on their avatar. Yeah, I want that. I want the button

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they should make it really cool looking like an animated gift or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so yesterday of twitter  Published how twitter is fighting spam malicious automation  um  They're showing the number of accounts challenged. This is this graph has gone up significantly  um  And then it went down and then went down but it's back up again to a peak now in may it was 10 million accounts challenged  we're removing twitter says  214 more accounts for violating spam policies year over year  the average number of spam reports we three through our  Received through our reporting flow continued to drop  I guess that's a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what was interesting to me in that in that facebook report was it wasn't bots or spam  Or fully automated accounts that were the biggest  Problem or they were the most interesting  It was semi automated or bot like accounts  So people where there was a real human being  Theoretically behind the account but they were basically mimicking sort of bot like activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a really really hard thing to detect because they look human. They are human exactly. That's that's yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the the the thing that a big takeaway that I took from  facebook's report was that  And and intelligence sources say the same thing the majority of the activity was not designed to try and convince people  To move from one side to another it was just designed to create chaos and uncertainty  That's the goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  But then then did you all watch the paul wakartney?  karaoke link cars video

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't I wasn't gonna watch it because um, I can't sit here and say i'm a big beetles fan or anything like that  But I respect the the art, you know what i'm saying?  And boy, i'm glad I watched that video. Yeah, you know and i'm bringing it up for two reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cheap. Uh, uh segue I admit but it also you know in leo's and my grandpa's grandpa's age  You know the 60s and the beetles  And it was amazing to see because what that what that era meant in terms of fighting on the barricades and people at risk  And government doing things we didn't want and all of that and yet there was a voice of  of um  Uh anguish and hope from the beetles and it just brought it back out again. It was just I was I was in tears  That's me it just made you happy to see paul. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so that's why I didn't watch it. But then eventually I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen it yet. Well, you haven't seen it yet. Oh leo watch the entire thing  The entire thing so just take a take any moment. Are you allowed to have music on the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't I can't hear it. Are you are you do you have me potted up? I'm i'm up  Oh, sometimes we have problems with the audio anyway, I think technology effing technology  We usually try to check this before we do the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have everyone in the audience if you haven't watched the whole thing take my word for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take ant's word for it watch the entire thing. I I do think james cordon in the beetles wig  Or a sergeant pepper outfit  That's pretty funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just find them incredibly annoying. So that's why I sort of like him. You don't like him. I like him. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great. It's really great. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, it's good. It's so much for that effort for a musical interlude

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why I have these troubles audio is hard california, uh kind of  I'm sad to say, uh  Blinked on that neutrality. Yeah, so explain the political angle there. What are the rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would think with silicon valley  Is it is it is it back to sopa pipa is it is it hollywood versus silicon valley one of the one of the  Sides in this that you'd think that california would be easy to pass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it came from uh, uh miguel, uh, santiago who apparently  Did not want the zero rating  Uh provisions and of course zero rating is a big issue, but it's a tough issue because it's hard to convince  I think voters that something that saves the money is bad for them  Same with amazon, right? Yeah  Uh, and actually people I think he's in orange county, uh assemblymen people have started to take out  Somewhere in southern california people started somebody bought a billboard in orange county saying  Remember, he's the guy who torpedoed net neutrality california  Washington state though does have a good net neutrality  bill  Law, so at least there's one state that has it. I you know, it's funny. I don't know if this is related  But I was looking at this variety  uh lineup of at&t  Their new wireless plans will make it free to watch  What a surprise a bunch of at&t properties. Yeah  Convenience  So this is what we're talking about when we talk about zero rating is that at&t which has acquired time warner is now going to make  A bunch of time warner stuff free on at&t wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is why comcast once um, not only

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And why would that be a bad thing consumers say well, that's great. It's free. Well because then you  Are right. This is picking winners

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is exactly what everyone was talking about when net neutrality first became a debate  This is the future where the carrier or the cable company that you choose determines what content you get because it's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, the other way to put the problem is it's fine if you have at&t, but if you have verizon or t-mobile  Um, maybe you can't get it. Maybe it'll be really expensive there  uh, and and so it's a it's a  Fencing of content maybe that appeals to consumers. I don't know. It's a really hard message to cross

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if you're an at&t customer you go great now I can watch hbo for free  No, not hpo or not hpo cnn amc cartoon network tbs tnt all the time warner stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um exclusivity has been around forever though, you know, just remember you remember the iphone you couldn't get it unless you were using  At&t's really really bad service back in the days. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true  but that but content like news and  I'm just I think zero rating is a slippery slope you could argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That the reason the iphone is so dominant in the united states  I mean it helped at&t and it helped the iphone didn't it it did  And I think you can very much argue that if a phone doesn't get carrier support like phil zimmerman's black phone  It's dead in the water  And when xiaomi had a phone that they thought they had at&t and verizon all signed up for and then the federal government  Lay, you know put pressure on  Carriers. Oh don't carry those chinese phones  So at&t and verizon dropped them and it and it practically put xiaomi  Out of business. It certainly did put them out of business in the u.s  So yeah, these are  I don't think it's good for consumers competition is good for consumers, but it's hard to explain  Why saving you money is a bad thing it really is and uh, but I think if you if you explain to people how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know you like netflix, right?  And so sure great netflix might be zero rated for you  But what if something comes along that's better than that? Yeah, it's an opportunity cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody understands opportunity costs and you're talking about something  You know imaginary the next netflix. Yeah, what is that? I don't know. I like netflix. I'm happy to get it for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do I need a new netflix human being you're talking about the amazon brand buster story?  That's a fascinating story isn't it's really actually related because amazon can come in and because it has the mechanism to  Promote to market to recommend  to make and distribute  It can beat all kinds of brands and consumers will say  And then it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anomaly then it's a little sneaky because if you search for underpants  Uh, and you might get amazon basics

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you might get that smile on my underpants and you might get good briefs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what you might not know is there all it's both amazon. Oh amazon  They have 100 private label brands and why would you do that? Well so that you can do these recommendations and not be seen to be  favoring yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spotted zebra as kids close their power. Yeah, but on the other hand, you know macy's has house brands  Oh, it's good for consumers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  amazon was good for consumers in book prices until  They had a monopoly and then it was bad for consumers. Yeah, true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem the hard part is you've got companies like amazon that are  It's hard to define whether they're monopoly. They're monopoly in some things. They're a monopoly in  You know certain vague  Vaguely define things facebook is a monopoly and I don't know social connections  Is that even a market and yet so we don't we literally don't even have the terminology to talk about  the things that these companies are monopolies, no, it's a new way of of monopoly and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very difficult. I you know, I went down to our local bookstore after anthony bourdain's death about a week later  I wanted to get kitchen confidential from my son because I wanted him to read that before he took a job in the restaurant  Industry, which you wanted  And uh, and I went and they said oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the um gadget makers bracing for trump's trade war  Right. Yeah, this is kind of an interesting back and forth. Yeah, what's going to happen to an iphone in china?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tim cook who's you know, there was a great picture on the new york times of a two-faced tim cook facing  A president she of china and president trump of the u.s  and playing both against the other of course china is uh,  Vital to iphone manufacture most iphones are made there. Uh trump has promised the administration has promised not  to uh tariff  phones or tvs  um on the other hand  Uh, if we have, you know, we've got 250 billion dollars of tariffs on china  There's nothing that could stop that would stop china from retaliating in other ways for instance  tariffing incoming  parts for iphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, that's that's the issue right say we're on cars. This is the problem with um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess trade wars i've never lived through one, but uh, there's a lot of  Well, I don't know if we are yet or if it's just posturing I mean it hasn't it's coming you think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  We got really good aluminum too. I'm not lying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's it's un it's unclear  uh, right and you know, honestly, I think the american  I don't hear a lot of people saying uh, oh is my iphone going to cost I I don't think that it's that price sensitive for one thing  Uh, I mean my god this iphone 10 is a thousand dollars. That's the you gotta point there. Yeah, so it's an interesting  Market  Yeah, and then um  I think people are honestly, I think more worried about their uh retirement funds  And their their 401ks and all of that  And but the problem is that could also be collateral damage in a trade war

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I heard somebody on msmsd as I was driving here speedily to get to the show say that um  The 40 40 40 odd percent that trump has he calls them the the 401k voters  As long as the 401k is in good shape, you know, that's well, that's why he's in the 40s

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not the 30s, but will it will it be is a good question  Uh, if you look at apple's, uh stock price over the last month it has come down a bit  um  Probably over these trade fears, but again the iphone is so far exempt  So I you know, it's just it's so hard to uh  So hard to figure this stuff out to be honest with you. I know  I I don't understand any of it  I should read more facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you should well. I got another question for you. Have you been playing with ig tv?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a good one. What do you guys think?  Uh, and are you using I know you do the friday night youtube videos. Are you looking at ig tv as another venue for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually planned on releasing a video with my thoughts on this but in but in short

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well here do it here and well, you can edit it and put it on ig tv  No, no  No, you have to turn the ants monitor this way before you do that. We actually posted some stuff, uh on ig tv  Uh, I guess our people are have jumped on the ig tv bandwagon  But because it's vertical video and we shoot normally  Like oh you we the edges are all cut off and all the lower thirds and all the information is weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to plan all of that and I think it's a decent idea, but you have to  Plan forward and and also figure out  What your strategy is because I personally don't want my youtube content  To be replaced by ig tv i'd rather use ig tv  As an option to get you over to my youtube content  Or use it the way I did with today's video  It's just giving you a behind the scenes and a thought process kind of quick tip and tricks because I don't think anybody's going to watch  Something on their phone for 10 minutes or eight minutes or five minutes like that  You're just not going to do it  But I could still give you two minutes something like that of decent content  In that same aspect ratio without an issue as long as I plan for it and make sure that I shoot in that particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aspect ratio this is uh, what if this video right now I got is i'm watching you  No, what are you looking at looking at my there you go. Yeah, there it is. That's this morning. Yeah, that's this morning  So a 16 views two comments  Uh, it's a couple of minutes long get out earlier or stay out later. I like that. I like that  uh  I don't know  By the way, I keep doing that you got to swipe up from the middle and then you can and then you can see the other stuff  I'm not sure by the way, you were number one on for me. Look at that  So that's where you that's where you want to be. I don't know how they know  I don't know how they know there. Here's another uh, twit review. So we're putting we're  We're oh look they act. That looks great. Yeah, they did a little editing to make sure it all fit in  But you are cheating  Because we're using  Well, the other thing about igtv is it doesn't have live streaming you it it is designed for you to upload video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've done live streaming on i'm cool. Not igtv. Sorry. No, you can live stream on instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what I and they say I think that there will be live streaming but right now what happens  Is you uh now look at this. That's really cheating  They have  Yeah, they have a landscape video  On that's you know, that's not going to work shira  Yeah, that's more like your gopro knows what they're doing  Justine, of course, she knows what justine of course is on top of it. So what is this? Is this a challenge to youtube?  Is it a challenge to  Allegedly snapchat, what's it a challenge to what is it gonna more so towards youtube because youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not youtube because instagram went directly to the big youtube creators and said hey  This is what we're getting ready to do. So can you jump on board and mr?  Marquez brownlee was one of those people right away. Yep, right away right away

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oh tell us about vidcon  IG tv came out at vidcon, right? Yes. Yes. So what was the reaction there vidcon, which is really a youtube event pretty much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the interesting thing. It really I saw was on one panel  Where the moderator up at the industry tracks said, you know, this always was seen as the as a youtube conference youtube conference  Not really this year because as we as we listed last week  Everybody's doing video  IG tv had a huge booth of you know, really tall vertical monitors  They had a lounge just like youtube they had their own lounge their own swag somewhere. I've got a t-shirt here  And uh, so  No, there was talk about every platform. It wasn't just youtube and and on youtube they didn't send susan rojiski this year  They sent they had a product and they really didn't make any announcements  It really struck me that everything youtube announced you had to have either 10 000 or 100 000  Uh subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have 100 000 subscribers you could charge 4.99 a month  And have subscriptions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is aimed at patreon I would guess right. Yeah, so I saw I saw jack there and he was kind of rolled his eyes a little  bit saying everybody's doing  Go ahead  Well, just real quickly. So by the way, I think that that notion of charging, you know  I'm not a big fan of paywalls, but but patronage I do think has real value  And I think there's a new model of born in here in being able to charge on on youtube  We'll see whether it works or not, but also facebook groups  I think it's an opportunity for media to start charging for if if it's valuable enough if it's good if it's a gate  So that's that's an interesting model. It's come out across both those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is what is say I mean youtube a lot of the reason why people  Are there creators are there is because they get revenue  I mean the reason why lots of them have moved over to facebook watch is because there's no revenue for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon had a big presence. They had a they had the entire lounge on what is amazon's offering twitch is that  No, no amazon's offering merch  merch  Yeah, your own merch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the idea is he's in twitch where?  I think it's called twitch prime. You know, if you if you follow someone on twitch, you know, that's another way of  of um  Contributing to the people you follow by using twitch prime. So all of your purchases sends a couple nickels  To whoever you follow on twitch, you know, that's one little leg up and it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You correct me if i'm wrong. You're our local expert  That if you're a creator, you don't want to look at any one platform  You don't want an exclusive with anybody you want to use each platform for what it's best for ig tv a good way to promote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To push people towards your youtube that's my that's that's my theory and that's the strategy I use because each of those platforms have  Individual audiences, you know the people that follow me on twitter. Yes are not the same that follow me over on google plus  Yes, I still use google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, you have to tell you this terrorist  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's a it's a big difference and when I go through my week of planning out content creation  You know, I I try to figure out okay  Once I got this piece of content where am I going to share it and how i'm going to share it?  You know because I could that's the right way to do it, but it's expensive  Or just put some personality behind it and put it on  If i'm going to put it on instagram  I got to figure out a clever way to put it there to make it relevant to those folks on instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's mine requires a lot more thought and effort

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like you're pretty dedicated to youtube like that. That's your sort of main home. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for now it is because it's the easiest platform for me to to  to share  The little bit that I know and what i've learned  And being able to to live stream pretty seamlessly it's been it's been great and plus the whole se  Seo model behind it, you know, it's the second largest search engine on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do you are you bothered by what looks like a?  Effort on youtube's part to keep people from mentioning other streams and other places  They banned people for saying come watch my twitch stream for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw a bunch of big channels take a hit because of that and  I guess youtube has the right to do that because it is their product that you're trying to profit off of you know  I don't I don't think about it too much, but it sort of made sense to me  You know if i'm going to sit there and be touting my ipad  I'm not necessarily going to talk about just how great google maps is on it versus apple maps  Well, the apple might not like that this is though a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Encounter to what you just said which is the best thing for a creator to do is to be in a bunch of platforms  Use the platform natively appropriately  But if the plat but the from the platform's point of view and you could see this in the ig tv announcement which featured  Creators in the and i'm sure at vidcon which features creators  It's the superstars of individual platforms that make the platforms happy they want  They want you to be loyal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  it's and and  For me, I will say i'll be more loyal to youtube just because of you know what I provide  I don't think my long-form content is a good fit on instagram because instagram or ig tv, whatever you want to call it  is people  Scrolling through with short attention spans. You're you're literally just scrolling scrolling through you're not there to consume several minutes  That's why the ig stories work as well as they do because they're 15 seconds at a time  Right, you know, but you can take a video and put it in your instagram feed  And you know hope that somebody's going to watch it because you can put up to 60 seconds  But I guarantee you put it on the stories  You get a lot more more views and clicks there because it's just the whole attention span

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  instagram's got to watch out because ig tv could end up being a wasteland of  Advertising product placement  Um, it could this is one of the big problems I have in general with instagram is a lot of these instagram stars use their popularity  To basically do advertising on there. Yeah, not that we would ever do that, but  It just seems a little bit more advertising focused like that's the point of the feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I look out a little bit because most of the people I follow on the instagram platform are  Dedicated photographers because that's what I love. I love to look at  The photographs I love the craft behind and trying to get into their head to see  How do they come up with that particular shot? How do they come up with that composition?  and most of those folks they're not really doing a lot of the the  Ad worthy stuff, you know every now and then they'll do a story to show you the behind the scenes but  Beyond that this is you know  They'll post something every other day that kind of thing because they're working on their craft and then they're going to share it  You know, they're not doing a whole lot of spamming and stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's exactly who I follow and I guess that's the saving grace of instagram  Is you only see what you follow minus the ad every eight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get that little banner at the top that says so-and-so just posted on ig tv  And i've now trained myself to ignore that because most of the time it's people that i'm not that interested in I followed them  But i'm not that interested in them. Well, that is trey racliff did it. I probably look that is the different model of ig tv because it has this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The following tab is just one of you know three for you following and popular  A lot of the content on ig tv is not from people you follow but  Nope, but from people they are promoting like this aunt pruett guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will also say  Clemson and I get nothing from clemson university, but they are doing a really good job on ig tv and how they're using it  Really? They you can tell they planned it you can tell they sat down  And planned it out far as how they want to make this shot work and and go through their scripts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet they started with snapchat though, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um more so with uh  I think it was snapchat but they got the clemson social media team  Got really really big a couple years ago and they ended up at adobe max adobe said  Please come out here and show everybody how are you creating this great content and come to find out they were using adobe products  And all that good stuff, but it's just  The thought process that goes into it is what what really sets them apart and now all the little college  Colleges and whatnot are doing the same type of thing  Because that's how you get players to come there. You know, they see your social media presence. All right, that's smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I think that if at least my bet is if you were to look at what  IG tv is aimed at it is it is aimed to be the final nail in the snap coffin  That and not because creators will move there because a lot of the people use snapchat use snapchat because it's it's it's not so public  right, but that's where the revenue comes from is all the brands like clemson and everybody else putting their stuff in the discover tab and  And I guarantee you that's the plan for ig tv is let's just suck all the revenue out of snap. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seems like that's been the plan from day one. No, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right pretty much  So that if you if you I i've been thinking about it, it's not targeted at youtube because people like you will use both  Uh, it it is not gonna hurt instagram because it's very different  It's really it's like oh let's a get another icon on the desktop another set of notifications and b

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's put let's let's kill do you think snap has a chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at this point no, uh, it's funny though. I may not be the right person to ask because uh,  It's on the demographies the demographic young people love snap, but my kids still use a snap my kids still use it  Yeah, yeah mine too for private communication though, right? Right. So that's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think they're like I think there's still a use case for that. There's still a use case for the sort of oh I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if your instagram, you know, you can't or facebook you can't kill that because facebook's very much the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can kill their revenue revenue, right? How do you generate revenue after the revenue?  Means sharing short snaps of themselves doing something goofy like not it's not that there's not a need  Is it a big business? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I should be concerned about the business model, but it's just yeah  I don't I don't think it bodes well for the long-term survival of snap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanted to mention uh regarding vidcon  uh  I think the last time I was on here we discussed, you know using a chromebook for what I do in the content creation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'd like to bring this up. Yes. Yes. Yes, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a I had a one of those virtual conference calls with adobe prior to vidcon and the whole embargo stuff or whatever  But they released project rush  And basically it's allowing you to have  A video editor on your mobile devices, but it's it's just not stripped down. It's pretty daggum powerful  Links into your creative cloud account and all of that stuff  But not only can you do it on ios and android?  but you can also use a chromebook with the the um  google play version of it  Or you're going to end up being able to do it on the web as well  And this is not just just simple iMovie like video editing. This is you can put um  Um motion graphics and things like that in it as well and it's I was so pumped up  During that presentation and just are you in the beta?  Yes, sir. I signed up for it  I wrote about it briefly over on tech republic if anybody in the chat room wants to check that out  But it's i'm just so excited about it because now I I can I have the chance to grab my chromebook  And do some nice quick video. It's does the editing occur locally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, does the editing occur locally?  Right, it's locally

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can make some changes in your you can make some changes to your cloud stuff to sync up to later  Like if I want to change a template today  And then I can pull it down tomorrow on another device and work with it  But if I want to change it tomorrow, I can  Change it send it back up to the cloud and it'll it'll stay there  You know because I personally I use a lot of different lower thirds and templates  Motion graphics inside of my videos right now  That are just just sort of standard things  And it would be nice if I could grab those things when i'm in a hotel somewhere and actually use them instead  instead of having to be on my  beast right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I you know, I don't know how I missed this. I did not i'm so glad you brought this up. I had no idea  So this is timeline style editing  Yep, how does it compare to premiere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is a lighter version of premiere  But in addition to that you get a lighter version of adobe audition to edit audio inside of it  Yeah, you know so and like they have this um auto doken  Auto-ducking feature inside of audition right now that easily integrates in premiere pro  I use it all the time what if you don't know what audio auto-ducking is it's um  You have a video and you have your music bed below it  And if somebody starts talking in your video the music automatically  Ducks down to a lower gain  And when they stop talking it  Automatically comes back up because it's transitioned to another scene. You get that functionality in project rush

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least laugh at that though. How hard is it to just duck the audio down a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, trust me when you're going through clips after clip after clip it takes a lot of time any automation is a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes up a lot of time it is compatible with premiere  It looks like that you can do it on mobile as well as desktop as well as chrome and that all the edits sync  So it's clearly post, you know saving an edit decision list of some kind  So kind of like adobe lightroom where you can make edits on a mobile device, but then they says android is coming soon. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Phone tablet desktop all of this stuff out before the end of the year  I'm i'm, I think they told me like no  Was it november? They told me have you posted any videos with it yet?  No, they they haven't released the beta just yet. Oh, I just let you sign up for it  Okay, but the second I get that email you better believe I already got some files ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say please provide a link to a recent video you shared online. Can I just put twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You probably can do that just put me we are the old report well, I would love to i've signed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we'll see if I can throw out everything you have and just get chromebooks leo just get rid of all that expensive stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't that change your whole perspective on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, and that's what and that's what i've been begging for. I was like the chromebooks are great devices and  There's always just one little hiccup when it comes to creating content now if you're a writer  It's it's no big deal. You can just open up google docs and write your story  But when it comes to editing raw files from your canon camera you have a few limited options  You know and then getting into the world of video editing that was a whole different ball of wax

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

All right, I like it and we are gonna do an ad for lighthouse  I'm very pleased actually to see that lighthouse is back. I use the lighthouse  In fact, I was just I was just looking at my lighthouse at home because it's nobody's home and it said there was  There was activity. I got a notification. There was activity  While nobody was home. So I wanted to see lighthouse is a smart camera that can distinguish between humans  and uh and pets and people and uh  So I can see for instance show me people within the last 24 hours  I have my lighthouse pointed at the front door in my office where my iMac pro sits  I don't want anybody stealing my iMac pro and oh, that's good. It's just it's just the housekeepers doing the the bimonthly vacuuming  And it's nice to see that they're actually doing my office so I can keep track of that  But this is so cool lighthouse knows who we are  So one of the issues for lisa having a camera in the house  She said I don't want a camera on in the house when i'm home  So the minute lisa or i comes home the camera turns off  I could see events and even better I can set up  Notifications anything happen while I was gone ping me if you see anything between 10 and 5  Do you see any new people because it knows who it's seen before it even knows pets  What did the dog do while I was gone or the cat?  Ping me if you don't see the cat by 10 ping me if you see the kids with the cat  What did the kids do when I was gone?  There's another nice feature for kids younger kids, especially love it the lighthouse not only has a very good  High quality camera and night vision and 3d sensing. It's got actual  uh time of flight  3d imaging in it  So that's how it knows people and animals versus, you know objects but you can even  Recognize it can even recognize waving. So if the kids go up to the lighthouse and wave at it, you'll get a notification  You know michael's waving at us and then it has a speaker and a microphone. You can talk to them, too  This is 3d sensing an ai technology that came from self-driving cars  One of the founders of lighthouse was actually a competitor  In the grand challenge the upper grand challenge the self-driving vehicles there really is nothing like the lighthouse out there  It has been praised as the best ai home security around it.
