See she's floating along, little puffy little cloud.  What up?  What up?  Gina is the blogger at smarterware.org, creator of Lifehacker, and she writes and works, not  just writes anymore for Fast Company, does video for Fast Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My first video came out today.  Yay!  Yeah, fastcompany.com slash worksmart.  It's not Leo's, but it's the first episode.  Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fastcompany.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slash worksmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slash, I'm typing it right now, slash worksmart.  And is worksmart the name of your show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the name of the series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With Gina Trapani.  There she is.  A weekly productivity Q&A.  It's an Apple TV ad.  Is there?  Oh yeah, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the smart meeting notes.  It's the top post is the new video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's an ad, not an ad, that's a post.  Yeah, that's a post.  It kind of does look like an ad though, I don't blame you.  It sure did.  Apple TV transformed, given market killing price of $99.  What they left out here is Google breathes a sigh of relief, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Amazon too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Amazon too, and Roku, and a lot of people, Samsung, a lot of people in this business  of television, internet television and apps, I think must have watched with trepidation  as Apple entered the market.  In this case, Apple I think chose to be a pretty conservative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the one thing you think that they should have done, could have done to be constructive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You bought one, so they must have done something right, Jeff.  The price.  Simple.  You bought it just because it was cheap-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and as I said before, I've already gotten crap from people.  You can spare me people, I've already gotten lots of Twitter jokes about how I'm going  to re-box it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what you did with the iPad.  So the idea is Apple TV was always, Apple says, a hobby.  They announced this with a slide that said, one more thing and thing was crossed out and  said hobby.  So they're clearly not attempting to take over the world here.  But they reinvented Apple TV, taking out any storage, putting the A4 chip in it, making  it much smaller, no fan, no power brick, silent.  And because it doesn't have any storage, it's a streaming device only.  They announced 99 cent television show rentals.  Rentals, not purchases.  They said no more purchases, because where would you put it?  And since they don't have cloud storage yet, you can't store it with Apple, so 99 cents  and you have to rent it for two days.  Movies will be $2.99 to $4.99 depending on how new they are.  I'll tell you where I think they went wrong, Jeff.  I think they had a huge opportunity, given that it is obviously an iOS device running  an A4 chip, to put apps on it.  I really, really thought they were going to basically do an iPhone with an HDMI connector  and perhaps an iPhone remote control, an iPad remote control, or even the Magic Trackpad,  but sized for that screen.  And apps would have been huge.  It would have given companies like Fox and NBC and ABC a chance to make their own app  to go right to the users.  Netflix would have been an automatic, because Netflix is already on the iPhone and the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google TV is going to be Chrome based, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's Android based.  Android based.  It will have apps.  Well, we guess so.  That's what they demoed, right?  And so Google now suddenly can steal a march on them.  We talked about it a lot on MacBreak Weekly and the consensus was Apple was conservative  here and probably felt like Google would fumble it.  So they weren't too worried, but I think this was Apple's last chance to make a preemptive  move.  They could have gone in there so strong, given how many apps there are out there, how many  partnerships they have with apps, that would have just knocked Google out of the box.  Gina, what do you think?  You didn't buy one, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not buy one, but they did nail the price point.  I mean the price point on all the things that they announced today was really very, very  tempting.  It does seem like they had to refresh Apple TV to have something to compete with Google  TV, which is due out for the holiday season, right?  So we're probably looking at November, December, right?  I'm not sure if Google gave a release date.  They didn't.  They didn't.  They didn't.  But man, it's sexy, it's small, it's gorgeous.  I can totally understand why Jeff bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already have one of these.  This is a Roku box.  Actually, you do too, because we sent you one.  You do too, thanks to you.  And it does all of the things.  We get Netflix on it.  We can get Amazon rentals as well as purchases.  It's got an app store that puts Twit on there, Pandora, all your slideshows.  It really has the functionality.  In fact, it has the functionality plus of the Apple TV.  It's just a little bit bigger, but not much.  I can still hold it in the palm of my hand.  Why Gina, would you buy, or actually I should ask you, Jeff, why would you buy that when  you've already got this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to blame you when my wife asks why you buy this.  Well, I'm on this week at Google.  I have to know these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so this is the problem with all of us.  We buy these things because it's our job.  But if you were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's somebody in Twitter, a German correspondent named, let me give him his credit, Carsten  Lemm, who says it made a gadget an impulse buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's $99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $99, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't people buy Roku boxes?  They're $89.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just don't have the brand recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what you said on your MacBreak show was that it also syncs with my world in iTunes.  Yeah.  That's powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, that's another thing Apple announced that kind of relates to us.  They announced a social network called Ping that's built into iTunes.  It's music sharing, music discovery, artists.  It has a Twitter model where you can follow people or you can be more public, but you  could have a completely private feed if you want.  Again, I thought lacking courage.  I thought it was an opportunity to preempt a Google Me and perhaps steal a march on Facebook  and Twitter.  It certainly puts my space out of business because now if you're an artist, I don't know,  do independent artists get to create accounts on there?  I don't know.  If you're an artist, it seems to me that's an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  But can you get to Ping in the browser?  You have to use iTunes, right?  You have to use iTunes.  That is just such a bad idea.  It's very retro.  Yeah.  I mean, the idea of connecting to my Facebook account and iTunes just makes me want to hurl.  I'm just like, double twist me, please.  I can't deal with that idea.  It feels like just another reason why I don't want to use iTunes.  Why would you build a whole other web browser?  I mean, suddenly you're browsing web content and iTunes.  I don't know.  I mean, I think this is going to work for a lot of people who are just super invested  in their iTunes library.  I think there are a lot of people that are after having five or six iPods over the years.  But yikes.  I mean, if you can't get to Ping in the web browser, it's like useless.  I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think more the fact that you can't get it through Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're not clear about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just make a Facebook app for this.  There are competitive music taste apps in Facebook people are also invested in.  This is really Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is 100% Apple.  It's the garden, our way or the highway.  You do it within our universe.  They certainly make money at this.  I don't think it promotes anything that you and I think is any good.  It's not about the link economy.  It's not open.  It's proprietary.  It's not social.  It's not social, really.  It's social within our limited.  It's not social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is as social as an 80s disco, I guess.  has the velvet velvet rope, the walled garden, whatever you want to say.  And I think that's the issue for both Google and Apple is that they're just not social  companies.  Apple's a design company and Google's a tech company and Facebook is a social company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  That's why Facebook wins over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They understand.  I don't know if I said this when I was up there in the cottage, if I did stop me, Leo.  But when I talked to Zuckerberg when I interviewed him about the idea that he was creating a  data for data economy and he said, no, you're you're the wrong framing.  It's an interaction for interaction.  The reason people do this stuff is to interact with other people, get information and things  like that.  And so he's you know, he's just always looking at it in a social frame.  And Apple can't and Google can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did did Steve look particularly mean sad and muted when he was discussing the social stuff  and then kind of perk up when he talked about that?  That's what my friends were like.  Steve seems morose.  He hates social networking.  It's like he had to do it.  He had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could very well be.  It could very well have been demanded by the labels because of course the big winners on  this are artists and labels who are going to create artist pages, sell more records.  And I'm sure the labels were saying, look, iTunes is going to get out of date if you  don't put some social in it pretty damn quick.  So I think it may well be just the labels made him.  That's how Steve acts when the labels make him do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the last time Apple did social?  Back to the days when way, way, way back when.  What was their, what was their portal and access service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the name of that?  Was mobile me social at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never.  No, no, they had a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Way back when they had their own basically access service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I was a member and they even they had like a picture of a town and you were moving  around.  It was their own AOL.  Yeah.  And it was a big flop.  Chat room, chat room.  What was the name of that?  E world.  Was that it?  Was that what they say?  I guess it was E world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a bunch of people say E world.  Dot Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was so little remembered.  Clearly it made an impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if there's a, was that their last and only time to do social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  As far as I know.  So so so Apple has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you Google Apple E world, of course you get the images for old times sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  They couldn't jump off the cliff.  They couldn't quite bring themselves to to go after Facebook or go after Google.  Does Google now have an opportunity with Google TV and can they make it happen?  Can they execute?  I think they have an opportunity, but I think there's a lot of reasonable questions about  whether they can execute on that opportunity.  There's the E world.  Isn't that cute?  I remember that very well.  It's that Mac system seven look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What year was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  That was a long time ago.  You know what?  She probably wasn't born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so frigging depressing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina!  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  You were three years old.  Ten!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes!  Ten!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you old lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, at that age she was probably programming for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was starting to learn basic at ten.  I was.  On my PC junior.  I didn't have a Mac when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So once again, does Google now have an opportunity?  There are even people out there who say, oh, is it 1994 or 1996?  It was the early 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was before browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple Link was 85.  So E-world was 1994 to 96.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Tom is in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was timed with the launch of the commercial browser in October of 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, something happened called the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mosaic.  Mosaic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People didn't really want a browser anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, Google is making deals with hardware manufacturers.  That's maybe one advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there are those who say this isn't ever going to happen, that Google will never be  able to get this to happen, that Google TV is pie in the sky.  You think we'll actually see a device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you get down to it in the end, if you can bring Android or Chrome to the TV, that's  the goal.  Because through that, you get the world of entertainment.  You get the web.  And if you can do it in a decent structure and put a business model behind it, then it's  not as if it's that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what's hard?  User interface is hard.  Yeah, exactly.  And Apple does it and is good at it.  Well, you look at that new nano and I mean, oh my God, that's gorgeous.  And then you have a huge stamp size screen.  They're the only people who could do it.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's two problems, Leo.  I think it's UI and it's the last inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the last inch is tough too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, the connection to the internet, to the TV is still elusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But let's say Google makes a box, roughly the same size, the same price.  It would be Logitech, I guess, is the manufacturer that you hook up by HDMI.  It's running Android.  You control it from an Android phone.  This is, by the way, it's not even the last inch, it's the last six feet because you got  the inch, which is the hockey puck to the TV.  It's how do you get to the hockey puck?  How do you control that?  Do you have to have an Android phone?  Well, that's not a very good solution.  What do you have, a wireless keyboard and mouse?  That's really an awful solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web TV time.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've been there before.  Maybe I'm wrong.  You don't want the browser.  No.  I just got a new Sony TV.  Remember I was speaking to Sony?  They didn't pay me.  I got a TV instead.  And it has the internet connection on it.  Yeah.  And my wife's not happy because we didn't need another TV.  We're going to pay taxes on it now.  But that's another story.  It's a great TV.  I'm happy.  So, 52 inches.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice.  Great picture.  And it has apps, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has ethernet and it has apps.  Yeah, it does.  But you know, I can't get us on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  The popcorn hour and the Yahoo TV.  Is Pandora on it?  Is Netflix on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix must be on it.  But the problem is that we're heading towards something far worse than Betamax.  The balkanization here.  That people start doing deals and you can get it on this box and not that box.  That's going to be killing for the explosion of TV.  And it's in the interests of both the cable companies and the TV networks for this to  stay balkanized as long as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at least the cable companies for sure.  If I'm a content creator, where I own a lot of content like the networks do, I'd love  to disintermediate the cable companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so at some point, but they also get a guaranteed monetization from those cable  companies.  They own cable channels that are subsidized ridiculously because we don't want them.  We have to pay for them.  Steven Levitan, the creator of Modern Family, has been out there rather troglodytish, complaining  about being on Hulu even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I love the show and I can't stand him for it.  I want to promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, he's old school.  Very.  Yeah.  He's been around the TV world a long time.  I wouldn't expect him to have that modern point of view even though the show is Modern  Family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My prediction for Google TV is that it's going to be kind of the nerd's choice of media.  It's going to be super hackable.  You're going to be able to install an app and get your BitTorrent feeds set up instantly  and you're going to be able to watch anything that's on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No advantage at all.  This is probably what happened.  Apple took a look, thought about it, said, there's no hurry.  We can continue on as we have.  Let's just slowly enter this market and do it right rather than rush and try to beat  Google at the game because Google isn't going to be a problem.  How is this right?  Well, it is iOS.  It is an A4.  They could remember the iPhone didn't come out with apps at first.  They could.  OK, all right.  Next year, they could.  The next month, they could have the firmware upgrade.  Great put more on it.  They probably I have a feeling that there was a little time pressure from Apple's point  of view because the deals weren't falling into place for content.  You know, they got Disney and barely got Fox through Rupert Murdoch.  It was apparently a tough negotiation.  So I think that they felt like, well, we don't have the deals in place.  There's no hurry.  Google's going to flop.  Google's going to fumble this.  We don't have to worry.  Roku is our competition.  Take your time.  That's probably what happened.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes sense.  Enough about Apple.  Who cares?  Apparently Google's got a big problem with a brain drain.  According to an article in TechCrunch, people are leaving Google for Facebook.  It's not the only company, by the way, losing people to Facebook.  I think this happens always in Silicon Valley.  There's an ebb and flow depending on whose stock is perceived as being more valuable.  Of course, Facebook's not public yet.  But if they're offering big options in an IPO down the road, that might be much more  valuable than the Google stock, which is already pretty high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The TechCrunch post gives the example of somebody who was offered a huge raise and  a $500,000 staying bonus and still left.  And still left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because Facebook has Zuckerbucks.  Those are valuable.  One million Zuckerbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the wood chips you can burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, baby.  Look at that.  Actually, he looks pretty good on the dollar bill.  That's what that Illuminati jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a story up there that Facebook is going to sell gift cards for virtual currency  at Target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At Target.  Not for anything real.  But Facebook bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buy this card with this made up currency to buy made up things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know how well that's going to do.  It's not Zynga dollars.  Facebook stopped selling the virtual goods.  So what is it that Facebook sells now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They used to have you could buy like a gift, a fake, an image of a gift basket for a buck  and a Gina, congratulations on your birthday.  And I give you an image and it cost me real money.  But I think they stopped doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I know that it cost you real money.  So it touches me even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Zuckerbucks that count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social games can be played by free.  So it is Zynga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zynga.  You can go to 7-Eleven, you know, and get Zynga dollars right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can now?  Brilliant.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They even have Farmville.  They have like a Farmville coffee cup.  They have all this crap.  Zynga is way ahead of Facebook on this one.  And you know what?  It pains me to admit it.  But I think that this is brilliant because think about OK, your mom, let's say your mom.  I know somebody whose mom plays Farmville all the time.  Not my mom, but another person whose mom plays Farmville all the time.  She would love a gift card says, look, you could buy a pony.  It costs me 10 bucks, makes her happy.  It's brilliant.  And the truth is, what is the production cost of a virtual pony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zero.  It's all profit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  This is a bigger scam than the state lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is.  This is the fall of the Roman Empire, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just think if we actually, I saw an article, I didn't put it in our feed, but there was  an article on Wired about how much time people actually spend in these virtual games.  And I think that one of the games, I think it's the one I play, We Rule, it's something  like 2.2 billion hours of farming.  If people actually farmed for 2.2 billion hours, we'd be in great shape.  If they did anything real for 2.2 billion hours, we'd have some real asset, you know,  a real surplus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I comfort myself with thoughts of Wikipedia and open source projects when I think about  that.  There's lots of ways to spend your time.  Some people do it gaming, which is just entertainment, and other people do it editing Wikipedia.  Gaming dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the point of play short keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I know, I think the cognitive surplus, we got to wonder a little bit.  Maybe there ain't such a cognitive surplus.  Clay says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a question of how we choose to use it.  Yes, we have the surplus, but we choose to use it buying fake cows.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What a world.  What a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Sue Gardner for Wikipedia, the chairman of the Wikipedia Foundation.  They just finished a year-long strategy effort, which is frightening to think of.  You've got a headache thinking about Wikipedians collaborating on strategy.  It seems to have worked pretty well.  A thousand Wikipedians, 26,000 pages, some very good ideas there.  They want to increase the diversity of people contributing in a place like the U.S.  They want to increase the reach in places like India.  It's really fascinating to see the value that's created.  The value of Facebook's been estimated at $5 billion.  They say that by calculating just the time put in editing, I've said this before in the  show, but never used the figure, now I can, that they ascribe a low per hour labor value  to the edits, and it adds up to $700 million a year of effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?  Isn't that amazing?  Just edits.  It's incredible.  That's Clay's point.  That's where the creativity and the cognitive surplus go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also saw Beth Novick, who's the head of the Obama Transparent Government Initiative,  and was talking about how you can harness that kind of effort for government.  Her example, which I liked, was that the social security site needs to be translated into  languages and probably needs to be translated into English too.  That's something that we could do out here.  We could use Wikipedia, wiki software, and we could just take these functions on and  do them.  You wonder, what does it need to make that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is kind of the government 2.0 special we did last Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need a community catalyst.  You need someone who's create that platform and then a good leader that kind of brings  people in and tracks people.  Right now, the open source software that I developed, ThinkUp, which the White House  Our community is just on fire.  The mailing list actually has been rocking today.  We're having this great discussion about it.  But so much has happened and so many people have contributed.  It's so cool to see folks just volunteer their time because they're interested and they want  to use this thing and they have great ideas.  When you put people with the same interests and smarts and experience in a room, it's  amazing what happens.  I've been doing this for years.  My whole career has been based on crowdsourcing.  Lifehacker was just me at the wheel with a bunch of people just pushing me with tips  and comments and links.  And so I mean, I've been doing this for a long time, but I'm still still amazed at the  magic that can happen when you get the right people together to collaborate.  So it's just a matter of creating that platform and then having the leader, having the Linus  Torvalds to kind of inspire people and to shepherd them along and give them the virtual  cookie and encouragement.  And I mean, all that the community management, I think, is the real skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we can accept that people are always going to waste time.  That's normal.  It's not the end of the world.  People have to have leisure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's great, Apple fanboys are saying we're doing that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's great that you can also put the same energies into something else.  Maybe both. Maybe you spend some time in Farmville and some time on an open source  project. And I think it's the same kind of thing.  The tools are there to get that done.  People are always going to waste time.  But they can. But there is an opportunity now to do this kind of thing.  And I think that's great.  The partner article to the article that we were just talking about about the brain  drain is from the San Francisco Chronicles website, the SFGate Facebook  working hard to avoid Google's fate.  Interesting idea.  The premise of which is that despite the fact that Google does very, very well, all  of its money, 95 percent of it comes off of search and search growth revenue is  revenue growth is very slowing.  And you're not going to have the kind of growth.  And by the way, the stock market loves growth and the multiples of growth.  They don't care if you're profitable.  You got to grow and grow fast, which is why Google stock price is starting to tank.  Why Google's losing talent to Facebook.  And so the ex-Googlers, according to this article, I should give credit to  Nicholas Carlson, actually, it's from the Business Insider, Gates republishing it.  So Nicholas Carlson, running the Business Insider, says the ex-Googlers running  Facebook, starting with COO Sheryl Sandberg, are determined to avoid turning  Facebook into a one trick pony, relying on a single revenue stream.  So among things that they're doing are search ads.  The like buttons give them a hierarchy of web pages, much like PageRank, but also  Facebook credits in games, which you could sell in Target.  Pay with Facebook on third party commerce sites, kind of a PayPal play.  Amazon's done that quite well.  Google's doing that really.  I see Google check out on a lot of sites.  Local coupons with the places feature.  It's kind of like Groupon, where you can have coupons that are tied to your location.  Brand advertising.  Of course, they're going to sell display ads.  By the way, those ads are still are doing quite well for, for Facebook.  And off Facebook brand advertising, because people use Facebook connect to log in.  You could tie in that way too, and make some money there too.  So interesting article.  It does make a lot of sense.  Facebook has a lot of ways to go.  Do you think Google's in trouble?  Do you think Google needs to, they certainly obviously looking for  additional revenue streams.  Is this the, when you, when you did your research for the book, what would Google  do, Jeff, was this thinking going on inside Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, you know, I don't really know.  Uh, the questions they asked me after the book came out were more about their PR,  but there was PR people, which I think is an issue.  Uh, it is an issue.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's true for both.  I, uh, you know, Eric Schmidt has said always, you know, we get 90 some  percent of our revenue from advertising.  We love advertising period.  But he also says that the board is pushing for more diversity of revenue  streams and they don't really have it.  I would never write them off.  I think that, uh, uh, their big strategy is mobile going forward and there's a  lot of growth to be had there.  The problem is that in each one of these new media, the revenue goes down, right?  Mobile's not a good advertising platform.  It'll be better.  It's much better with maps.  I mean, I'm using the voice control of maps and things like that.  And then I think there's a lot of potential there, but that's very hard to sell.  You need to scale that, which is hard and expensive.  So it's, there's growth there, but it's, it's hard growth.  I think the problem that Google has always said, Schmidt has said, this is  what I said, what's been said to me is the problem is the company becomes too  big and I think that wave and sorry, Gina, and, uh, and buzz and buzz.  And, uh, these efforts are the problem of size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you don't know where to, if it's, it's difficult, you want to have diversity  in a lot of ideas and try a lot of things out, but if you do that, it's hard to  throw all your weight behind it.  So a lot of these, and we see this happen with Google, uh, are, are tossed out,  tossed to the wind and with no support.  And they just wither away like wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I heard that the way that the wave team was structured, that wave was  wave was more like an acquisition than it was an internal product project.  I think that Lars and his team down in Sydney were kind of treated like a  separate startup, separate from the main company and that they had certain goals  to meet within like a year and they just didn't meet them.  This is kind of, this is kind of the background story a little bit.  It was like, and the understanding was if they didn't, you know, if they didn't  meet their goals, then they were, you know, they just weren't going to get the,  it just wasn't going to keep going.  So they didn't, I think, I think wave was structured a little differently,  especially just location.  You know, they were on the other side of the world and I definitely got a sense  that there was some disconnection with the rest of the company when I talked to  the wave team at IO.  So I think that was a special situation.  Uh, but, but, but I think this, you know, Android versus Chrome OS and, and Buzz  and a lot of other products that kind of started up and didn't go anywhere side  wiki, NOL, all these kinds of little things here and there that we all forgot  about do, uh, do indicate that there's definitely fracturing fragment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they damage Google a little bit because you don't, uh, you know, you don't  get the network effect.  You don't get people jumping on board unless you feel, if Google doesn't Google  me, and I have to say this as a Google fan boy, at this point, I'm going to  stand back and watch a lot of people feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the irony is that, that they were the brilliant ones at the beta and at  labs and they got, I don't know what it is.  They just got cocky or something and it changed the structure so that, no, we  have to release, you know, buzz as a done product without the beta.  If you, if Google just said, Hey, we're trying some stuff out.  It may work.  It may not.  We all get that.  Right.  And things don't make it out of labs.  Okay.  But Google, I think does hurt themselves when they say we're behind  this and they're not, and you listen to, you know, dodgeball, uh, Dennis Crowley.  It was obviously an unpleasant experience.  He had the same across the world problem.  He was in New York.  Yep.  Uh, they could have had four square.  They could have had a real jump on Facebook and a real jump on Apple and local.  And they blew it.  That's, that's to me, one of the worst mistakes they've made.  Uh, they obviously don't know how to acquire companies.  If, if Gina, I think you've got a point about that.  And I think these two are parallel stories then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, uh, one monetization path, YouTube may be starting pay-per-view movies.  This rumor from financial times says that Google will launch the service  first in the United States, but is in talks with studios, uh, worldwide.  It's kind of what Apple's doing, isn't it?  With their new iTunes streaming store.  Um, but you, but you know, Steve, it was interesting in Steve's speech today.  There were a couple of shots at Google shot.  Uh, one early on was Steve said, well, somebody's mentioning how many  activations they have a day.  Did you know we have 230,000 activations a day and that doesn't include upgrades,  which those other guys are counting and we have no idea of, you know, where  these numbers come from or anything, but he was very clear that we're growing  faster than Android if you include all iOS devices, that was clearly a shot at  Google and he mentioned YouTube several times as being, you know, a, a, a  cheesy, you know, he did say we've got YouTube on the Apple TV, but he, but  earlier he said people want Hollywood content.  They want amateur hour.  They don't want amateur hour was the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, amateur hour.  I wonder if he's ever watched some of the great web video that goes on.  Like, I wonder if he's ever watched the gilfiler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That pisses me off because, because he's the one who enabled amateur hour.  It's his tools that we use to make this amateur crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's our fault that we make it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good point.  That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, he did the same thing with podcasting.  He really deprecated podcasting before Apple put a podcasting into iTunes.  He, he said basically the same thing.  It was amateur hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amateur hour was definitely the most offensive thing that that was.  And that's aimed at YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big stuff, Steve.  He wouldn't be selling final cut.  You'd be selling a lot fewer copies of it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so Google, I know I do too.  I like that face.  He makes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't even had any cabernet yet.  You just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think we are, we, I mean, we're, we're continue with this Apple versus Google  thing.  Steve did, was not as aggressive about it as Google was at Google IO.  But it's clear that they're still see each other as, you know, bunning heads over  some things.  And this, this YouTube as a streaming, paid service is an interesting play against  Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Facebook going to enter this phrase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  They could write.  Yeah.  Of all, I'll tell you, of all the people who know how to scale Facebook seems the  best at this.  They, they, I, it's unbelievable.  The amount of traffic they serve with, with relatively few slowdowns or hiccups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, was it your point, somebody, somebody made a smart point.  And of course I assume all smart points are from one of you that I heard recently  that the reason that Facebook, that the, that one of the great keys to the Facebook's  growth and success was that it could meter its scaling because it first was only  Harvard only, only Ivy league, only college.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't me, but you're absolutely right.  Yep.  Yep.  And so they were able to scale bit by bit.  And by the way, create a, it had a secondary benefit created demand because,  Oh, I want to get in there.  It's very exclusive.  If you go from the exclusive, more exclusive to less exclusive, you create  demand all along the way.  It's too late now.  Everybody's got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Gmail did that right.  What they were invited for a long time.  Very smart.  Yeah.  The point about having all these, all these products, kind of throwing stuff  up against the wall and see what sticks.  And we have to remember that Gmail was a 20% project, right?  So with every 20% project, there's a possibility that it'll become Gmail, right.  Which is such a successful product.  So successful that they keep adding stuff to it.  Right.  So, you know, that's how you can kind of understand it a little bit, but you know,  for every one success, you know, you're going to have nine failures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  No, I think you're very, very right.  I think that, but, but isn't there a bit of a difference though, in the way that  they launched Gmail, Oh, let's see what we think of this.  It's a beta.  We'll, we'll not let you in, you know, we're trying this out versus how  they launched Wave and Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Gmail was way more finished when it, when it launched, even an invitation  only beta than, than Wave.  Also Gmail was obvious what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  It was more finished yet more humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Same perfect combination.  Yeah.  Finished and humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Versus unfinished and overweening.  And I think you'd have to say that about Wave when you say we're going to  replace email and then people try.  That's a big mistake marketing wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They aim too high.  That was Wave's problem.  They, they, they just aim too high, too high, too, too much, too fast with  nothing that actually, you know, that didn't work the way it needed to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I have to say one thing that this whole conversation encourages me is  this stuff is really hard and, and, and that's good because it means no one  company, not Microsoft, not IBM, not Apple, not Google can just march in and  say, or Facebook can march in and say, we got it, we'll take it from here  and dominate forever.  They can do it for a while, but this stuff is really hard.  And at some point, somebody smarter and faster and better and it's going to  come along and you're going to have to step aside.  What's happening is it happening faster and faster.  I tell you if three years ago, uh, it didn't, it seemed like, well, Google,  there's no way anybody could ever beat Google because they have the index.  Uh, you know, and it's true.  Nobody could beat them at search.  It's just that search isn't the end game.  There is no end game.  There's the next thing and the next thing and the next.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, are you using the Facebook places guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am.  I had to re up.  Yeah, I know.  Embarrassingly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, that's like me buying an iPad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, my wife won't let me.  One of my students in my entrepreneurial journalism class has a business coming  based on the iPad and so I tried the trial balloon and say, well, you know,  I've been waiting for the thing that makes me have to eat crow and get it.  She said, you are not getting it again.  Yeah.  Waste that money on the read stocking fee.  You are not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Jeff and I did the thing, the YouTube, I give up on this thing, which  is always a mistake because it never goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so, yeah, no, I had, I actually was places that got me back on Facebook  because I really needed to understand the privacy implications.  I had a dummy account that I'd created last month just to see what the  default privacy settings were.  And then I, then I realized that I can't do places unless I have friends  because I have to see what the check-ins look like.  I have to see how people check me.  And so yeah, I'm basically back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, are you, are you a leader of four square fan?  Are you using the places?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm, I'm not using Facebook places.  I don't trust Facebook enough to, with my location data.  I am still using four square.  And I really, I really like it.  And there's just something about four square.  You know, I know it's this kind of plucky New York company and, you know, I don't  know, I have this like trust in them because I just think that they're, they're good at it.  But now I have an, I disabled it day one.  I was like, I'm turning this off right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I, if you check in with four square or scavenger or a lot of other  places, you could tie it to Facebook.  So it doesn't really matter.  You can still check in if you choose.  This is the interesting thing about places.  So here I'm checking into Twit Cottage, but these are other people at Twit  Cottage who are Facebook friends of mine.  I can add them to the check-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, uh, you know, I could tag the friends who are with me and check them in.  Now they have to set a privacy setting that says you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, and you have to set that, right?  That's not the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is the other thing with Facebook.  It's not clear what the default is.  But I could, I could check all these people.  Anybody who want to in, uh, anytime, but I will, I will check in the people that,  uh, that I know are here.  My CEO, Lisa Kintzel and, um, Tom Merritt.  I know he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good thing is they work for you.  So what are they going to say?  Yeah, they can't stop me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Try and complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, and actually I should uncheck Darren kitchen.  He's not here today.  And then, uh, when I'm done, it's, it's now going to check me in with those two  people.  And if they haven't said anything about it, I've just, I've just announced to  the world that they're here.  Which is kind of, uh, that's kind of an interesting, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or what it's worth.  I don't use Google latitude either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, latitude's worse latitude.  You know, if you look at my, um, my Google chat, uh, status message, it's got  my exact location all the time as I travel around, people always know where I  am.  So, and that's kind of the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't really get anything back.  And Zuckerberg said to me that the problem with latitude is you don't get  anything back for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, come on, what do I get back for four square places?  I get, you know, if I check into my health club, it's, it says you get a free  three day guest pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  But what will your daughter get when it comes to a college and seeing friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there, there you go.  No, you're absolutely right.  And latitude does this.  I can go to maps and I can see who's nearby on latitude.  If they're my latitude friend.  So you get that from latitude.  In fact, it kind of a nice way.  Everybody's got Google maps.  It's kind of cool if you turn on the latitude background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you get who's near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get who's near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I haven't seen that.  All right.  That's kind of nice.  Yeah.  Which Facebook oddly doesn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So yeah, the coupons and so forth, you don't get from latitude, but you, but  you get the location information.  By the way.  Yes.  I can make latitude citywide, which I do.  I don't, I don't tell you my home address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, what happened to buzz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel bad because I really liked buzz and I liked the buzz team and  they're very cooperative, but I'm scared.  I got bit by buzz.  So if this happened during twit on Sunday, it was very weird.  I had buzz connected to dig.  Kevin Rose was sitting across from me when this happened.  I had buzz connected to dig so that, you know, the new dig.  And by the way, this turns out to be one of the things people at dig.  Hey, the diggers hate the new dig lets publishers pump feeds in there.  So Mashable pumps every story just as they do by the way, it buzz.  I, uh, when Kevin asked me to be part of the beta, uh, they said,  what feeds you want to pump in?  I said, well, I'll put in the, all the Twitch shows, my buzz feed and my delicious  feed.  And then now that it went public, people said, Leo spamming us with all these links.  So I, I took it.  I took everything off and just delicious, but for a while, everything I buzzed was  pumped into dig as a Doug item.  Uh, but it was one way.  Sunday now dig four has all sorts of bugs and problems.  They put a new whole new system up and it's really messy.  Um, and breaks a lot and so forth.  And somehow Sunday it's my dig RSS feed changed from stuff that I've dug to  everything on the front page, hundreds of stories I'd never even seen about Paris  Hilton and all sorts of crap.  Nothing that I ever dug or saw or anything.  And, and this is what I think had to have been a Google buzz bug established a  established a reverse direction connection into buzz.  Oh, so suddenly hundreds of stories that I had nothing to do with from the front  page of goop dig or pumped into buzz.  And I have buzz can tweet turned on.  So then from buzz, it pumped into anybody who saw my Twitter feed and I'm all of a  sudden getting these tweets like it was a meltdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, this is a total meltdown.  I don't know how I missed this.  I guess I wasn't on Twitter this weekend.  Did you clean out your Twitter feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So what happened is I get started, I'm on the air doing Twitter.  So I couldn't have done this by, by the way, I have, I have an alibi.  Uh, and Kevin's sitting right there.  So I said, okay, well, and, uh, so I went into buzz and I, I immediately turned off.  I said, well, how did dig get pumped and become my connected site.  So I turned that off.  It turned it back and saved it and turned it back on again.  So buzz, something there's a bug in buzz that allowed a third party to change the  settings that I had given buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big bug.  That's a big bug.  Did you talk to buzz, the buzz folks about that?  No, I just quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause it was the second big bug in literally three days.  Yeah.  And it's like, okay, I'll wait till you figure this out.  Cause I don't really need buzz.  And so I went on Twitter.  I said, I'm really sorry.  I don't know what happened.  I deleted all those messages.  I, I went to buzz.  Now, if you go to buzz and you say disconnect buzz, it says, warning, you're  going to delete your Google profile, your Google account and all your buzzes.  So, no, no, I don't want to do that.  I mean, they really scared me.  They said, oh, you really want to delete your Google account?  So you have to go in and there's a different setting, which says, oh, just,  uh, I don't want to see buzz in my Gmail.  And then I went into buzz manually and took out all the connections.  So there's nothing coming into buzz.  I also went to dig, took out all the connections there.  I mean, I, I, I mean, this was a mess.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is fascinating because it is the danger.  One hand, I want these things to connect, right?  I want my Apple social and my Facebook social and my four square social to  connect, but this is the nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, I look, I don't like auto publishing, but it just made sense that  buzz should go to Twitter.  If I'm going to spend all my time in buzz, that it should go to Twitter so  that people can see what I'm talking about.  And it made sense briefly for buzz to go into dig.  I did realize that's really not the, the, the aesthetic of dig.  Dig is kind of you curate.  So I do have delicious going to dig.  Cause those are articles that I pick.  So there would be articles I would dig, except I don't want to both delicious and  dig and that's, that's why you connect accounts, right?  Same kind of content, but you don't want to have to do it twice.  So it seems like that's okay to me.  I'm look, I'm not gone from buzz forever.  If they figure this out, they figure it out, but I, you know what the side  effect of this is, and I have to think other people have the same reaction is  I'm going to be very suspicious of a Google me because jeez, I don't want  to have that happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So between the privacy issues, they had the beginning of buzz, the buzz deleted  me bug that happened to me and now the buzz making connections to third party  sites I didn't approve of.  Do you blame me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's understandable.  It's understandable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I feel people say you're such a drama queen, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I am.  Except that broadcasting is your business.  Yeah.  And these are the tools that you're using to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, I, I was watching my Twitter follower count.  You physically go down.  Yeah.  I lost hundreds and hundreds of followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were Comcast or Best Buy and this happened, you'd suffer real economic damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I certainly suffered reputation damage.  I, I can't tell you how many tweets I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're nice and cuddly.  People like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people went from liking me to not liking me.  That's, that's really what hurt.  I got a lot of tweets saying, Leo, you jerk, you're spamming us.  What an idiot.  I get, I got a lot of attoperation and that actually was what finally did it.  Cause I, I don't like people not like me.  That hurts my feelings.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to be more like Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it goes with the game.  Of course, I get hate mail every day.  It's not that you're not going to get hate mail, but I just didn't want it.  It wasn't something I did.  I don't mind getting hate mail for things I do, but in this case, I was, I had no  control over it.  I was a victim.  So anyway, that's what that's all about.  And I apologize to members of the Buzz team because they've been very nice.  I like them and I like Buzz.  I, I wish there were something I could use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were the greatest booster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you make me feel terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, don't Leo, don't feel bad.  I completely understand now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The time it was, it felt bad.  That's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And like the whole read, write thing where like something's writing back to  something that shouldn't happen.  That's not scary stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if that could happen, I mean, you know, if what if it discovered my  porn accounts, I'm in deep trouble.  So Google bought social deck and this is a company from Canada, Waterloo, Ontario.  Um, that is the maker of social games for mobile phones.  They've bought, they're doing, they're on an acquisition tear.  Aren't they?  Um, they bought, uh, they got this company.  Was it angst, angst row that, uh, it looks like they really were trying  to get the guy behind angst row.  Um, do you know what I'm talking about?  Am I, uh, find that article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, there was another article in there about their, their new focus on, on,  um, acquisitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what does it, can we put this together, uh, and, and make some sort  of coherent narrative, uh, around this?  Are they, is this all about building Google me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this their way to do social social games?  I can't imagine that Google's not exactly a game brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always a different difficult because, um, you don't know if they're  buying the brains and not the intellectual property.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Angst row on the 30th.  So that was a couple of days ago and social deck.  I thought word was that social deck was about social gaming for their mobile.  So like being able to game via the Android, do what Apple's doing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their own game center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought that was one of the articles that we linked in the front feed.  That is, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then, and then angst row.  Um, let me, I did find the article.  Uh, angst row is, uh, it looks very much like a Google me.  Um, it's a, it's a, um, uh, Dr.  Rohit car, a software engineer with two decades of technical and  standards experience at MCI, the worldwide web consortium.  Uh, um, no now commerce net.  Um, and it was, it was actually Yahoo's in-house incubator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, this may be about the talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was certainly a talent by, um, in fact, he wrote an article.  He wrote an article in December that's called for a tech crunch called privacy  theater, why social networks only pretend to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, that sounds very salacious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're, they're clearly building a brain trust of something.  Now, maybe it's just, you know, and they got max, uh, left-hand from slide.  Yep.  Um, I have to think this is all around Google me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So paid content had a piece in which they quote the analysts on deep, uh,  agarwal saying that the purchases are more defensive and they will chart  their right, which ones are, are offensive and defensive.  And, um, arguing that they're aiming and not only increasing their own revenue,  but hurting competitors.  That's why it's that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you've got a brain drain and there's a brain out there, you get it.  You don't waste time, uh, letting brains go.  Well, the big Google story, and we're going to get to it in just a moment,  of course, and, uh, and we're glad to know that Gina actually has this  is the new priority inbox.  And we're so mad at you, Gina, that you have it.  I finally just got the voice chat, the, you know, the, the phone  calls inside the Google chat.  So we'll talk about priority inbox in just a second before we do though.  I want to mention our friends at Citrix who do go to meeting the  best way to meet online, go to meeting, uh, builds on that great Citrix  backbone of remote access to let you hold meetings anywhere in the  world with up to 15 attendees.  Uh, you can show them what's on your computer.  They can take control, show you what's on their computer.  It is both a time saver and a meeting galvanizer.  I mean, after all, let's face it, conference calls, which are really  pretty much how people do these things are boring and it's very difficult  to keep them on track, keep them productive.  As soon as you've got visuals, which you have with go to meeting,  everybody's on the same page.  They could see your screen.  They follow along with you.  They're more focused, more interested, more engaged, and that  means you're more productive.  You save time.  There's even an iPad app, which I think is so fantastic for sales  presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaboration, weekly  update calls, just about any kind of conference call you're making now.  It'd be so much as imagine how much better it would be with go to meeting.  Well, you don't have to imagine you could try it free right now for 30 days,  30 days, unlimited meetings, as many meetings as you want, as long as you  want, go to go to meeting.com slash twig.  That's all you have to do.  And you can sign up for 30 days.  Absolutely free.  I think you're going to like it though.  So I should warn you, don't try this unless you're willing to buy it.  Cause you are going to get hooked.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  We thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in Google.  So Google has been busy with the rollouts.  I, you know, first this free phones.  I think we talked about that last week.  Yep.  And finally I got it.  Jeff, do you have it yet?  The free phone?  Not on my apps account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have it only on my regular Gmail account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You won't get it in your apps account, right?  Jeannette?  Oh, I won't.  No.  No, you will actually.  I do have it.  You have it in your apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have it in my apps account.  There is a setting in your apps account, Jeff.  I think I tweeted it.  You have to opt in to pre-release features early.  So if you check that box and say, I want, I want new stuff early, then  you'll get stuff faster.  I don't know what the overall schedule for the Google apps rollout, but I  definitely have call phone in my, in my apps account right now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause initially they said that we're not going to, it's not enterprise ready.  We're not going to put it in apps.  So that's good.  You just have to say, I, I don't, I know it's not enterprise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have any idea where you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of buried in this.  You have to go into manage this domain and, uh, let's see if I can find this.  It's kind of buried in one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I don't mean to take everybody's time with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I bet you there are people out there who didn't know this.  I didn't know what I'm about to do it myself.  I want to, I want to, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh, so we got to manage this domain and then it's, uh, I  believe it's domain settings.  And then if you scroll down, it says automatically add new services  and then become available.  Check that box.  And then there's a checkbox that reads enable pre-release features.  Certain features launched to consumer users are held back by default from  Google apps until they're more mature.  If you select this object option, these pre-release features will  be enabled for your users.  So check that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How the heck did you find that Gina?  She's good.  She's good.  You should get the Chilean miners out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of buried.  It is kind of buried, but listen, I am deeply interested in getting my  Gmail features in my default account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Does, do you get buzzed that way too?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, buzz is not in apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  It is not an app.  So, um, and I've tried it and you know, the quality is very good.  Uh, it's free cost anywhere in the U S and Canada, they say at least  through the end of the year, my prediction is they'll keep doing that forever.  I don't see why they, I mean, it probably doesn't cost them very much.  And it's certainly a great way to get people to start using Gmail.  Yeah.  And Google chat.  Um, so now priority inbox and, uh, I wish there were a button I could  push to make that happen because I'm excited about it, Gina, would you  describe what this thing does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a really cool feature.  When you turn on priority inbox, you get a new inbox in the call  priority inbox in the left sidebar.  Priority inbox, uh, looks at your email activity, the people who you  email and chat with the most, and then makes decisions about, uh, what  are the more important emails?  So, you know, if Leo emails me, it's going to automatically get marked as  important and goes into priority inbox.  So it introduces these two kind of new, uh, labels, not important and important  and important stuff goes into priority inbox.  So it's like the spam filter, except the opposite, you know, it bubbles  up the emails that are most important.  So you can mark, you can train it too.  So in fact, just now I'm looking at my priority inbox and I had a  message from meetup that's not important.  Right?  So I, you know, check that and said, not important.  And then from there on in, it'll know not to put, you know, meetup  emails in my priority inbox.  I really liked this a lot because it really lets you look at your inbox.  And instead of it just being reversed chronological, you can see here's  email from people who I communicate with, which is obviously going to be something,  you know, that's important.  And here's the rest of the, you know, the bacon as they call it, instead of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How well does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works pretty well.  Mine's definitely needed some training.  So I got it yesterday morning and I've been kind of training  things, training it as it goes.  It's very satisfying by the way, to mark messages as not important, especially  for people you don't like very much.  You are not important.  Not important.  And then, you know, marking things as important.  So I'm hoping that if the learning mechanism is good, it's going to be really good.  What strikes me about priority inbox is that this is a really good reason to check  your Gmail in the web browser, right?  Because these are special labels.  They don't show up in your client or on your phone.  Not yet.  Anyway, I'm hoping today.  But this is a really good play.  Like this is Google saying the web browser is the best place to check your Gmail.  And I got to tell you, it really, really is.  So I'm digging it.  I still, you know, to just still out.  It's only been two days, but I've been busy kind of training, marking things as important  and not important.  And so far I've been really liking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't wait to get it.  Is there any way to force it?  Not button you can press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I know of.  Yell at the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If 50 was being debuzed, just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This, this feature is actually really similar to multiple inboxes, which is a  Gmail Labs feature, which just adds a few different lists of messages into your,  like a few different inboxes.  And then you configure each one.  You say, I want all my starred messages that are on red to appear here.  So this is just kind of like helping, helping it along, but just imagine it as a  spam filter, but the other way around an important filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's so, it's kind of the same technology, I guess, in a way.  I mean, if you know what spam is and you know, what's not spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, I, yeah, I mean, I would imagine.  And I think that it probably works really well for folks who use Gmail.  You know, don't just forward.  Like I think that Gmail needs to know who you actually email, you know, you sent,  you know, I think it looks at your sent mail and your, and your chat logs to  determine that important.  So I don't know if I don't know how well it'll work for you, Leo.  I'll be interested to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I can't wait to try it.  I, you know, I don't get most of my mail in Gmail, so it's not a great test.  I wish I'm starting to think, you know, we've, we've finally got to move the  corporate email to Google apps and I'm starting to think maybe I should get off  fast mail, which is it's pretty great Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is pretty great.  I'd be interested to see if it was enough for you, Leo, cause I'm sure that  you do stuff with your email that none of us even want to imagine in our worst moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you mostly, I use fast mail supports a scripting language called  Civ that I use for some pretty heavy.  It's some crazy filters.  Yeah.  It's more than just filters.  It's, it's all sorts of processing.  You can do things like, well, if it's, if it's got more than three CCs and my  name is repeated more than once, but it comes from one of my, you can do  all sorts of if clauses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really nice.  The algorithm is writing those formulae.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I do more than just spam.  I mean, I am doing all sorts of folder filtering and things like that.  I can, you know, I, it's, it would be a good experiment.  I think it would be interesting.  It's a little nerve wracking, but I might, I might well try it.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, this, this approaches, uh, last summer, I got in trouble for saying  this too often, but I haven't said it in months.  Uh, this approaches Marissa Meyers hyper personal news stream.  And if Google can watch what you read an email and then I can also watch other  things you do, that's that should have been buzz.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, uh, what you search for and other things, it can prioritize a lot of life.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And save me time.  And scary as that sounds, it saves you time in the end.  If I, if I answered email from someone who I'd want to get back to quickly,  you know, that otherwise would have just flowed down into my inbox.  You know, it's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's really, uh, the first time in years we've seen a new slot,  a new take on email.  I mean, you know, email is pretty basic.  Yeah.  Wave aside.  It's a pretty basic functionality and, um, uh, this is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's huge.  It is.  And Google has the technology to do this.  Right.  I mean, if they have all your activity and they have these, you know, sort of  awesome engines to classify spam and to, and to rank search results.  I mean, if it's as good as it's search results, then you know, it's, it's going  to, it's a really good, it's a really good feature.  And again, it's going to get people back into the web browser with Gmail.  I don't think that people, I think that most people do love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I imagine that it will soon be in the cultural argument.  Uh, what you just said a bit ago, uh, Hey, Hey, lay off or I'm going to not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  important you, you're not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  My Gmail mark is not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did it make a mistake?  Oh, I got caught in my spam filter.  It would be the new caught in my spam filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I can't wait to get it.  It sounds like a really interesting update.  Yeah.  All right.  Let us, uh, I think go to our, uh, wrap this thing up with our, uh, our.  Tool number and tip of the week, starting with Gina Trapani from  smarterware.org and her tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My tool of the week or my tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a tool.  You're a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one's for aspirational programmers.  I get people asking me all the time, like, you know, I want to learn how to  code and I don't know where to start.  I think probably most of the people that listen to the show are pretty savvy and  have kind of probably played with code a little bit at least, but, and this,  this was new to me, I'm not sure how long it's been around, but it was due to me.  Google code university.  Uh, if you go to a code.google.com slash edu.  It's got all these free courses on kind of like googly languages.  And when I say googly languages, I mean like Python, Java, go, uh, HTML  five, C plus plus, and it's a bunch of like free courses and they're geared  toward relative beginners.  So if you're, you know, an auto didactic type that can kind of pick up a book and  learn something, there's some good, some good syllabus, syllabi, excuse me here.  My Latin teacher would smack me syllabi, uh, here and some good, um, tutorials to  work through, get you, get it, get you to that hello world.  And some of them are Google friendly languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems a little spotty in terms of its coverage.  I mean, you're not going to get thorough coverage, you know, then gender Java.  It's got the Java memory model and effective static race detection.  But, but if you're interested in effective static race detection, you are set, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you click on like Android and the, and the, and the, and the  sidebar under courses, if you click on Android, there's some Android  application development and that's, that's Java or Python.  Uh, and if, you know, there's web programming, so you have some Ajax  and this is great.  Oh, this is, yeah, there's some good, uh, there's some good stuff here.  It's not all hosted at Google.  Some of it is, um, hosted.  This is Cal Poly for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And here's one from North Carolina state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So HTML five rocks.com.  This is great.  Yeah.  So it's a good resource for folks who are just interested in, uh, maybe  working through a tutorial or two and getting, getting there, their programming

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chops, the CPE CSC four Oh nine special topics on software engineering at Cal  Poly.  I love it that universities are starting to put this stuff online.  I think that's just, I mean, amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh good.  By the way, I can't remember.  Did both of you get into the app inventor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you did.  I didn't.  You did the hello world.  Gina, you didn't.  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, um, that was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got in last week.  Oh, okay.  I think they're just going out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you hello world yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No tech crunch got it like right away, but we, we little minions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.  The shine was gone for Leo.  He's like, whatever.  Hello.  This.  I hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hello.  Right here.  No, I'm going to do, I just haven't gotten around to it, but see, I'm, I'm also  playing with, with, with real Android development, but it's so, I don't know.  Uh, if I want to kind of start doing something that's that simple, but it's, it's  a great idea for Google to do that.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Your number of the week.  Well, by the way, we should just repeat that sites.google.  I'm sorry.  Code.google.com slash edu for the Google university.  Your number of the week, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  J I'll try to, uh, trender says that during the Apple announcement, there were as  many as 6,000 tweets a minute.  Wow.  Topic of various, um, uh, topics.  And then the other one I love is I just got this today that 61% of Iceland is on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  61% of Iceland, I'm surprised it's not more actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's that or fishing, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no.  Let me tell you those Icelanders, when the sun comes out, the clothes go off.  They're very, um, they like to, um, make hay while the sun shines.  So I'm not surprised they're actually fairly active on Facebook.  They're hooking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All they can make plans from them when sun comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you get long winners, the hookups become so important.  I have a couple of tools.  There's a fellow in the chat room been asking over and over again.  I realize that we haven't talked much about it.  You know, if you do get to Froyo and a lot of people are in Froyo now, the  incredible just got Froyo, Droid, Droid two have Froyo, you know, uh, Android  operating system, 2.2 the way task killers work has changed.  And in fact, I think it was Google's intent that you not need a task killer  in 2.2, that it should just work automatically.  And they certainly put a lot of, uh, underpinnings under there to make, you  know, programs that are done, go away, uh, not use up resources and so forth.  It does, you know, occasionally happen, but yeah, most of the task killers no  longer, it's not that they crash or maybe, you know, don't apparently work,  but they really aren't doing anything.  Uh, what I, what I've done is I've switched from a task killer and I  mentioned this before, but, but this would be a timely time to re re mention  it to something called watchdog, which, uh, is, is probably better for Froyo use.  What it does is it monitors CPU usage.  So I have a little widget, the watchdog widget here, but I'll launch a watchdog  and, uh, and what it's doing is it's, it will warn you, it'll actually give you  an alert and you have a variety of ways of, uh, having that receiving that alert.  If somebody starts to hog the CPU and, uh, you can get that, you see, I got an  alert from a click set application that it was up to 80% CPU usage.  You can set the threshold and then this is like top Gina or anybody who's  used a, a Unix command line.  Basically you're going to get top here, which will show, um, CPU usage,  memory usage and so forth.  And you can individually kill runaway apps, which is probably all you need to do.  And the creator of watchdog, uh, the reason I know this has written a fairly  long explanation of why task killers don't work as well in under 2.2 and why  you might want to use a program like this.  This actually is a great program.  It's called watchdog.  I think it's a buck, two bucks in the, uh, in the store, but here's my,  here's my free pick.  This is my actual tool.  No, it's not Facebook.  It's this very cool.  It's called awesome drop.  Now I've just launched awesome drop and it says, get your pin at labs.dashwire.com.  So let me just quickly type in labs.dashwire.com.  This does require, I think 2.0 or later.  And when I go to labs.dashwire.com, there's a pin.  You might say, well, what the heck is that all about?  Well, I'm going to enter that pin now into my Android device.  This is a droid X it's connecting.  Now it's connected to what?  To my browser and this browser, I can drag and drop files from  my desktop to the browser.  Let me just, let me get a file here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I drag it here.  It starts copying it to my phone and there it is picture one dot PNG.  And I can view it in the Astro.  That was just copied over from this picture just copied over by  drag and drop from there.  Is that slick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Cause you always forget your freaking USB cable, right?  Yeah, I don't need it.  And you don't want to email it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes over 3G or, or, you know, you don't even have to be on the same  network for this to work.  It will go, it goes over the, over the internet.  Now it's using the HTML five drag and drop feature.  So you ha you really pretty much have to use it with Chrome.  I guess it might work with, with a Safari, but, uh, Hey, who doesn't use Chrome here?  So that is a, that is a really slick program.  It's called awesome drop.  It's absolutely free.  It's on the marketplace.  If you want to get it, a W E S O M E drop D R O P by dash wire.  And, uh, I think that's a, that's a pretty darn, uh, slick demonstration of what  HTML five can do drag and drop to your browser and then to your phone works over  wifi and 3G and as you see it, it works fast and it's easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very cool.  We should mention that arcade fire thing.  Speaking of, uh, should we do it real quickly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell me about, tell me about this.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Chrome experiment.  It's basically, it's an arcade fire song and music video, but like in your browser,  it pops all kinds of different windows and it's customized.  So the whole concept of the video is that someone's running to your child at home.  It's kind of going, remembering your childhood, if I understand this correctly.  So when you go to the site, it asks you for the address of the place where you grew up,  which is kind of a personal question to be asked by a website.  You don't really know, but if you do it, make up an address and then you hit go and  it creates this really cool music video with like, and do the, do the, do the  It pops up all different, um, windows with like really neat animations and video.  And it's somebody kind of running through the streets using Google maps, uh, going to  your address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't even the font is animated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't touch the windows though.  Cause the first time I ran this, I started to rearrange the windows.  You know how you just jump in there and say, wait a minute, that's wrong.  And that screws it up.  So don't, don't mess with the windows.  Uh, let it do it.  Now there's one error here.  If you, if you ask me, I can't believe HTML five doesn't allow you to get rid of  the title bar and the URL window on a window, but it's crazy.  But maybe JavaScript will do that.  So maybe they decided to leave that in, but you see, it's going to pop up new browse.  It's like when you go to one of those porn storm sites.  I second time I've mentioned porn on this show.  Really?  I'm not a sick pervert purely for research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's that little window at the bottom, uh, right-hand corner where you  can pause and mute it.  So you've actually, I mean, it's kind of a new way to do video and multi windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  And it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's playing the arcade fire song now, but in a little bit, it'll start pulling up  images.  I put Petaluma in as my hometown.  You'll put, pull up street view images and, uh, that will tie into the lyrics of  the song.  There it is.  There's Petaluma and you see the birds flying across and you even see a dot where  the guy is running.  So it's kind of an interesting, yeah, it's kind of an interesting, uh, use of HTML  five.  It's an experiment.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's eye candy, but it's fun.  I can pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is eye candy.  We know that absolutely from smarterware.org.  She's also a writing and working for fast company.com.  You can see her new, uh, her new series on fast company.  It's fast company.com slash work smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Work smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Work smart.  Yep.  No.  Er.  And, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leah will be in video in upcoming week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  You'll see me someday soon.  Jeff Jarvis is the author of what would Google do?  He also blogs at buzz machine.com and is a, uh, professor of journalism at the city  university of New York.  You were looking for, I saw a tweet.  You said you had, but you were looking for another grad student or what was that all  about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I teach entrepreneurial journalism and if there's someone in New York, especially  unemployed journalists, but others, uh, I have a little bit of space in the class.  Oh, neat.  So email, go to my blog, buzz machine.com and see the description of the course.  And I'll accept a few people based on kind of the mix of the course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  I've never heard of a professor advertising on Twitter.  That's a first.  Of course it would be Jeff that would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is professor 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
