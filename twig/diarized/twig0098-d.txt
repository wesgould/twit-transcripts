Trippant.  Right?  You got it.  Gina Trippant from smarterwear.org.  But you can call her Gina.  I can't get the Trippant right.  Gina Trippant is here.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay.  Pani is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, we're trying to figure out how we can get Gina on Twitter on Sunday because she's going to be very close to here for Tim O'Reilly's food camp at the O'Reilly headquarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will make that happen.  I would love to get you there.  I need to see the cottage before the new.  You know what we should do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should have a werewolf tournament.  Oh.  And then should I succeed in fooling you about my werewolf heritage?  I'm going to accuse you instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not going to work.  Well, then you're going to accuse me back and then it's just a matter of who believes who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's mutually assured destruction.  It's a game, folks.  It's a geek game.  They play at these kinds of things.  No.  Really?  No, I think there's probably people who say, what are you talking about?  Don't you think that's Jeff Jarvis right there?  He knows he's never been to food, but he has been to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm afraid I won't get invited again.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we're going to tell everybody, please.  We want Jeff to come to food camp.  So please invite.  You know, you can't lobby for this.  There's no way that that then you don't get invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's catch 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you have to ask.  No.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine to come.  He is also on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis and he is the author of What Would Google Do?  And better bookstores everywhere.  Also joining us right now, Adam Pash from likefacker.com.  He's the tip guy.  I don't know why I have trouble saying life hacker.  Life hacker.  Yeah, you should be used to it by now.  Dot com.  Great to have you back, Adam.  Yeah, thanks for having me back.  It's an happy IPv6 day, everybody.  Yes.  Gina, you're the geeky in the crowd, the programmer.  What the hell is IPv6 day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wasn't prepared for this at all.  Uh oh.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you in my cracked way and then you can correct me.  OK.  So we ran out of Internet addresses.  Who to thunk it?  Because the current system, IP version four.  You know, it's TCP, IP, the Internet protocol, the current version, the Internet protocol,  version four, only allows for, well, it's a dotted quad.  So it's eight bits by eight bits by eight bits by eight bits.  It's four bytes, which I think is what?  Four billion, no, two billion addresses.  Four billion addresses.  Anyway, we ran out, we're running out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Running out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  In fact, in some areas they have run out.  We don't have that many Internet devices, but what happens is whole blocks of addresses  get assigned to universities, Internet service providers, and there are some universities  that have, you know, like 400 million addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Plus once every device in the world gets connected, then that's what's going to happen.  Then you will run out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they've come up with a solution, IP version six.  So it's four billion, two to the 32th addresses.  This new one is two to the, they've added another eight bits, another byte.  It's five bytes.  So that would be two to the 32 squared.  It's a lot.  It's in fact, they say more addresses, not squared.  I don't know.  Two to the 128th, that's what it is.  It's so many addresses, it's 128 bits.  So it's so many addresses that you could give every molecule in the galaxy its own Internet address,  and you'd still have some left over.  In fact, so many addresses that...  How many addresses?  It's a lot of addresses.  So many addresses that there's a company called Hurricane Electric,  which has become kind of a big proselytizer for IPv6, he.com,  that will give you an IPv6 address.  Actually, they'll give you a block of addresses.  They'll give you a block of addresses so big that it's actually bigger than the current IPv4 total universe.  Free.  They just give it to you.  So today is a test day in which many websites, including Facebook and the Google,  will offer IPv6 packets to see if it breaks.  And so far, I think we're going all right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're doing pretty well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google predicted fewer than 1% errors.  That is 1% of people not being able to reach their site because their router is misconfigured  or their Internet service provider is misconfigured.  Google's doing it.  Yahoo's doing it.  As I said, Facebook is doing it.  I don't see current numbers, but the estimates were maybe as many as a million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I saw like 0.3%, 0.4%,  which I think amounted to about a million total of what, like 2 billion Internet users?  Still, that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A million people who can't get to work, so it's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of the however many billion.  Well, this will see.  I also think one of the big things for the switch is it gets rid of,  or it's trying to provide unique IPs for like every device, right?  As opposed to get around a lot of the problems with like NAT and DHCP,  where you've got to route internally and to get to a device,  then you have to go through a router, I think isn't the goal also with IPv6.  It expands the protocol and improves the protocol from IPv4,  and it does give you or aims to give you like direct devices,  direct connections to devices, direct addresses for devices without having to do all that routing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most people, it's really not designed to see if end users are broken.  Most people won't see any problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the IPv6 in general, that transition, part of that is  so that you don't have to deal with all the hassle.  You don't have to be like a network admin to get your devices all connected at home and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just need a new router, even new hardware.  Most operating systems are IPv6 capable.  Most routers are, currently sold routers are not.  I think Apple stuff is of all things, but most ISPs haven't done it either.  In fact, there's some speculation that most ISPs will just get around this whole thing by doing what's called IPv6 NAT,  where they'll do the NATing for you.  They'll still give you an IPv4 address and they'll use IPv6 NATs.  So it actually could get quite ugly.  We shall see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like a Google I.O. and everyone shows up with like a laptop and a phone and sometimes a tablet.  So people have three devices on them that connect to the network.  And then they wait to give you the giveaway because they know that everyone's going to fire up yet another device on their person  that's going to be connecting to the network.  I mean, we're going to come to a point where every person has several devices on them at one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That saved us for a long time.  One of the reasons we didn't run out of addresses sooner.  I know Vint Cerf, I remember talking to Vint Cerf 10 years ago and he said, we're going to run out of addresses.  And he should know he's the father of the internet.  But he was the guy who came up, I think, with a protocol.  But it turned out NAT address routing in your routers everywhere saved us for a long time.  But we are now, in fact, in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've got a different question, though.  When everything has a SIM, your car now has a SIM.  I'm carrying three or four devices that have SIMs.  You, Leo, carry 40 devices that have SIMs.  We are going to and they all have phone numbers, which I don't necessarily understand why they need to.  But we're really going to run out of phone numbers, aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting point.  We have 10 digit phone numbers.  So, yeah, you could see pretty quickly we'd run out of phone numbers.  There has been some talk, I think, of going to 11 digit phone numbers, which probably would break every call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to have to happen eventually, right?  I mean, phone numbers have been kind of expanding over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, we have an interesting, actually, this brings up kind of an interesting question that I hadn't really thought about talking about on this show.  But actually, this would be the perfect show to talk about it.  So we're building a new studio.  It's a big office.  We have 17 employees.  It's a 10,000 square foot studio.  We'll probably have many more employees down the road.  Normally, when you build an office, you put a phone system in, don't you?  A what?  A phone.  I bet you right now on your desk, Jeff Jarvis, you have, you know, some sort of PBX phone system.  Yeah, barely. It's the world's worst system.  City University has.  So my question is, is that a great I saw you shaking your head, Gina.  Is that what should we do?  We can't.  What we're looking at is a virtual phone system.  It's basically an hosted asterisk server.  And then you buy phones, but it's $20 per seat per phone.  And I'm starting to think.  What do you even need a phone in a business for anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At UC San Diego, all the new buildings built on campus like brand new construction, no phone lines, no cable lines.  Wow.  Just just high speed, just just high speed Internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's basically we have the new studio has 35 megabits symmetric, plenty of bandwidth.  Every employee has a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Gina, there's no there's no in university phone number for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are.  This is just for new buildings, new construction that they're not they're not running landlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're in this weird transitional state.  Yeah, we are.  Where some of my employees would like a phone on their desk.  Some of my employees will like to use their cell phone.  Some of my employees would like to use Google Voice or Skype.  I think that's what I'll use.  I'll just have a IP based solution on my desk.  I was thinking, should I have a.  But what happens now?  We have a receptionist at the front lobby.  Do you have a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is a good and I should say that I'm talking about student like residential student buildings.  I'm not talking about administration buildings, administration buildings.  Faculty do have phones on their desks still.  But we can get interesting choice.  We have virtual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a virtual service right now called Grasshopper.  It's an 800 number.  When you call it, there doesn't ring any phones here.  It just rings whatever.  So everybody's got an extension on it and you tell it what to ring.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's not my house when people use trunk lines and stuff and you and the number that shows up on your phone, the callback number is not the right number.  Most irritating thing on earth today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know that people in their homes are kind of slowly getting rid of landlines.  Yeah.  But if you're doing a modern business, I don't even know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you've got to go.  I think all decisions when you come to a fork in the road, Leo, you of all people have to take the modern fork.  I think so.  There's no U-turn for you, man.  You're going forward.  No phones.  That's it.  Well, I mean, our producer is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, Eileen is one of the few people in the business who would be making outbound calls to guests and then have to have them call her back.  So I would think Eileen, you would want a phone.  She's going, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She uses her cell phone.  Maybe not a desk phone.  Well, that's the thing.  You know, but we don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's cheaper to buy a landline than to buy every one of them a cell phone.  I'm not going to give everybody company cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you can give them.  I think they just use Google Play.  I use an iPhone at home and it doesn't work very well.  Right.  You know, an Internet based one.  But Eileen, she should go to Android with all choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, she's an Android user.  She does a show called All About Android.  I don't think that's a question.  Exactly.  So she's got to use that.  She's using a Nexus S.  I don't know.  I think it's a very interesting question that I hadn't really thought about.  But we sat down yesterday and said, OK, we have an IT guy.  What are we going to do about phones?  It's like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's going to happen in the new Apple spaceship?  Oh, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see the video?  First of all, I have to say, Steve was on stage on Monday at the WWDC.  And by the end, he seemed very, I felt really bad for him.  He seemed very tired.  He was very thin, very frail.  There's a very touching picture on the San Francisco Chronicle God of him and his wife at the end of it.  And it's a beautiful moving picture.  But I have to say, very sad.  And now we see a video of Steve.  I guess he's still got a lot of energy pitching this Cupertino City Council on building a spaceship.  It's like a round Pentagon.  It's a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The presentation was as if he were presenting the iPad.  The presentation was just very familiar, kind of Steve style.  These are these incredible numbers that you can't possibly disagree with.  We're putting more trees in.  The cadence was very similar to his consumer product launch presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should I play a little bit of this?  It's on YouTube.  I guess it must have been on the local City Council channel or whatever it is that they have in Cupertino.  This is Steve Jobs addressing the Cupertino.  Let me see if I can get this going here.  City Council.  City Council.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get one card here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, there's nobody in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, wow. If anybody knew he was going to do this.  Well, maybe they close it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought people showed up after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just him.  I thought I saw people.  He's just sitting in the front row there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple CEO, Mr. Jobs to be here and sharing the information with us.  Welcome, Mr. Job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Job and then the train whistle.  There are a couple of people.  Here comes Steve with his bottle of water, his black turtleneck and his skinny jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have a very light agenda tonight just to highlight your presentation.  I don't have much of a presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mostly just came down to tell you something and get your feedback on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is the wrong video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not the right video?  We started an Apple in my parents' garage 30 years ago.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many times has he gone to talk to the Cupertino's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he definitely gave it like a keynote.  The one I watched.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe I watched it.  You're right.  It's the wrong one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I've been told.  Chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's go to the Wall Street Journal.  They've never steered me wrong.  How about the San Jose Mercury News?  They have to have the right video.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Link in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, chat room.  YouTube.  I showed the wrong YouTube video?  So that's another presentation.  You can actually watch Steve Jobs present to the ...  It looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At this time we have Sarah Miller-Manderson in presentation, and it is my honor to call ...  I'm going to take a little things out of order.  It actually is under oral communication.  As you know, Cupertino is very famous for Apple Computer, and we're very honored to have Mr. Steve Jobs to come here tonight.  This was a love fest, by the way.  To give a special presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They wanted free Wi-Fi, free iPads.  I mean, it could stop.  There's an audience here.  Okay.  Do you think they had Apple employees in the front row as they do at Steve's other keynotes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome, Mr. Jobs.  It looks like you have a fan club here.  Thanks, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  I was ... Apple's grown like a weed.  And as you know, we've always been in Cupertino.  Started in a little office park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He did this the day after WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was yesterday.  It was yesterday.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me see if I can skip ahead to find the pictures of the ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does seem tired.  He does seem kind of like the plotting ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm kind of glad I played the other tape because you can see that he's tired.  You do see a difference.  Yeah.  So this is the site.  They bought a large parcel from Hewlett-Packard.  And they're going to put a giant ring.  It's a donut.  It's like the Pentagon, only it's a circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a pretty amazing building.  Let me show it to you.  It's a little like a spaceship landed.  But there it is.  It is! Look at it!  And it's got this gorgeous courtyard in the middle, but a lot more.  You know, this won't be done until 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to think that in some ways he might think this is his legacy, you know?  It's a circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it's curved all the way around.  As you know, if you build things, this is not the cheapest way to build something.  There's a straight piece of glass on this building.  It's all curved.  And we've used our experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where I went wrong with the Twitt Brickhouse.  It's all curved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You weren't making the iPad of buildings, though.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Glass in the world for architectural use.  And we want to make the glass specifically for this building here.  We can make it curved like this all the way around the building.  And you can see what it will look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's, by the way, that's the girl in the 1984 commercial.  She just needs a hammer right there.  Again, today.  They're also going to add trees.  All the parking is underground, which is kind of cool.  Yeah.  This is going to be a cool building.  I imagine that Cupertino City Council will approve it.  They're going to add 40% employees to 13,000 employees.  Well, that makes them happy.  Yeah.  They're going to increase the trees to 6,000.  And all the parking is going to be reduced and put underground.  90% of the parking is underground.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, he's aiming to make a building that he said architecture students will come to look at this building.  And the city council questions were just, I mean, they were all just so wowed.  I mean, they must hear presentations from the dumbest people because they seem just over the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me, I'm in my 50s.  So I think that a lot of them want to live around where they work.  We have a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually very hard for me to watch Steve.  He's so ill, obviously, Ilan.  Oh, man.  Boy, what a genius.  And I hope he gets to build this amazing building.  I hope he gets to see it.  Because it will be a legacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It will be an amazing legacy.  They hope to break ground, I think.  Next year.  Next year, 2012.  So it takes three years to build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a couple of good moments in that presentation.  There was a point at which the city council asked when it will be done or when the hill break down.  They'll break ground.  And Steve said something like, well, I've been asking my people that same question, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why do I know that feeling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a moment of humanity.  Even Steve Jobs has to harass people to meet deadlines.  That is a common managerial issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of Apple, they've updated iTunes, as you know, to support the cloud.  In fact, they're just downloading the new version.  They've announced a new cloud music service to compete with Google's and Amazon's.  And I think Compete It does.  They paid a fairly hefty license fee.  It's thought to be more than $100 million to the four major labels for the right to do music fingerprinting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which Google was supposed to be prepared to do, too, but they couldn't reach an agreement.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and if you think about it, this is brilliant because it's going to cost 25 bucks a month.  I bet you Apple gives most of that to the record industry.  It's a piracy tax because you're paying 25 bucks a month for Apple to replace all your pirated cuts with high quality,  256 kilobit AAC cuts.  You don't have to upload the music.  You just have to run iTunes.  Did I say a month?  It's 25 bucks a year.  I'm sorry.  25 bucks a year.  And I'm sure that the deal, what they said to the music labels, look,  yeah, maybe they ripped the songs from a CD they bought or maybe not.  But either way, they've got the music.  If you do this, you're going to get 25 bucks a year out of them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The labels are going to get the 25 bucks a year?  I bet you it all goes to the labels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what the deal is.  Maybe 70 to 30, like the traditional Apple split.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the iTunes match stuff, right?  So this is like Shazam.  Like I know that you have the song.  Exactly.  Apple knows what songs are in your library anyway.  So then they just, you stream the high quality version?  They basically give you the high quality version?  No, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no streaming.  But you download it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So you're basically, you're replacing your collection of maybe or maybe not pirated,  low quality stuff with a high quality version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They may have streaming down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not necessarily low quality either.  I know a lot of people who are kind of angry about the idea that it's 256 and you're paying  like $25 to downgrade your music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you have flack or a 320 kilobit MP3s, maybe you'll be unhappy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I suspect streaming may come down the road, but as far as I understand right now, there's  no streaming, which is weird.  So you're telling it, I own all of these songs.  It's very uncloudy.  Yeah.  Well, even all of this iCloud is a little bit uncloudy.  And this is unclear again.  We won't know until iOS 5 comes out later this year, probably September.  But what they kept saying is whenever you put something in the cloud, it downloads it to  every device.  It's like Dropbox.  Presumably, they're selective syncing.  And the screenshots I've seen on iOS 5 on songs anyway are you could just click each song  one by one and say download that one, download that one.  But you'll put them on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually unclear how much it's like Dropbox because with Dropbox, of course, it all lives  in their cloud.  They were talking about something that I didn't entirely understand with iCloud where there's  a 30-day limit where it stays on the server before it goes to your devices.  And then they say if you didn't get it in 30 days, you had plenty of time to get it.  You didn't want it.  Well, that's weird.  So they take it off after 30 days?  There's some 30-day history limit that they were talking about.  And it was really unclear what that actually meant.  But yeah, I don't know if that was...  Music's different because they're hosting the music and they've got apparently this  huge thing.  18 million songs.  But your files or your photos, the photo stream, there was like a 30-day history thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  That's for photos, I think.  And then there's the...  And this was unclear too, but it sounded like if they don't have it in their 18 million  song collection, you can upload it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there is some cloud storage.  I mean, most of it's not because most of it's just saying, wait, we got that song, we got  that song, we got that song.  They don't just one copy for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's still a big question as to how well that's all going to work with the  fingerprinting.  I agree.  And Apple said, Google's or jabbed at Google and was like, it takes you weeks to upload  all of your music.  And then with this, it'll take minutes.  If you have a reasonably large library and it actually is fingerprinting all of them,  I'm assuming it'll take more than minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It took me two days.  I have 7,000 songs.  It took me two days to get it up to Google Cloud.  But I have it now on every Android device I have, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it took me a few days.  And it wasn't like it was a painful few days.  It's a few weeks, then it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  I'm not thinking about it.  In fact, it's on my system right now.  Anytime I add a new song to iTunes, it'll automatically go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if you're someone who actually doesn't manage all your music with iTunes, it actually  actively monitors your music folders.  So you don't have to, like with iTunes, if you add music to a folder, unless you use  it to Apple's automatically add to iTunes folder, unless you put it in there, iTunes  is never going to know when you put a new song into like a file structure or a folder  structure.  But Google Music will.  It monitors the folders and it uploads anything in the folders you tell it to and on multiple  computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So everybody's in the chat room saying it's photos only that has the 30 day limit, not  music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  What about documents though?  I mean, because that's a different, that's kind of unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, fortunately, we have the great Shakespearean actor Richard Dreyfuss to explain it all for  us.  on their Friday reporters round table podcast asked Richard Dreyfuss for a dramatic reading  of the iTunes EULA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Listen, please read this software license agreement carefully before using the Apple  software by using the Apple software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's supposed to be Richard the third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are agreeing to be bound by the term or Lear.  If you do not agree to the terms of this license, do not use the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the best one, he does a, he does a good Habermas impression.  Oh, yes.  Listen carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  License is effective until terminated.  Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from Apple.  If you fail to comply with any terms of this license, upon the termination of this license,  you shall seize all use of the Apple software and destroy all copies full or partial of  the Apple software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to, you have to think that's exactly how Steve Jobs imagined it when he wrote that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  year.  Let a thousand remixes bloom.  That's awesome.  Everybody in the chat room is freaking out asking for a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's CNET, CNET's reporters roundtable.  Yeah.  And there's more.  I didn't even, I didn't even do it all.  There's quite a bit more.  I think I found it on Boing Boing.  Yeah.  Cory Doctorow linked to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The link has been posted.  The link has been posted in the chat room for all and sundry to enjoy.  Thank you, Richard Dreyfus.  He's, I guess he's kind of a geek.  I've heard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  I went to some tech conference where they had him speak.  Yeah.  It was odd, but you know, he was, he was into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more Gina Trapani.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Trapani is here from Brooklyn and also from smarterware.org and thinkupapp.com.  Also, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and buzzmachine.com and Adam Pash  from Lifehacker all here to talk about Google and the cloud.  We'll talk a little bit more about Apple's announcements, but there's a lot more from  Google as well.  There's actually a lot to talk about in general.  It's a good day for Googlers.  Before we talk about that, though, I do want to say that you ought to have a website.  You really ought to have a website.  If you don't, I've got the place to go.  People ask me all the time, where's the best hosting?  Where should I go?  I tell them there's hosts and hosts, but if you want hosting plus the best content management  software, there's really in my mind only one place to go.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.  It's hosting, yes, and very, very high quality, really good uptime.  They handle, get the slash dot dig twig effect very well.  It's very hard to bring down a Squarespace site because they have virtual server technology  that just flips on bandwidth as necessary.  But also, I think this is really important.  They have the software that they use to generate sites on Squarespace is super slick, super  beautiful, and always secure because it's automatically up to date.  That's the advantage of doing hosting plus software.  There's iPhone and iPad apps.  I keep lobbying for the Android app, and I know it's coming soon.  There's great stats.  There's templates that just are gorgeous.  The beauty of the templates is you're not stuck with 60 or so templates because they're  infinitely customizable without your knowing any JavaScript or CSS.  You just slide things around.  It's just very simple to use.  Now, if you do happen to know JavaScript and CSS, the sky's the limit.  You can customize it in any way you want.  In fact, when we set up our inside twit.tv blog, we made sure it looked like the rest  of the twit material, and that's totally easy to do.  If you don't have a site, you need a site.  If you have a friend that has a business that doesn't have a site, this is a place to go.  It starts at $12 a month, but you can save money by looking at their long-term subscriptions  as well.  Great for photographers if you're an artist of any kind.  Your portfolio site's on here.  In fact, go to squarespace.com slash twig and then click the examples button to see all  the different beautiful sites people do with Squarespace.  Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  I just picked one.  This woman is a graphic designer and a custom chalk letterer living in Brooklyn.  She does these on the street.  That's chalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay, Brooklyn.  Go, Brooklyn.  This is so cool.  Squarespace site.  You could get like, oh, we should get this.  This is like what people do on there.  So this is Sterling Cooper Draper Price, Mad Men Holiday Soiree 1965.  That's funny.  So this is her portfolio.  This is all in Squarespace.  The Wes Anderson Brooklyn, St. Mark's Avenue.  This is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it just goes away.  What?  It's on the sidewalk.  It's chalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, sometimes it's like you've seen these on menu boards in restaurants and stuff,  like over bars, like over the bar and that kind of thing.  Weird.  Isn't that cool?  Anyway, my point being not so much this, but this is a Squarespace site and that's the beauty of it.  If you are looking for a great site, please just visit Squarespace.com slash twit.  Click that green button that says try it free.  And you can try it for two weeks without a credit card or anything.  You just set up a site, play with it, get to know every bit of Squarespace and see if it's what you want to use.  Squarespace, and I love the examples.  It's a nice place to go.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of our show this week in Google.  I'm kind of sad.  Remember that Google had like Google.com slash Apple and Google.com or I guess it was that slash Mac and Google.com slash Linux.  And they had Google.com slash Microsoft.  These were all specialized search sites.  And Google just posted on their blog yesterday, we're going to kill those because frankly, you don't need them.  We're seeing if I go there now if there's anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm sure they just didn't have very much use.  Nobody used them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stopped using them a long time.  Yeah, so this is Google.com slash Mac.  It just takes you to the main Google page or slash Linux.  But it was just kind of a restricted Google search.  Yeah, they're all turned off already.  No specialized search services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There seems to be some house cleaning.  Last week we talked about the APIs they killed.  Now they're killing this.  I think they're...  That's appropriate.  Yeah, Larry says focus, I'm sure.  Quite appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still get your Google search results.  Oh yeah, the results are there.  In different languages.  But they still support some of those goofy...  Oh, bork bork.  Yeah.  So, you know, they haven't killed all of the fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How long before they kill that, right?  I love that.  I think that's hysterical.  Look at these are...  Now, it's display tips in, and these are all the languages.  And most of them are real languages, but then some of them are a little weird.  Bork bork bork is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And isn't there a Star Wars one or Star Trek one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's Elmer Fudd.  Oh right, Elmer Fudd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  I like Hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, those can't see very much usage either, but you know, they get the hit of traffic every time.  Once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We mention it, and there's a spike.  Seychelles-Waakriel.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sudanese, Swahili, Swedish.  That is actually very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is quite a language drop down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing.  Zulu, Pashto, Maori.  But I wonder...  Oh, Klingon.  Klingon.  Klingon.  I wonder if you get a lot of...  I'm going to do...  From now on, I'm doing all my searches in Klingon.  Let's see what happens.  Your preferences have been saved.  Oh dear.  I am going to be so sorry I did this.  Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would not have voted.  Google translate?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would that be wonderful?  How would I do that?  Can I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to translate...  Google.com slash translate, you can pick from all their drop downs, but I've looked at  it.  They normally announce when they have new languages, and I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no Klingon there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  JK.  No, just Korean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh shoot.  They'd have to get some...  There are people who speak Klingon, right?  You could get somebody to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Too bad.  Yeah, you just need the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, but see now I've got a problem because I have no idea how to turn that off.  I don't know what anything means.  Oh wait a minute, there it is.  Google.com in English.  That's nice that they put that right there too, because I was an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The damas...  Fuck.  A car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give me that.  Is that...  I don't even...  Somebody wrote that.  Somebody...  That's somebody's 10% project.  20% project.  Oh, there was a line to do that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I could translate that into Klingon for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They need to get up to date and add Navi or the newer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ewok.  Ewok.  Kazakhstan, I don't know what this story is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kazakhstan, which is Google...  This is fascinating.  You think this is...  Google.kz is a Kazakhstan search.  It's just like Google.c and is for China.  But the Google.c and servers as we know are not in China.  They're in Hong Kong.  Kazakhstan has said, if you want a Google.kz, you have to host the servers in country.  What does that mean, Jeff?  Well, it means that then they can shut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so Google will say, no, we're not going to do that.  So if somebody types in .kz, they just redirect them right away to Google.com.  And they're saying that's a pity because they can't target the searches.  But of course, I would think they can.  Just based on IP address.  So I think they're just getting a little tough there.  But that is one of the scary ways that countries will try to control the Internet.  Hello, Sarcozy, right?  Right.  And Eric Schmidt says, for example, that the single point of failure for the Internet is  country domains.  So now I've solved my Klingon problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All my searches are in Kazakh.  Was it Russia?  What is it?  It's Cyrillic.  I could see the Cyrillic.  I could see the Cyrillic character.  Or no, is it?  I don't even.  Oh, great.  You know, I wonder if it's more than just filtering the searches.  I wonder if there's also some interest if they host their servers there in going to  the servers and saying, OK, what did this guy look for?  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's privacy as well.  And if Kazakhstan gets away with it, you know darn well that China and Iran and pick your  totalitarian bozos will do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, it's easy to say no to Kazakhstan.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like Kazakhstan has the muscle to say, we're going to cut you off, Google.  But we have to go to our ambassador.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, now I'm going to miss the punch line.  What was the guy's movie?  Borat.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Borat.  Yes.  Is he from Kazakhstan?  Something like Kazakhstan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it was Kazakhstan.  Was it in the chat room?  Was he from Kazakhstan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're still talking about the chat rooms like, what language do gritos speak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You shouldn't really mention Star Wars stuff because then it's really they go off track  so very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting that Jeff said that, you know, they probably could provide the personalization  just by checking the incoming IP address.  That seems like they're making a point that they refuse to do this because they're in  support of the open Internet.  This is very much Google's open Internet stand being made publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what I see.  You know, at some point we end up with server farm on the ocean in a new land called Google  stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's like pirate radio, right?  In the, you know, in the old days in when Great Britain tried to send radio stations,  they put the radio stations on a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you go out to the to the, you know, water cooled wave powered server farms or server  ships now.  And you know, I'd move to Google stand with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lonely dark place of boring servers.  It's really loud servers.  But sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, one of the things that got a lot of attention on the Apple announcements was the fact that  iOS 5 is going to have very tight integration with Twitter.  Basically all the Apple apps, you'll be able to tweet from the app directly.  You'll only have to log into Twitter in the Apple preferences.  And from then on, everything will know what your Twitter account is.  And there's an API.  So developers presumably will also build in that kind of tight integration to Twitter.  A couple of things came to mind.  I mean, a number of people said, oh, that's a slap to Facebook.  Because, you know, basically Apple's throwing this is about that internet identity thing  we talked about, Jeff, last week, which is exactly who is your where does your canonical  identity on the internet?  Is it at Jeff Jarvis?  Is it Facebook dot com slash Jeff Jarvis?  What is what is your end or Google profiles slash Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, the way you phrase that is very good.  I thought it was, you know, I guess Jobs said that trying to do a deal with Facebook was  prohibitive.  Onerous.  Onerous was the word he used.  The problem with Twitter, of course, is that you can make up identities right and left.  The proportion of, you know, true identities in Facebook has to be much, much higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  So, right.  So there's an advantage Facebook has because those are real identities.  But do we care if we're, you know, I have I have multiple Twitter accounts for different  purposes.  Me too.  And it would make sense for me.  Well, first of all, I hope Apple allows multiple accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, why do they need to?  They're using it.  They're not using it.  The advantage of Twitter is I can use it as a published name to the world.  Right.  The advantage of Facebook is it's a more verified really me.  Right.  The irony of what of what Apple did here was what they really need is a verified you so  that they can have a unique account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to, for instance, in news applications, I want to tweet to my news link Twitter feed.  It's called links for twit links underscore four underscore twit.  And then but for personal stuff, I want to do it to Leo Laporte.  So when I take a picture of the kids, I want to go to Leo.  Maybe maybe I even will have different feeds depending on is this for family?  Is this for public?  I hope Apple supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like the kind of customization you're not going to get out of.  Apple ain't going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds like a nerd problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's a nerd problem.  I think it actually addresses kind of exactly what you were just saying, which is that Facebook,  you have a canonical identity that's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And on Twitter, you may have multiple because it's a publishing medium.  Now, but I had another thought about Twitter.  I thought this is this is publicly the Twitter folks are probably going, yeah, that's great  for Twitter.  Privately, they're going, oh, crap, because now they can't change their API.  Right.  They can't.  Apple is in effect frozen.  They what you know, if Apple is using the API, you know, remember, Twitter can keep  changing the ground under these third party developers.  Yeah.  Well, it can't do that anymore.  Why not?  Because Apple has turned Twitter from a company to a internet system to, you know what I'm  saying?  It's a utility now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it may be slower to deprecate and change existing methods.  A lot slower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they're going to have to get Apple's buy in on that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  The main thing is that Twitter, I mean, the main thing is that you're just using it to  tweet from like applications and stuff.  I feel like it's pretty limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe.  But it may be.  I mean, Android is the funny thing is about three quarters of the things Apple announced  on Monday are already in Android phones, including the notification system.  But on an Android phone, and some people don't like this, you can use Twitter with your contact  list to provide additional details as you can Facebook pictures or phone, you know,  Facebook has phone numbers.  And you can have a lot of personal information.  But I think in some ways, Apple made Twitter something less than Twitter was.  It made Twitter something both simultaneously more and less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  But all Twitter has to do is call Apple and say we're making this change.  They're going to let them know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the problem, of course, though, is you get in the same situation that you're in with  like Google Maps on iOS, where it's baked into the distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if Apple says, no, I don't think you're going to change that API call.  Well, they can't just update an application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got to wait for a full operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple literally could say, no, we won't.  If you don't, you might break iOS, but we're not going to change anything.  And that's then that's 20 million Twitter users who go, what the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, now Twitter will know what it feels like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, normally the way that it goes is that you release a version of an API and you commit  to supporting that version to a certain point.  So version 1.0 is out and then Twitter releases version 2.0.  They're still supporting 1.0.  It's like Windows XP.  We will support this up until this time.  They're going to give Apple plenty of notice.  I mean, this is kind of.  But new developers will be able to take advantage of the new API calls while they kind of slowly  sunset the existing ones.  I just think that this is going to make that road map, that timeline a little longer, right?  Because Apple's releases, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you don't think you don't think it kind of promotes the notion of Twitter as internet  infrastructure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's right, too.  It does.  But it's it's it's it's a it's not a good infrastructure because it doesn't do identity  well. And B, more importantly, it's scary because it doesn't think of itself as an  infrastructure company. It's it's going its own way.  You know, I can imagine I haven't read Dave Weiner on the topic, but I can imagine he's  going baddie. Right.  No one said that, Dave, I'm not saying you're baddie.  I'm just saying that the topic would make one baddie, anyone, including me, baddie.  OK, making clear here.  But this is the problem of being trapped with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a kind of a bear hug from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a big deal.  I think it's a huge, great deal for for for Twitter.  And, you know, if the one canonical identity or if the verifiable identity thing becomes  an issue, I mean, Twitter did start to roll out that verified identity mechanism, which  I don't think is available to most people.  I mean, right now, it's like for celebrities who might have impersonators, but they could.  I mean, it's not crazy stretching the imagination that they could extend that to anybody who  is willing to provide a phone number or credit card number to say, yes, this is me.  So that could kind of take care of the identity thing.  And I think it's huge.  I think it's going to I hope that Twitter can stand up to the traffic it will bring them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting because there were rumors that Apple might buy Twitter and instead  they just co-opted it free.  We got all the Twitter functionality free.  And that's kind of what I mean, is that Apple's just kind of piggybacking and said, good,  nice job, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple tried social with paying, right?  They couldn't get Facebook to go along.  Right. Facebook didn't really.  The Facebook integration was anemic.  They couldn't come up with a good deal.  So, I mean, this this this makes it makes a lot of sense.  And I'm excited. I'm excited that they went with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a fan. Well, you know, it makes me think I'll use Twitter a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it'll be right there. It's now it's now anointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's actually interesting, though, is that Twitter is now being integrated into the  operating system. But then there's all those other applications who who are which were  extremely popular applications like Instapaper or Camera Plus and whatnot.  Bye bye. They couldn't.  Well, they could have bought or they could have integrated in some way, but instead just  took the best functionality from those things and sort of made their own versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, if I'm Marco, I'm not happy about it.  He's the guy who created Instapaper.  But from the point of view of users, it's great that that Instapaper functionality is  built into the into iOS 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marco's got the same problem as as Twitter.  The Twitter sphere deals with the developers where  where Twitter has a new URL shortener.  And now you're all shortners are all freaked out because they can't.  And all of the stuff that Twitter.  But it's sort of like Apple doing similar things.  But but not with Twitter, where Apple probably knew they couldn't accomplish that  and decided just to go with go with the big horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm Gina. And I have this back and forth all the time where Gina is is the nice  one and I'm not, you know, my fear is if I were developing, I certainly would never  develop anything around Twitter now.  Right. Not like what you're doing, Gina, where you're adding on a kind of back end  Oh, but wait a minute.  Doesn't this make you something that uses the API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This makes you a little bit more comfortable with it because now does now Apple is.  Yeah, Apple's offering, in effect, a Twitter API in iOS 5.  Oh, so now you're not piggybacking on Twitter.  You're piggybacking on Apple piggybacking on Twitter.  And I'm saying Apple's a bigger, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but that doesn't affect that doesn't affect Bitly.  That doesn't affect the photo services that got screwed last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. And as Adam mentioned, Twitter announced today that they're going to build into their  web client, they're going to build into T.C.O.  shortening, although you could still use Bitly or the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the thing about that is what gets me about that is that the proportion, I don't  know what the number is. And I think there is a number somewhere.  It's a vast majority, though, isn't it?  Well, no, but the vast majority of people don't use the web client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You use third party clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I won't I won't notice that.  I mean, my my my echo phone will still use my own shortener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, but remember, in iOS 5 now, when you go to the preferences and you  authorize Twitter, there's also a button that says install the Twitter app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I finally get it.  OK, so that's what this is.  That's what because Twitter can't stand using all these.  So this is this is actually the deal with Apple is a way to now screw all of the third

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  party apps. Well, it's good.  But that's what I kind of meant was it's great for Twitter because but it's also in  some ways bad for Twitter because now there is there there more more of an  infrastructure service than they are a company.  But it also means that the plumbing for anything on top of them now.  Right. But because of the plumbing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's the that just shows Twitter is not a platform, a platform or something you  can develop a top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting. Well, now the question is, how do you monetize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so I really like Marco's take on what he says.  He basically said that he's cautiously optimistic about the fact that Apple built  this functionality into Safari because he is a small kind of one guy shop.  He has a really hard time explaining what is the paper does and what the value is.  And he's pretty convinced that it's the paper is better than Apple's  implementation. So he feels like by Apple rolling this functionality out to more  people, it'll get a much larger audience.  More people understand the value of what what it does and what it's the paper does.  And when they're hooked, they're going to look for something that's a little more  powerful and that's going to open up the market for him.  I agree that this is kind of a similar thing.  And I think that this is why Twitter went with the like, use our one canonical,  start with our one canonical iOS app.  It is the best. And this is what you should start with.  Because I think then once you have power, users have multiple accounts and want  different kind of functionality, then they start to look for the tweet decks and  the echo phones and the kind of more advanced kind of power tools.  So you can look at it as like this is a way to open up the market and make it easy,  you know, easy on ramp for new for newcomers.  Or you can look at it as like Apple just ate my lunch.  And I really I like that Marco said, I don't feel like Apple just ate my lunch yet.  I'm cautiously optimistic that this is going to make the paper more  understandable by a lot more people and maybe open up the market.  Because his you know, his his customer base, he feels like is is much  potentially much larger.  But that because it's hard to explain what is the paper does.  And he's one guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, right, because there's a lot of Windows users.  There's a lot of Chrome users just because Apple did it on Safari.  Doesn't I think he's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think especially the fact that it's just on Safari.  It's just kind of so limiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little annoying that they copied him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, I'm sure he feels that he's got to.  Yeah. Yeah. But also kind of, you know, it's kind of a pat on the back.  I mean, when when the Gmail engineers looked at my extension, better Gmail,  which is made up of user scripts by lots of other developers, I'm totally not not  taking credit. I just sort of bundled them together and said, oh, you know what?  We're going to build these into labs because they're doing really well in your  extension. I was like, that's great.  You know, like, I'm really glad I took it as a compliment in a way, in a way.  Of course, I wasn't building a business on that.  So, you know, it goes both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Marco's done well, and I don't think there's any question that  Instapaper will continue on and do well.  There's no doubt. And in fact, people like us, I think I will always pay for Instapaper  and continue to pay for Instapaper or whatever.  I mean, I bought the apps. I didn't need to buy the apps, but I bought them just to  support Marco. I think it's it's such a great thing.  All right. So we'll we'll see.  You know, the IOS won't be out till the fall.  We have lots to talk about in the fall.  I talked a little bit about Google's cloud service.  Do do does this change Google's cloud music in any way?  Does it change? Is it a threat to Google's stocks and other Google cloud services?  Or does this like like like Instapaper on the Safari?  Does this just validate what Google's up to and make a bigger business for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so unproven whether this will be workable, right?  Let's not forget about not me.  I find that iTunes in a brilliant UI company, I still find iTunes to be incredibly  awful, counterintuitive and awful.  And it's it becomes the basis of all this stuff.  Can I see putting all my documents and all this stuff through iTunes?  No, it's not quite enough.  No. And so, you know, Google's far from perfect on this either.  I mean, Dropbox, I'm not you got to pry out of my dead hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In terms of the functionality, you agree with Peter Kafka that iCloud music is a meh.  I don't know yet. I don't know.  I think we don't know yet.  He says Google and Amazon dodge a bullet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to say. I'm not even sure yet.  I actually didn't even realize I'm a bad tech news follower.  I didn't realize that 1010 three is out.  iTunes 10 three is out now.  So is iCloud is available in 10 supposedly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what it says in the upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically just the purchases.  So anything that you've purchased that that like being able to download it to all your  iDevices and Apple devices is live.  But the iTunes match isn't live.  And most of the most of the iCloud stuff isn't live in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm looking at the new iTunes now.  So you're saying, Adam, I can go to the iTunes.  What's this iBook store now on iTunes?  So I can go, can I go somewhere and say download everything I've bought on other systems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that you.  Oh, yeah. Look, look, look, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a new link purchased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Let's click that.  So these are all the songs I've ever bought.  And now I can.  And apps and books.  And apps and books.  I believe.  Yeah.  So and now.  This has been a long time in coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's about time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody else has done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not exactly innovation.  I mean, this is this is Amazon's locker kind of.  Right.  Or this idea that if you buy a digital thing like that, Apple will take care of it.  Will hold it for you, you know, between devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's a button that says this is everything I bought.  And this is the stuff that's not my currently in my library.  So these are all the songs that are not currently in my library that I have purchased.  Can I now just download them?  Yes, I can.  There's a little cloud icon.  And it says, like, yeah, you can download.  Disco zones, drag, Ostea, Din, Tay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So explain something to me when I want to next sync my phone and get audio files on my phone.  Am I doing that through a cable or am I doing that through the cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not until iOS 5, but in iOS 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In iOS 5, do I does it eliminate the sync cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would imagine that you still could use the sync cable.  Yes, in the same way that with Google Music, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't eliminate it because they even say specifically you can  use iTunes or you can do it from via the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because part of what I do, obviously, is I have a limited amount of space on one of my iPods.  And so I decree what goes there versus other devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you have some, you have some granularity, but not much.  You can either do it song by song or all of the above.  That's the wrong picture.  There it is.  Song by song or all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I get more granularity with the present iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But this is just with iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm assuming that, I mean, you can still, I'm assuming you can still sync to your iPod  or whatever selectively if you so choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's feeling mad to me.  This is all of this, all the crap my kid has purchased.  So, you know, you definitely, I'm not going to want to download all,  but if I say, oh, there's one song I like,  that's the advantage of having one account for the whole family, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's actually interesting because I've been playing around with Google Music a lot.  And in Google Music, they do have a, it's all based on your Google account.  And you can only stream, according to a Google Help page that I ran into  when I was going through the JavaScript, you can only screen stream to one place at a time.  Or that's what the page said.  So if my kid was streaming, I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least that's what the Help page was explaining that I was looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That actually makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then it's problematic if you share a library.  What do you do?  Do you run multiple instances of the uploader tied to multiple accounts?  I don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is one area that Apple actually has done very well.  The App Store is a good example.  Once you buy an application on the App Store on OS X,  then it's available to all your other computers as well.  Basically everything's a family license.  And I imagine they'll do the same thing with music.  There'll probably be a limited number of devices, maybe five.  But I think that's something Apple's done well.  And they can do that because they own the whole chain, right?  They know exactly everything.  Ten devices with a maximum of five computers can be synced with the service.  So you can have your iPhone, your iPad, and five other computers.  That's why you don't want a family license though.  Well, I mean, how many computers do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but even number of devices, right?  So I have a phone and two iPods and an iPad.  So there's four iPhones in my family.  In my family, I take up half the ten devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're unusual.  Family of four.  Are you saying how weird, Leo?  We're a family of four.  Let's say we've all got iPhones.  That's four devices.  We've all got computers.  That's eight devices.  Well, if you all have iPads, then you're screwed.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you all have iPads, you can afford to buy music separately.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just kidding.  One of my students in my entrepreneurial class this last term, a really good guy,  had a great business where I don't want to give away the business.  But Fred Wilson and his wife Joanne came and they judged the class.  And he had happened to use Fred's music to feed something wonderful out of his  algorithms and systems.  I'll just leave it there.  And the funny thing was, as soon as he showed on the screen, Fred and Joanne are both there.  And Fred said, well, that item came not from me because my wife, because we share the same account.  He said, if it's ridiculous torch songs, it's all Joanne.  And so what happens is if you want to get a picture of Fred's music taste.  His taste is very urban.  You can't because they mixed it in.  So there's a problem mixing into when you get to an age of personalization, when these become  signals of what you like that's usable elsewhere.  You don't want to mix in with your family.  You want to be you.  I want to be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's the other side of the problem where your kids are buying the same songs  you've already bought.  That doesn't happen very often though.  It's come to think of it, what was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, the one time that I bought back in the days of CDs in the car, I bought a hip hop CD.  My son just wanted to throw out the window that I'm not allowed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my turf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was creepy for me to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm totally convinced.  The only reason my son listens to hip hop is because it drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good enough reason as any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every generation has to have something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Annoy your parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do we annoy our parents?  And I feel sorry for them because there's so few things that annoy us  compared to our generation.  Facebook has kind of without much fanfare turned on face recognition on your Facebook account.  And the default is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm interested to hear what Jeff thinks about this, Mr. Public Parts,  about the idea that like someone that Facebook can suggest to others,  you know, this looks like Jeff, do you want to tag him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It ain't easy to find this setting, by the way.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As usual, they mess that up and you got to go way down to find the setting to turn off.  You got to dig.  But again, it sounds bad.  Facial recognition is turned on secretly.  What does it mean?  Well, it means that, you know, it's not much different from us.  The three of us have a picture together.  Four of us have a picture together and somebody comes along and they recognize any one of us  and they put it in there who it is.  So the computer helps that process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it doesn't bother me except that it, well, you can turn it off.  It's on by default.  It's a PR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a bad PR move.  Picasa on the desktop actually does that.  It'll recommend facial recognition to you.  Google does it too.  Oh, no.  And I think those same things sync to Picasa web albums, I believe, if you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's the same, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though, I mean, the difference, of course, is that you don't have to sync to web albums  and that convenience is local.  And not broadcast.  Small difference.  Oh, here's the check mark.  Kind of important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the check mark.  It's actually right on the front page of privacy settings.  Let friends of people tag to my, no, that's not it.  Is that it?  Let friends of people tagged in my photos and post, see them.  No, no, that's not it.  Where is it?  Customize settings, control how you share.  I'm looking.  Control how you share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's privacy settings.  Settings and then customize settings at the bottom of that.  Yeah.  And then from there you go down to suggest photos of me to friends.  There it is.  Other share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Suggest photos of me to friends.  Think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it does not show you what it is currently set to.  It just says edit settings.  Edit settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then it's enabled by default.  So you have to disable it manually because otherwise it's normally enabled.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As a PR move, it's all stupid.  As a reality, Mr. Private Parts doesn't think it's that bad.  What about you, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think we've had this conversation before about how  you can take certain measures.  If you want to be private about where you live or where you've been or who your friends are,  you can do certain things, right, to protect that information.  But you can't control what other people can do.  And it's so easy for other people to kind of share information.  And I think that that's one, you know, this is just another way.  And I think Adam's point is really good is like Facebook makes it so easy.  You know, the whole Picasso thing is like download, scan, upload.  I mean, Facebook makes it really easy.  So I listen, I'm not, I just, it enables your friends to broadcast information about you,  whether or not you necessarily want that to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do get notified and have can remove the tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  You have more control on Facebook.  I could put up a picture of you on my blog or on Flickr or anywhere on Google or anywhere  on the web, and you can't do jack about it.  That is true.  On Facebook, you have the ability to take off your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  That is absolutely true.  And I have had to go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?  Can you not remove tags from Flickr's when they tag people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's just text, isn't it?  Can I, I mean, if I, but if I just put in searchable text, Adam Pash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you just mean if you're a descriptor, because you can tag people on Flickr now.  Like people, as opposed to just text anyway.  But the thing about it is it's, what it's doing is it's taking a feature that they can  already do and it's not automatically tagging you.  It's automatically suggesting you.  It's recognizing your face and saying, Hey, I think this might be Gina.  And I think at the end of the day, like they're making it easier to do something that you  could already do anyway, and it's not forcing anyone to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it tells you that somebody just tagged you in a photo.  And so I click on that and I go look at it.  And if it's not me or for somebody, I don't want to be doing this.  I can unfriend them.  I can do all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.  And it still requires your friend to say, yes, this is Jeff.  Yes.  Tag him.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't address the larger issue though, of people who have their Facebook friends  tattooed on their arm.  When do I get the notice that my friend got me tattooed onto her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, I hope that I'm somewhere on your body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I've got a special place for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to make that happen at FU this weekend.  We're going to get the Jarvis tattoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This woman apparently has all 152 of her Facebook friends tattooed on her arm.  It is just so frigging.  Why not?  Why not?  You know, that's a sleeve.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is quite a sleeve.  It's actually kind of cool looking.  I like the-  It does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My question is, what if you want to break up with that person?  Are you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't unfriend.  Once the tattoo's there, there's no unfriending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Friends for life, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope that this person notified everybody whose image she decided to use on herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the ultimate tagging, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no control here.  I can't untag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Honeymoon II, the Army Bachelor Party II, right?  The Tyson tattoo has a copyright around it.  You saw that story, right?  Yeah.  They've got-  Yes.  They're suing.  Right.  So is that an appropriate use of my image on your arm, honey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just don't put it on your face, okay?  Yeah.  Then you might be in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On the media, they had me on this week to do EG8,  but they had a segment before that which was kind of great,  was saying that basically with the-  Well, I know it's the way off cloud,  but could the owner of the tattoo, if you had that tattoo on your face,  keep you from ever being pictured anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Isn't that interesting?  I saw some lawyers debate this issue, and it's really complicated.  So Mike Tyson has a tattoo on his face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he has a license from the guy for this specific purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the guy didn't actually trademark the tattoo until recently, okay?  So Hangover 2 comes out, and Tyson's in Hangover 1.  I don't know if the guy's- I mean, it's Mike.  Yeah.  But then the guy- and I think this is maybe legitimate,  that in Hangover 2, they copy the tattoo on another guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And Tyson's in Hangover 2 too. I thought that's the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, apparently it's okay for Tyson to wear it.  Because he has the license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so Tyson is suing- I didn't see the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the artist who created the tattoo for Tyson says,  that's my trade dress. That tattoo, I own that design.  You can't use it on another person. Tyson can appear in a movie because he's-  it's on his face. I guess just the virtue of the fact that it's on his face gives him a license, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And one lawyer said that if they're making fun of Tyson, then it's fair comment.  It's parody. That's exactly the defense.  But if they're making fun of the character in the movie,  and they're using the tattoo to that end, then it's a use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. If it's parody, it's another matter.  And you think bleak is off topic.  This sounds like UC might give a lot of money and I could make some by suing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's a game going on right now, a two-day-long game on Google,  that gives you a preview of a Chromebook. I don't know if you get a Chromebook if you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't understand.  Okay.  Plus, by the way, I almost did it on, what should we call it?  Guilt.  Guilt, but it was no returns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh.  No, you got to be able to-  You couldn't have the re-boxing, so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, don't re-box it. I reserved the right to re-box anything in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.  Including your tattoo.  Yes.  So you could get a Chromebook early, I guess is the idea. And so there are a bunch of links  that they've been putting up on the Google Chrome blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know that people are just dying to get the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the thing, are there people clamoring to get the Chromebook early? I don't know.  They've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People like getting free stuff. It's not like if they were in a contest to get an iPad 2  early or something like that. People participating are excited because they're going to get a free  computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  No, I think you still buy it. You just get it early.  Oh, that's why. I don't know why anyone's going to participate.  This is not, maybe I'm wrong, but that's the impression I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the stories that I saw said something about how Google, I think, tries to recreate  the Gmail invite scarcity kind of thing with a lot of new product launches. And nothing really  quite has been like that. But I wish you well, Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to get to our picks of the week, our tool of the week, our tip of the week,  our number of the week. And Adam's got a tip of the week.  So an extra bonus tip this week.

Time for our tool of the week from Ms.  Gina Tripani. Our tip of the week, I should say. Tip of the week. Google calendar rolled out a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  feature called appointment slots, which lets you define blocks of time on your calendar where  you're available to take appointments. And you can say, and what kind of time slots. You can say,  I'm available from one before on Thursday and half an hour slots and anybody can come book a time.  Which is really cool. Something I really enjoy. I try to batch my meetings into groups so I can  just knock them out one right after another. So you can set that up now. And actually I'm looking  at my calendar and I don't think I have this yet. Yeah. I think it's a slow rollout. I don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it either. But I think it's one of those couple of weeks things. It's good if you're a hairdresser

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  or you do manicures or, but you would use this Gina like for making a dates with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I frozen on Skype? That's awesome. It's a good picture too. I like it. Oh yeah. It's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  flattering. I love it. I'm just going to leave it there for a while. John Borthwick of Beta Works

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  used to use this all the time. I forget who it was. He did it with and they eliminated it,  but he would publish his availabilities. And if you see, he said, yes, let's meet.  He would send you there and you pick a time and you put it in. And that was that. Yeah. There are  a lot of services that do this. Right. So it was convenient. Yeah. I don't know. The problem I have  with the overload. I mean, Leo, if you did that, everybody would say, but Leo, I just want five

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  minutes. Right. I don't have a slot. I see you have five minutes there. Yeah. That's why I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't have slots. No. Yeah. It's good for like office hours. Like if I want to be kind of  available, my developers come set an appointment, that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  thing. Yeah. I don't see it on my, where would it, how would I know? I don't even know. When you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when you click to create a new event, it would show up as like a possible option in that box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cool. Did you know that you can send, you can create events via SMS text messages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's crazy. Google calendar has a lot of like hidden stuff like that. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. It's amazing. So I can text my, I can text G V E N T and add something to my calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can, you can text that short code today and get your list of appointments or tomorrow,  get your list of appointments via SMS. It's crazy. Sorry. My video's out. I'm, I'm, it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  my button is. I actually pay for a service called dial to do that I might not need anymore,  especially because the Android dictate, by the way, there, isn't that interesting that Apple did  not add that to iOS five. I don't, there's some rumors that maybe they planned to, and then weren't  able to make a deal with nuance, but there's no, uh, currently anyway, there's no voice dictation to  iOS five, which is a big feature in Android. They did add the notifications though. They,  they've, they totally copied the Android notifications, but I'm fine with that. They  needed to do that. There was such a terrible system. Uh, so you've got no video. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right, Gina. We're almost done. Yeah, sorry about that. I'm messing with press preferences right now  and I'm getting the beach ball, which is not, not promising. I can hear you and that's what I care

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about. Good, good. Meanwhile, Adam's going to give us double the money, double the tips. Adam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pash from lifehacker.com. Go ahead. Okay. So, uh, you may have seen a few weeks ago, uh,  Gmail and AOL got together to let you add aim AOL instant messenger, AIM users to your Google chat,  um, inside Gmail. So if you use Google chat with, uh, to talk to people, but you also have aim  buddies and whatever, you can, uh, import them into your Google chat. So you don't have to have  a separate chat client. You can chat with them all from there. Um, there's a mass importer at,  uh, aim.com slash import dash two dash Gmail. Uh, and it'll import, I think like something like  38 of your most used aim buddies. And the cool thing about it is once you import them into  Gmail, Google talk, we'll chat, whatever it's supposed to be called. You can also, I am those  aim buddies from a talk on your Android phone too. So it sort of, uh, adds a new protocol  into what you can do with, uh, the default Google apps. So this is actually a, a, a AOL feature.  Well, it's a, it's an AOL feature integrated in directly into Gmail. Google and, and AOL got

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  together to, to make this happen. That's great. That's great. So Google talk now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so it always supported aim. You could log into aim from Gmail. Now it actually puts the aim contacts  into your Google contacts so that if you're using something like Google talk on your Android phone,  you can still, I am back and forth with those, uh, aim contacts as well as your regular Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  contacts. I'm going to do that right now. Awesome. Yeah. Awesome. Jeff Jarvis, our number of the week,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a little one here, uh, 30%. And that is the increase in Arab Facebook users this year alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. And that's cause the, uh, the Arab spring, I would guess. Yeah. Yeah. Holy cow. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it's wonderful. I went to the personal democracy forum the last two days, which was great.  And they had a lot of folks from Tunisia and Egypt and so on there. And, um, uh, I talked to,  uh, one researcher who just got back from Egypt who said that, you know, there's kind of a little  bit of a backlash here is that the revolutionaries want credit. They don't want Facebook to get all  the credit. No one really gives Facebook all the credit. Uh, there are those who say that we do,  but no one does. Uh, but, uh, she said, you just can't tell this story without telling Facebook,  without using Facebook as part of the story. That's awesome. That's really awesome. Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  my tip actually, uh, piggybacks on a news story. I don't know if it's a true story or not,  but a rumor from Engadget that, uh, the Google maps tool would soon allow you to down or the  Google navigation, I guess it's Google navigate would soon allow you to download maps and have  off. In other words, give you offline access, a la Tom Tom or Garmin. It'll actually turn it into  a real GPS. The only thing missing right now from Google navigate is the fact that you have to be  online to use it. Uh, if that happens, that's a, that's a stunner. Google navigate can cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though, right? Like it will download and cash, but you're kind of not in charge of what it's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that's just a rumor. My tool is actually only available for  people who live in Brooklyn and San Diego and San Diego. They must've known you were there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina. I was like, this never happened. I was so thrilled because San Diego is never in the  list of cities that these things get rolled out in. It's a, and in San Francisco. So it's a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  useful thing in San Francisco because Muni is never on time. So now you can actually know  how long you're going to have to sit at the Muni bus stop waiting for the bus to come.  It's transit schedule information built into Google maps. I think this is about time. I really  am thrilled to have this. And I imagine they'll roll it out in other, uh, places soon enough,  but what a, what a nice feature. I guess it probably isn't everywhere because the transit  system has to somehow have some sort of way of signaling, uh, where the bus is scheduled or is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it current? No, it's current. It's current location. So, I mean, each, each bus has to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some sort of transmitter on it, right? I mean, how else, how else could they do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So that's the point is that I think you, you know, it's only going to happen in municipalities  where they've, they've got that, that infrastructure already there, but what a nice idea. In other  words, Petaluma, we're not going to know. It ain't going to happen in the Petaluma bus system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have buses in Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we do. They're little shirt buses.  They're little buses, they're little busses. They're little busses. Nobody takes them. They're  always empty. It's great. It's great. I don't even know what it costs. I've never taken a Petaluma  bus, but somebody must.  Ride a chicken.  That's about it for this particular program. Gina Trapani has lost her picture, but  I'm sorry.  Fortunately, she's still with us.  She's a disembodied voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Why does it seem to happen to me more than anyone else? I don't, I don't know. What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because you live in the cloud, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it. And the connection here is sometimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  wonky.  Your beauty breaks the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Thank you, Jeff. That's how I'm going to put it. This is a great show. It was awesome.  I love having Adam too. It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was fun. Yeah. Adam, you must come back. Gina is at smarterwear.org or thinkupapp.com.  And of course, her handle on Twitter is at Gina Trapani. We'll have to do this from now on because  Twitter is now the official internet identity service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blessed by Apple. We must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was watching MSNBC the other day. They didn't do lower thirds. They just did,  they didn't do people's names. They just did their Twitter handle underneath.  Twitter's?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just the Twitter handle? That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know how long, I mean, it's might've been just, I was watching for a few  minutes and you know, it's Lawrence O'Donnell and it's just at Lawrence. And I mean, it was,  I was really interested that they would feel like that's sufficient.  Now.  Now if they were in France, it'd be another matter. You heard that France banned that?  You can't, you can't say on French newscasts,  follow us on Twitter or Facebook because it's anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crazy.  Wow.  We want them in charge of the internet, don't we?  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess you were right about Sarkozy all along.  Gina, I will see you at Foo Camp in the Sebastopol this weekend and we'll get you on  Twitter right after if we can figure out the logistics.  Right on.  Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York. He's a professor there. That means he's  educated. He's also a writer at buzzmachine.com and his book, What Would Google Do and Look for  Public Parts in September. Brand new book. Great to have you.  I finished the galleries tonight.  Really? So, but you finished the book. So this is just like making sure there's no typos.  It's this praying that it's nothing horribly wrong.  Whenever I would get that, you know, like editor's copy, I would just go, yeah, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the book comes out and you want to jump off a bridge because you see a typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't care. You know what Cory Doctorow does is great. He has kind of this crowd source  typos. You get a free copy of the book if you find a typo and a footnote on that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. That's brilliant.  Cory's great. Great with the wuffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cory's amazing.  Good wuffy there. Adam Pash, thank you so much for being here. Adam is a writer for Life.  Actually, what's your title at Life, Adam?  I am editor in chief.  Not merely a writer. He's the man. He's the man at lifehacker.com.  Thank you so much for having me.  Thanks for being here. We really appreciate it. Thank you all for joining us  on this episode of This Week in Google. Make sure you tune in every Wednesday,  1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time. That is 2000UTC at live.twit.tv. Of course,  you get the show after the fact in audio and video at twit.tv slash twig. We are very close  to launching the new website. I'm very excited about that. It'll make it much easier. Each show  will have its own community around it, by the way. So we will have a chance to have kind of  interaction with people who watch the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, cool. Get me in that beta.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You bet. We'll get you in the beta. Absolutely.  And in some ways, that's what these bricks are ending up supporting. It all kind of goes into  the same fund. The bricks are to help us build the studio, but money that we can save on the  studio construction goes into the website design. And we're hoping to launch them both at the same  time. Bricks.twit.tv, if you don't have a brick yet. I was actually very moved. I went through the  first 650 inscriptions because they're about to laser them into the bricks. And I was just so  touched. There were memorials for people. There were kind words. It was just really neat. I think  it's really, I'm really glad we did it. I really am. Bricks.twit.tv if you want to get your name  or your Twitter handle or your company's name or even your company's logo, because we have on the  bigger ones, we have room for a logo. Bricks.twit.tv if you want to find out about it. If you're  international, go to that site, but you'll see a phone number. That's the number you need to call  to get international sales. Thank you all for being here. We're going to go on a tour of the  Twit Brick House right after this, by the way. So I hope you all stay tuned. Well, we got a lot  done. A lot done. TNT is coming up next though with Tom Merritt. Thanks everybody. We'll see you next  time on This Week in Google.  What's your dog's name, Adam? Buddy. Oh, see a lot of geeks like Nick Bilton's dog is named,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a lot of geeks have dog names, geek dog names. Yeah, he's, I mean, we call him Budman. You can see him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  thereabouts. Oh yeah, there's Buddy. Is he a, what is that, a Pekingese? He is probably miniature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pinchard, maybe a Chihuahua blend. He was a rescue who showed up on our doorstep, so we don't really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  know. He chose you.
