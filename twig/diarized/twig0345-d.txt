Oh, I am in New York City.  There's Jeff Jarvis.  This is a very realistic dream.  It's good to see you.  Welcome to New York.  It's great to see you.  We're in the CUNY studios.  Yes, we are.  And as if this dream couldn't get any better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hired a bunch of extras behind us  in the CUNY newsroom to make it look real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look who's here.  Now I'm really having a dream.  It's so good to see you, Gina.  Fist bump.  We're back together.  Hand hugs.  So glad you're here on our turf this time.  Thank you for coming over the bridge and joining us.  We really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am so thrilled to be here.  Is this nice?  Seven years, six years.  Wig in New York City, baby.  I'm all about it.  Times Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's exciting is this is the beginning  of something more than just this week in Google here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, we're gonna be doing a New York tech show  on the Twitter network from this very space,  coming up sooner than I can bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pilot soon.  Should we, let's bring in your dean.  The boss.  The boss.  Sarah Bartlett is very much instrumental in this.  Hello.  Dean Bartlett.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And thank you for letting us borrow your team  because there's camera operators and a director  and this is fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, this is what we do here.  It's only took us what, two years from the time  we hatched this idea in Petaluma.  I'm so thrilled to be here.  It's serious business.  I'm really delighted that it's gonna all pan out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're very excited about doing a show  from New York City too. Work him hard for me, okay?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I heard his schedule.  I think I will work him hard now that I know.  That's the idea.  No.  Hey.  Want our money's worth.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Nice to see you.  Really nice to see you.  This is the City University of New York's  Graduate School of Journalism.  Right.  And isn't it nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really nice.  These are some very nice dates.  Your tax dollars at work.  Yes.  Not bad.  Yes indeed.  I'm proud to be a CUNY graduate.  Amen.  Not from the School of Journalism.  I was Brooklyn College, but you know, same university.  CUNY's a wonderful institution.  Yes it is.  So it's a public school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we're the only publicly supported  graduate school of journalism in the Northeast.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And these are the students behind us.  This is actually the newsroom.  So.  You can see very much.  What are they working on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stories, journalism, man.  Is there a newspaper or what is it?  No, no, no, no.  They're working on stories for assignments.  And then over there are some of the entrepreneurial students  who are working on their businesses.  And they've done reporting day and they're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are ghosts in this building though.  Yes there are.  This is one of the most famous newspapers in the world.  The old New York Herald Tribune was here.  Yeah, and Rest In Peace.  Until 1966.  The newspaper started by Horace Greeley in the 1800s.  And a really great newspaper.  So this is kind of a nice feeling.  There's history here.  I really like being here.  It's a kind of old ground.  Old media, new media.  Yes.  Well there's some news and we can talk about that.  We wanna tip our hat to everybody in the chat room.  Yes, I can see you.  I don't know if anybody else can, but I can see you.  And also to our studio people back in Petaluma.  Little tiny cow town, Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chicken town isn't it?  I feel like, if I can make it here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll make it anywhere.  So and of course Jason Clanth is our producer  who's back in the studio.  Hi Jason, thank you for doing this.  We came out on vacation, Lisa and Michael and I,  our son Michael, and we thought,  well that'd be fun to see the place.  And this is really gonna be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so happy you came up here.  I know you're interrupting your vacation.  No, no, no, this is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is cool.  For you guys, anything.  And afterwards five napkin burgers.  Oh okay, all right.  Is that okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  I hear they have good hamburgers.  So tell me about the show that you're gonna do from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we have Annie Berman as our new producer,  she's done a great roundup  of some of the people we can talk to.  We're gonna do the same thing we're gonna do on Twitter  and talk about the news and talk about things  around New York, but as you pointed out,  you can't really go out from Petaluma  and interview a chicken.  We are in the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute, there's a big chicken texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh there it is, now you're right.  So we are in the center of the universe right here  and tech and media, tech and fashion,  startups, finance.  So we wanna go out and bring people in and talk  and I'm gonna try to take Gina's arm  and twist it behind her and get her to come in and host too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is only my first time here, this is not my last.  I'm very excited, I'm very excited to pitch in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While we can cover Silicon Valley pretty well  from our studios, it's really nice to have the East Coast  and New York.  You know, we were talking about Silicon Alley,  which I always thought was kind of a silly name  and I don't know if Jason Calacanis didn't start it  but he had the Silicon Alley reporter.  It almost felt like we're a little bit of like jealousy  of Silicon Valley.  Oh well we've got Silicon Alley.  Every town has a little Silicon Valley of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean locally you use it to refer to a particular area  of the city because there just isn't tech everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of Soho, kind of Chelsea area.  Kind of Flatiron more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, not far from here actually.  So yeah, but maybe it doesn't play as well kind of outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really, when was the last time you said either  Silicon Alley or Big Apple in New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true, I never say it, I sometimes see it.  Yes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mostly the tourist stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we're in Silicon Square,  Times Square, center of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think this is gonna be exciting.  Yeah, I'm really glad.  Well, there's some Google news we could talk about.  I think we should probably start with related,  but not Google news, which is of course the Apple news.  Apple's event on Monday.  At that time during the event,  we thought Apple was going to have to face  the Department of Justice the next day in court.  That the magistrate judge would be ruling  on the FBI's request that Apple help them unlock the phone.  Tim Cook obviously thought so,  and actually I thought made a very brief,  but very I think eloquent statement saying,  we never expect to be fighting our country,  but we feel it's our responsibility,  actually he said fighting our government,  we feel it's our responsibility to our customers  and our country as opposed to the government perhaps,  to stand up to the government and protect their security.  And I thought that was really kind of well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it played really well, people liked it,  and it was received well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and then shortly thereafter, later that evening,  the FBI goes to the judge says,  Your Honor, we don't need to have a hearing.  We think.  We're pulling back for now.  We'll defer this till April 5th.  Right.  We think we can hack it.  Somebody's stepped forward.  The latest news comes from Motherboard,  which has been doing really I think good tech coverage,  very good tech coverage lately.  They say that they believe it's an Israeli company,  well this comes from an Israeli newspaper called Celebrite,  which is an Israeli phone forensics firm.  Apparently while Celebrite executives,  this is from Haaretz,  the Celebrite executives would not comment.  They indicated they're confident  that a completely hack-proof phone has not been invented,  and they would eventually be able to unlock  any existing system on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they clearly must have demonstrated  they could do it in a similar situation to the FBI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the FBI's, you know, they're hedging their bets.  They said if they can't, we'll come back to you April 5th,  and we still will ask for this help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the interesting thing about that to me is  in the world of hacks of things,  the ethical thing to do is to reveal to the manufacturer  the hack that you used.  They're never gonna reveal to Apple what they used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times had an interesting article  talking about that, saying everybody,  Google, Facebook, everybody has a bounty.  If you find a bug, you could make as much as $100,000 bounty.  Apple has said, and I actually like Apple's principled stand  of what we're not gonna pay for those,  but as the Times points out,  maybe that's why companies like Celebrite  hold on to these zero days and say.  But I'm really asking another question, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the ethic in the developer community?  If you find a vulnerability, I believe the ethic  is you let the company know about it so they can close it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's definitely the culture.  Even in my very small open source projects,  like we had a very clear kind of policy.  Like if you find a security hole,  here's a private line that will get an immediate response from.  If we don't respond within a certain amount of time,  and this is just common practice,  then you can reveal it or take it.  But yeah, that's generally what you do.  But these folks are employed by the government, right?  I mean, we're gonna presume them.  Well, Celebrite is a private company.  If it's them, yes. Right, but I'm on contract.  Yeah, yeah, the government will then pay them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use their exploit, right?  But as a technologist.  Yeah, I hear you. So in other words,  they're making money from holding these exploits  instead of giving them to the company.  Is that ethical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not ethical.  I assume that they were employed  by the government previous to this.  Like that they're on contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they've been used before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's ethical, I'm just saying that.  I don't think that they were like,  Apple government, I'll go to government.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, in fact, it's quite the opposite.  Well, now the way that FBI suggested this  in their court filing was somebody has come to us  with a hack.  That's true.  Which would imply that somebody, if it's Celebrite,  would have said, oh, you know,  but they have worked with the government before.  They have exploits, in fact, on their web pages says,  we can crack iOS 8.  9 is a little bit more troubling, of course.  Yeah, 9 is just wrong.  But 8 also had encryption, full disk encryption.  So it sounds like Celebrite might have said,  hey, you know, called their contact  at the Department of Justice said, hey, we can crack it.  Why they didn't come forward sooner is another question.  My guess is because they had to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they didn't know, yeah.  They had, I'm guessing that anybody who wanted to do this  had to replicate the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not clear that they can do this, right?  They're testing this on phones that are in similar states  as the phones of the attackers, right?  Because they won't want to risk deleting data.  This is why they needed time, right?  So this is all kind of still uncertain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I really find it interesting  that the Justice Department did blink.  If they truly believed that they had the principle behind them,  they would have gone ahead in the case and said,  no, Apple, you just owe this to us  because we're the government and we're doing what's right.  Instead, they blinked as well.  If we don't need you, we won't ask you to do this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really interesting to me.  It is extraordinary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some legal authorities have suggested  that if you're going to use the all-RITs,  it is incumbent on you if you have another method.  You legally have to use that other method.  All-RITs can be used only if you know  there's no other way than to use the all-RITs.  That might explain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pay attention to me as a judge, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it does kind of give lie maybe to my assumption  that the government really wanted a wider precedent  than just this phone.  If really what they wanted was a wider precedent,  I mean, it would be unethical,  but they could have said, shh, celebrate.  Don't, we like this case.  This is a good one for us to go forward with.  There's also the possibility they may have gotten advice  from people.  The AC, I think it was the ACLU.  No, no, it was a Harvard professor pointed out  that the CALEA explicitly says that telephone companies  cannot be compelled to write software for the government  to let the government in.  They're protected by CALEA.  So it may have been that the FBI  and the Department of Justice at the 11th hour said,  you know, we're not gonna win this case.  Maybe Judge Pym.  We better let it go to lose.  Maybe Judge Pym said to them, you know, guys,  I'm gonna rule against you.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Maybe we'll know on April 5th if they go back to court,  but that's the latest on that.  And it's been endless fodder for us.  I think probably in some ways it's a little disappointing  that it's gone with a fizzle instead of a bang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what happens?  So say the hack works and they get into these phones.  I mean, at what point?  And then what happens?  Does Apple hire them to disclose the hack to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the ethical issue, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's a hack out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  It makes Apple look really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, what happens then?  And I presume the government puts them under NDA

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to the government.  Absolutely.  But now does Apple go off and try to hire other companies?  Apple, who won't pay for hacks,  hire other companies to try to replicate the hack  so they know what it is so they can close it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I have to think that Apple has lots of security companies  kind of already trying to, right?  I mean, but yeah, it's troubling.  This is the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple even says, you know, nothing is perfect.  There's no technology that doesn't have flaws or bugs  that might be used to exploit that technology.  And in fact, they said this in the Times article.  And that's why it's so important  that companies pay bug bounties  that they go to hackers, encourage hackers to say,  you know, tell us first before you release this publicly  so that we can fix it, because there is nothing perfect.  Right.  So it's maybe a foolish thing for Apple  to not offer these bug bounties,  but I think that it's also a principled thing.  I don't think they wanna pay.  It's like negotiating with terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But that presumes that the person who actually cracks it  is ill-intentioned.  If the intent is to say,  I'm trying to help you close vulnerabilities.  Well, but it's not-  That's not the-  I really like a job at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it celebrates business.  This is how they make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what they do.  They're a forensics company.  And often that's what it means is you use,  you look for zero days that will allow you  to do the forensics on the phone.  And that's their bread and butter.  That's their stock and trade.  They're not gonna tell Apple that.  They don't want it to be closed.  They'll have to come up with a new one.  So that's where the ethics, I'm kind of with you.  The ethics are a little sketch.  Yeah, I agree.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  When we come back, I do wanna talk a little bit  about Hulk Hogan because God knows who doesn't.  And yeah, we'll be playing that video a little later on.  No, we won't.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Lisa were here, she'd be saying,  no, we don't have the insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it newsworthy now?  Yeah.  So protected by the First Amendment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that was Conker's argument.  There was then, but we'll talk about that.  Well, it certainly is now.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying.  Let's not.  I'd like to eye-pop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a forbidden visual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't wanna see it either, to be honest with you.  And there is other things to talk about,  including I'm very upset with Google  for killing one more thing  that they say nobody uses, but I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm surprised you use it.  We'll talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll talk about that when we come back.  Our show today, not only brought to you  by the great folks at CUNY,  and we thank CUNY so much for the studio  and for the support, and we're really looking forward  to doing this with you guys.  This is gonna be fantastic. It's gonna be great.  But also by our friends at ZipRecruiter.  If you're hiring, you know that the internet's a boon  for this, right?  It means you can reach out to a much larger pool  of candidates.  In fact, I think it's safe to say  that the perfect person's out there somewhere.  Your job as a hire, as a recruiter, is to find them.  Well, how do you find them?  There's lots of job boards.  There's lots of social media.  What do you do?  What do you use?  Let me recommend ZipRecruiter.  So with ZipRecruiter, you post once  on the ZipRecruiter site.  They cross post to more than 100 job boards,  plus Twitter, plus Facebook, plus Craigslist,  LinkedIn, all the social media.  So you're getting to the widest possible audience,  really improving the chance of hitting that right person,  the one you really want to hire.  And you might say, well, I don't know if I wanna  reach out to a million people.  What if I get a million resumes?  No, that's good, because the resumes  don't come to your inbox.  The people don't call you on the phone.  They go into the ZipRecruiter interface,  where it's very easy for you to manage many, many applicants.  You can quickly screen them, rank them,  and hire the right person fast.  ZipRecruiter's got this down.  No wonder, I think it's like, last time I checked,  yeah, 800,000 businesses have used, 800,000.  Well, last time we talked, it was 400,000.  It's very popular, have used ZipRecruiter.  Plus, they also have, because if you go  to the ZipRecruiter site, you'll see  they also reach out to job hunters.  They have more than six million current resumes.  They're gonna match you to those right away.  That means within 24 hours, the applicants  are gonna start rolling in, and you're gonna  find that right person fast.  We got an email from Dan.  I think he heard about it on the show.  He's a happy ZipRecruiter client.  He says, the hardest part, there's a quote,  direct quote from the email.  The hardest part about running a business  when you need to hire is that you have  to spend extra time recruiting while you're short staffed.  But with ZipRecruiter, I've got quality candidates  within 24 hours of posting a job.  ZipRecruiter's website makes this process  so much faster by letting me manage  the candidates in one place.  I want you to try ZipRecruiter right now,  free for the first four days.  That's probably enough time for you to get that person.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig, T-W-I-G.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig, four days free.  Try it, really.  You'll do yourself a favor.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support  for this week in Google.  I like the Chrome app launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  So you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you feel about that?  I thought it was a little weird when they announced it.  It's only been around for a year or two.  The idea is if you've installed Chrome extensions,  and I do, I use a lot of Chrome.  Anybody who uses a Chromebook has a lot of Chrome extensions.  The app launcher then, and more than just on the Chromebook,  because this really is valuable on Windows and Mac,  it will put up an icon like it's an app.  And the apps will be there, and you can run them  as if they're standalone apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right.  So it's sticking around on Chrome OS, right?  They're only taking it away from Mac, Windows, and Linux.  Yeah, and they say that nobody used it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  except that I did use it.  You're a nobody.  So you absolutely need it on a Chromebook,  because that's when you press the search button.  That's what you're going to get.  It says all apps, and that's how you launch them.  What they're telling Mac, Windows, and Linux users is,  oh, no, you're going to have to go to the toolbar.  If you don't have an icon in the extensions,  you're going to have to go through the manual process  of going to more tools and extensions  and running it from there.  I don't think that's a very good experience.  Why would they kill it?  And my real point, I think, is Google does this too much.  And I think, Microsoft has done this a little bit too,  but they take a lot longer to give up on something.  I use this as an example.  Windows Media Center, which a lot of people use,  but they stopped developing in 2009,  and only just killed in Windows 10.  So for seven years, they didn't do anything to it,  but they figured, well, we're not going to kill it.  Google, it's kind of modern, right?  What is it Facebook says?  Move fast and break things.  Kill things fast.  But I think that hurts them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is kind of an example.  I mean, listen.  Wave.  Wave.  I was waiting for you to be cool enough  to bring that up again.  I know.  Listen, Google's a data-driven company.  If they're not seeing the use that they expect,  the critical mass of use, which has got to be a lot of use,  I mean, they killed Wave because it was like, well,  a million users, not so much.  I'd kill for a million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't they afford to keep these things going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can, but you know what?  Even a company like Google, why would you  expend resources on stuff that people just aren't clicking on  when not using?  I'll tell you why, because nobody trusts Google now.  Because they keep taking things away?  Yeah, you're going to be much less likely to go all in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on a Google.  So if they were to launch another Google Plus at this  point, I mean, I've been burnt twice.  Buzz, Google Plus, I'm not going to join in  in another Google Network.  Google Plus is still there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, we're talking about communities versus a little  utility in your toolbar.  You know what I mean?  And like, don't most, I mean, Leo, don't most of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it doesn't matter to them is what I'm saying,  is they don't care.  They'll kill anything.  Community, Wave, little toolbar utility, doesn't matter.  And that's very engineering driven.  That's very data driven.  That's very Google, right?  That's so Google of them.  Yes.  That would be a good show.  That's so Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google of you.  So Google of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But doesn't everyone just have a browser open always?  And if you need to go to an app, you go to it,  and the Apps button is right here,  and the Bookmarks toolbar right there.  That's basically the app launcher, right?  I guess, I mean, this page functions just as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I'm not saying, you're saying what Google's saying, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  I'm agreeing with Google on this.  I feel like if they don't have the users,  it doesn't make sense to support it.  I wouldn't feel that way if I loved and used the toolbar.  Which I do.  And that's the point is that, let's say it's only

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a million people.  But every time you do that, I think you hurt your brand.  And you show a lack of staying power  that, in the long run, means people  are going to be less likely to use your tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I read that killing Google readers  is what led to Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google reader was.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything's being blamed for Donald Trump.  It's all Donald Trump's fault.  Yeah, so Google reader is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google reader was particularly painful.  I'll agree there.  I'll get you.  So that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it, OK, so you don't care about this one.  Right.  But you might care about another one.  I just feel like it's a very, I guess,  what I would say to Mr. Google, if he ever asked me,  is launch fewer things and stick with them.  But Google's idea is let's launch a million things  and kill a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have no idea what people are going to like and use.  I mean, Gmail is a 20% project.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, right.  I mean, their big breakout hits.  Google News, 20%.  Yeah, news.  The thing I keep hearing about Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that it has just hordes of underemployed people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could keep a couple of guys working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they do is, so the underemployed person  invents something new, and then they kind of say, eh, man.  They kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is it just me?  I mean, maybe I'm the only one who feels this way.  I just feel like it's not, it sends a message that is not  necessarily good for Google.  They must be aware of this.  They're smart guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if they maintained everything  that they ever launched and didn't do so well,  we'd still have no.  No.  No, I agree.  So that's what I'm saying is maybe do some.  We'd have Wave, even Wave.  I'll concede.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do more internal testing, launch fewer things maybe.  Right.  Right.  Maybe that's why they always say beta, beta, beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's what's open.  Somebody wrote a book about this.  That's what's open about it.  That's what makes them generous, and that's  what gives us the in on helping tell them  what products ought to be.  And if we tell them, nah, we don't care,  then they listen to that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just impossible to predict what people  are going to love and use.  What are the things that people.  I guess I understand that.  If it was easier to predict, they'd  be a lot more successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, they've got to do something  about Google+.  I should post this image.  I.  Uh-oh.  I.  Well, so Google plus is still good.  I mean, I still follow people there.  There's some good people there posting a lot of stuff.  Mike Elgin, now that he's back on the road, he's in Cuba.  He's posting there all the time, and it's great.  I love it.  In fact, I've been reading more Google plus because of Mike's  posts there.  But I'm going along, and they have a thing called hot topics  that you don't control.  And I've mentioned this before.  You don't control what's in hot topics.  It's just them intruding into your stream.  And in this case, it was literally,  it was an anti-Semitic rant.  Yo.  And it had, and I looked, and I screen shot it,  so I'll have to post it on Google+.  It had like three plus ones.  It had two comments.  And they said trending topic.  There's nothing trending about it.  And this has happened to me a number of times.  We're really kind of, it doesn't agree with my politics,  but even, but I mean, anti-Semitism  is more than just not agreeing with my politics.  Fringey stuff.  No.  That I don't understand why Google's surfacing it  if it had 100 pluses maybe, but it didn't.  They also have less data now.  Maybe that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have something tuned to a lot of people using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because this guy posted?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One post, hey, it's hot.  I'm getting very few people.  I mean, there's like four people I see now  on Google Plus feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a way to kill it faster and faster, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look, there's an app launcher on Google+.  That might be a reason to stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, now I'm liking it.  Wow.  That's good.  Sorry, just kidding.  Just teasing.  This is somebody I can't uncircle  because I never circled them.  I can't get rid of it.  It's stuck into my feed.  I mean, it's not, I'm not a little shrinking violet.  I can see it and it's not going to poison me,  but I don't want to see it.  I don't know.  All right, enough of that.  That's my personal problem.  I'm happy today.  There should be a regular segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo's Kvetch.  No, that's your segment.  You already own that segment.  No, I rant you Kvetch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  What are you going to do, Gina?  I don't know what I'm going to do.  She kvells.  You're going to hug.  She's going to hug.  She's a hugger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that we're in New York,  we're going to do the show in New York.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A hugger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what everybody is afraid of.  That's exactly, we got New York values.  I can see that.  Yeah.  That's the dog whistle, isn't it?  Oh, it's New York values.  We know what that means.  Yeah, we know what that means.  Renaming Chromecast to Googlecast.  What does that mean?  Why?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Googlecast was the name of the protocol.  I thought that it was like the technology  behind the Chromecast.  So now they're just sort of merging them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to google.com slash cast.  It's just the cast.  It says meet Googlecast as if we haven't met that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As if we haven't met, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may be though they want to get beyond the little dongles  to something larger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Nealey wrote a really interesting piece  about Vizio TVs and getting rid of the remote,  oddly replacing it with an Android tablet.  But the argument is that you just cast  whatever you're watching.  And so maybe they're, in his argument,  they're trying to, with Vizio,  they're really reinventing the notion  and the experience of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it that Vizio is acknowledging  that maybe they're not the best software developers  in the world.  Actually, Vizio's smart TVs are better than Samsung's,  which are really different.  They are, they're great.  Yeah, the Vizios aren't bad.  And maybe that's why they want to make them even better.  But requiring that somebody own an expensive.  No, they sell you with the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes with it.  That is just Android.  I think it's Lollipop.  But.  That's interesting.  But it's, so it's not just a remote.  So you don't get a remote with a new Vizio TV.  You get this instead.  And what I don't know is can I use my phone instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we should mention, this is the P series,  which is they're horrendously expensive,  high-end TVs.  They only make two models.  There's, I think, a 70 and 120 inch.  And the big one is like over 100 grand.  It's like you buy a Tesla and you get a tablet with it.  Exactly.  So yeah, so that maybe isn't something  that they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but I think what it says is.  And by the way, you do get a regular remote

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as well as a tablet.  Oh, you do?  Oh, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it says that you could be using your phone  truly as a remote.  Well, that's what I do with Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, I think that's what's great about Chromecast.  I think that's what they're saying.  Is you pick the app.  Google Cast, Leo, Google Cast.  What is it?  Google Cast.  I guess it makes sense to take the word Chrome out of it.  Because it has nothing to do with the browser at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jake was saying to me earlier, it has nothing to do with Chrome.  Did you bring a Happy Meal?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This looks like a Happy Meal.  Oh, it says the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.  You have your own cardboard.  Isn't that cool?  What are you going to do with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we can watch more later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, seriously.  I heard about that.  It was serious.  I don't know.  So why is CUNY doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're getting big into VR.  VR journalism.  One of our web video geniuses, Ron Sascha,  is really learning a lot about it.  I think that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York Times did that, right?  They distributed those with the Sunday Times a few months ago.  Cardboard is funny, because it feels like the poor stepchild  of Google's, I mean, to Samsung's Gear VR,  and then Oculus Rift, which is $700, and Vibe, which is $800.  And this is $0.59.  But it actually works fine.  It works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the most accessible VR there is out there.  You have a phone and a piece of cardboard,  and you get to try this out.  It's a good gateway to VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, good on you.  The needs of journalism in VR are very different,  because for one thing, there's no fourth wall.  So the journalist or the camera operator is in the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the controversy with the New York Times.  No, the journalist steps out of the story,  so the journalist is setting up the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're saying to the subject, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Start packing your lunch in a minute, and then disappears.  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one thing I would suggest to my colleague Bob,  I would suggest that we should do kind of a how-to of how is it  made so you see what happens.  And then how to do it ethically as opposed to staging.  It even starts here, Leo.  I think we've gotten a bunch of the Fetas, which  you used on your cruise on the movie.  Yeah, I have it with me, actually.  And I think there's the opportunity there for journalists  to start thinking in 360.  I agree.  In immersion.  Somebody else just did a 360 of an interview with somebody.  That makes no sense to me.  What, we're going to look behind me  when there's nobody talking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No, it's about place.  It's about space.  Yeah.  Right.  So that's where I use it.  I use it on a cruise ship.  I was thinking about using it.  We went down.  It was very moving, by the way, to the 9-11 museum and memorial.  And I was thinking, I was going to use the Feta there,  but then I actually thought better of it.  It seemed inappropriate.  But that's the kind of place where-  Did you take pictures there?  Did people take pictures there?  Yeah.  So there's a part of the museum that you can take pictures of.  And there's amazing stuff.  The last pillar.  When they were cleaning out the rubble,  they left one steel beam there to the very, very end.  And people were covering it with names and memorials.  And then with great honor, at the very end,  they took it down and they escorted it out.  And they were saluting.  It's quite moving.  They have pictures of it.  They're saluting as it goes.  And then, of course, they built a beautiful memorial.  I know you guys both-  Have you gone?  No, I can't do it.  I haven't been able to do it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do it.  It's too emotional?  Yeah.  Leo's saying to me that I shouldn't.  You can do it.  It'd be cathartic.  We should.  Here it is 15 years later.  Yeah, it's been a while.  I would like to go to One World Trade  and do the elevator ride I hear is amazing.  I heard that's amazing.  No.  Oh.  Maybe not, Jeff.  I'm not doing that.  I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's one of the most beautiful and appropriate  memorials I've ever seen.  It's very difficult.  Imagine.  How do you do a memorial?  And there was, I'm sure, a lot of debate about, do we rebuild?  What do we do with this site?  And I think they did exactly the right thing, which is they  didn't rebuild on the site.  They built next to it this beautiful building.  Right.  What is it?  One World Trade Center now?  I said what it's called.  One World Trade, is that?  But where the bases of one and two were is a kind of a,  there's a hole in the ground, and then there's a waterfall  with a second hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The footprints.  I've seen drawings on that.  It is so moving.  I've gone to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then all the way around it, the names.  And in many places, I wanted to take a picture.  Again, I just didn't want to intrude, so I felt I didn't do it.  But there are roses and flags and memorials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time I'm walking by, I'm like, can I do this right now?  No, no, no, I'll do it later.  Well, I understand.  It's very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in that shot, if you're watching video,  at the top of it is the new building.  And then the two squares below that are, this is Google Earth,  are the memorials.  And they're really very touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My response is, so the first time I went,  they had huge security.  It was worse than going to an airport to get in.  Now it's open.  But then it was very closed.  And that was disturbing.  What has happened to us?  And I had an odd reaction.  This will be controversial, but after the first time,  I actually think that it's too big, that it leaves  the scar forever in the city.  And life goes on, and things get built upon things.  Look at ancient cities.  And for this to forever be hallowed ground,  it's like I don't really understand the,  I'm not criticizing for a second,  but putting a memorial on the highway where someone died,  that would be the last place I'd want a memorial to be.  Where you died.  Yeah, yeah, and do it somewhere else.  I mean, I get it, I understand it,  but it's just not what I see.  So what we did was we said, this is hallowed  because people died there.  Well, yes, but they've died all over the city  in various ways.  And you can't lock off everything  that had tragedy associated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were walking by City Hall, and of course,  that was a notorious British prison camp  during the revolution, where many more people died  and suffered for years.  And now it's a park, and it's not a memorial at all.  In fact, I only knew that because of Foursquare.  I was gonna say, boy, your history is brilliant.  I checked in and it said, did you know  that you're on the site?  And actually, that was a very neat use of Foursquare.  Foursquare is fantastic in New York City.  I was really pleased.  I learned something.  So I don't agree with you.  I understand, I actually don't disagree with you.  And you have more standing to say that.  Yeah, I'm not saying that I'm staying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I do, it was an emotional reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can understand that completely.  Totally legitimate.  And yet it is a beautiful memorial.  And I think we need memorials in all sorts of places.  And it's a beautiful, it's a really touching memorial.  And then next to it is the museum,  which I had seen the memorial before,  but I hadn't seen the museum.  And I know you guys haven't.  And that is something you will have to gird yourself for  because it is very heart-wrenching.  And there's tissues everywhere and people needed them.  I knew them.  So you can take pictures of parts,  and I did take some pictures.  But then you go into an exhibit  where you're not allowed to take pictures.  And that's where there's sound and video and pictures.  And it brings it all rushing back.  So don't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you could block off a couple days for that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe it's time, it's been a long time.  Yeah, it has been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, on the morning of the,  I was riding the PATH train,  which is where I was on the morning of 9-11.  And I was riding it on the morning of the Belgium attacks.  And it just kind of brought it back.  Yeah, I had flashbacks.  To just seeing the faces on the PATH train that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I have the same reaction to 9-11  and to this Belgian incident.  I just don't understand people and why they do that.  I understand the anger  that people feel as we bomb them with, you know.  However, these were rangers.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're taking innocent lives.  I mean, I understand the anger,  but I think we just need to stop all of this.  And maybe truce and we can figure it out  because it's just, it's so sad.  I fear we'll go the opposite way, though.  Yeah, I think you might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I come to New York and you just held a ball.  Yeah, it's really-  Well, it's the first thing I did.  I wanted to do that.  I'm a real joyful here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually do that a lot.  Yeah, I paid for it.  Did you pay for it?  No, you did.  Almost every time I've come to New York,  I've actually gone to the grounds.  Really?  Yeah, the first time I came was a month after 9-11.  And I went there and of course it was still, you know,  it was all chain link fence and plastered morgues.  And even where, have you seen my husband?  Have you seen my son?  I remember those shows.  So I have a very strong connection to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you were worried today,  there is a smell to the city.  Yeah, you can't.  You can't forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then they built a beached whale next to it, which is,  now that I think they could have stopped.  Beached dead whale.  I thought the Oculus was gonna be beautiful,  but then you get to the scene  and you have this beautiful touching memorial  and there's whale bones.  There's a, what is that, the path station?  Path station, yeah.  It is, okay, I'm sure it's, I'm not an architectural critic.  There it is, going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's Jonah. I haven't seen it before.  We walk in, you're Jonah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's huge.  how big that is.  It's giant.  It takes over the site.  It's like a whale died there and it's beached bones.  It's bleached bones are still there.  It's, I don't get it, but I'm not an architectural critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was going to, in the original consumption,  I think it was going to open up to the air and close.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like it has levers or levers.  It doesn't really open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  That cost more money.  It cost enough as was.  Welcome back to this week in architectural criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, we're moving along here.  We've, how about Tesla using Google Glass  to help build, speaking of Tesla,  to help build cars in this factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad if anyone could find a use for that damn thing,  it's Tesla.  It's Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it won't be Google Glass.  It won't be.  Well, it's going to be from a company called Vuzix.  They're using Glass and Vuzix at the Fremont factory.  They're comparing the platforms,  so there will be a winner at some point.  But it makes sense.  I mean, you think of Tesla as being built by robots,  but they're humans.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is a legitimate use case for glass-like technology.  I think so.  Right, surgeons and specialized work like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would think it'd be more useful, though,  in repair than in assembly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Assembly, you know what you're doing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a task to do it.  Yeah, right.  Flip the widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is actually, apparently, a picture of a Tesla  being made, I think you had that, nine to five Google,  from glass.  That's a picture of a glass,  and you see the VIN number in the glass,  and you see details, start repair, get help.  It's very interesting.  Very interesting.  Gadget Hog in our chat room says that that design  is very typical of the architect, Calatrava, who did it.  Yes, it is.  He does that kind of thing.  So they get-  As controversial as he is.  They knew what they were getting.  And the BCE Center in Toronto is built by him.  That was, yeah, that has that, it's not whale bones,  but it has that same kind of curvy shape.  Interesting.  Moving along here, Google Glass.  Albums in photos are smarter.  I just, you know, I love photos.  I just, so behind the scenes, we took pictures of this set  and stuff right before we started.  I copied the pictures to my lovely Galaxy S7.  Very nice.  It's a very nice photo.  That's a good one.  So now it's a Google, it's in Google Photos.  Thank you to Jake, your son,  for taking those pictures, by the way.  And I'm gonna share them off to the studio,  Another great use.  I tell you, you have Google Photos.  Look at that, I can just share these as a shared album.  These albums are getting smarter.  You can add maps, locations, and captions as well.  So a new shared album.  I'm gonna create a link,  and then I'm gonna share it with email, with Jerry.  Jerry, you're gonna get pictures in the email.  Let's see it, we'll do it in real time, see how it works.  What else?  Google asked 1,000, go ahead, you take this one.  Yeah, take that one, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanna hear your reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google asked 1,000 British teenagers  whether they wanted to start a startup,  and I think not many said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, here.  Most of them said, no, no, what are you talking about?  Only 22 of them said.  Of the 1,000.  I don't wanna start a startup.  What did they wanna do?  Oh, 22%, well that's not so bad.  That's not so bad, actually.  Better than 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because if everyone wanted to start a startup,  then there'd be no way to hire or just start your startup.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is interesting, though, that these kids are like,  I'm gonna be responsible and get a job  at a stable company and not be so reckless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what, Gina?  It is a little scary.  Even though you're still but a pup,  how would you have felt about doing the startup  you're doing now when you were 22 years old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I would not have done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a lot of my entrepreneurial students go get jobs.  They learn the business.  I think that's appropriate.  They go get jobs, but they still have the bug.  The virus won't leave them.  So it's like Zika.  And they then go start their company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's true.  That's true.  I always kind of consider myself a late bloomer  and became more risk tolerant and more confident  as I get older, which I don't know what that was about.  In college, I would have never thought about.  Although, when I talk to my nephews,  I'm like, have you thought about maybe starting a business?  There's employers and employees kids.  You wanna be an employer.  I gotta give them my whole speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it possible that some kids will do it just defensively  because they can't get jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  I think that's, a lot of it.  I think young people are feeling afraid  of not being able to get jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many of you in the chat room  would like to do a startup right now  instead of getting a job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Says P shops, being an entrepreneur  isn't the be all and end all of work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, it's a crappy job.  Don't do it.  Yeah, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough, you guys.  Doctor Mom wants to do a 62.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doctor Mom, we're about the same age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  No, it's hard.  Starting companies very, very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yogi wants to, Slow Mo wants to.  Part of it is the knowledge that most startups fail.  Yes.  If you asked a thousand British teenagers  if they wanted to start a restaurant,  they'd probably say no too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reality is that most people who start companies  have a safety net.  They've got family.  They've got, they're healthy.  They're in a good position.  They have connections.  I mean, I don't know how many times,  I've talked to investors and they've said,  little friends and family money.  And I was kind of like, who do you think my family is?  My mom was a public school teacher.  What friends and family money?  So there's that.  There's that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that most entrepreneurs  come from wealthy backgrounds  or come from poor backgrounds?  I feel like people like Jason Calacanis  was driven to being an entrepreneur, right?  He's a special psychological kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Calacanis and I have actually debated about this  because he's got this perception of himself  as being this like, Yeah, this scrappy kid  who grew up in Brooklyn.  Yeah, he grew up like a couple blocks away from me  in a very middle-class neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Like, and he went to the Catholic high school,  just like I did.  Like, we were not, I was not,  I was very, very middle, not poor.  Middle-class.  Middle-class, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Donald Trump thinks he was, you know,  started under rough circumstances.  He only got a million dollars alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, self-perception is a powerful thing.  Sorry, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dr. Mom says most come from a background  where they're willing to take risks,  whatever the economic background.  That may be true, although-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you absolutely have to be risk-telling,  but there have been studies that are showing that  most people who are, most entrepreneurs  have some sort of safety net, right?  I mean-  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  I kept the radio job, I still haven't quit it,  because I don't know if this Twitter thing  is going to work out.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, last week I couldn't be on the show  because I was at CBIT giving a talk.  By the way, how'd that go?  CBIT's strange, because why, CBIT used to be the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the biggest conference in the world, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Well, because they lost all the gadgets to mobile world.  Right. Right.  And who buys PCs and all that kind of gadgets anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's become like Comdex, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's all big iron and stuff like that,  but then what matters there now?  The cloud.  How do you show the cloud?  It's very abstract.  Amazon came with a big blow-up cloud,  and you go inside and there they had a few desks.  Right.  Let's not let it show.  It's virtual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all back there in Armok, so just imagine, if you will,  a bunch of servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So with the European, part of the reason they had me over  was to beat them up about starting companies.  And the one thing I do say is that, in the US,  we have at least five times the venture investment of Europe.  Some investments, 10 times, but call it five times.  You're not going to get at Google if you don't invest.  And you've got to have risk.  The paradox here is, the irony here, I think,  is that in Europe they do have safety nets.  Yes.  Not that you could live on them entirely,  but you can have health insurance.  You can leave your job.  You can do other things.  Your kids can go to college.  But there's a risk aversion, especially in Germany,  but in Europe.  And I say at the same time, I think we've fetishized risk  in the US.  I think when we put a badge on you and say, oh, you failed,  it could be because you had a really crappy idea  and you did it badly.  And maybe you should have failed  and you shouldn't try it anymore.  This is the lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes failure is deserved.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's not the way we treat it in the US.  No.  Yeah, that's always been the truism about Europe  is that their failure keeps them from having  this entrepreneurial spirit.  And they'll say it to me.  This VC spirit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I can make unfair generalizations about Europe,  but that's not one of them because they'll agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think on the other hand, we have fetishized the pull  yourself up by arm bootstrap story here,  that everybody can make it here and the streets are  paved with gold.  And the app economy is just another form of that fairy  tale where, well, anybody can write an app.  And thanks to Google Code Engine or Amazon Web Services,  anybody can create a startup.  And it is easier than it ever was,  but I think it's also harder because everybody's doing it.  It's harder to succeed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody can have a candy crush, but they can't.  Right.  Right.  No, they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  The app store is definitely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So while we're just talking about app stores,  TechCrunch did a piece this week arguing  that the reported Facebook Messenger bot store  that they suppose they're going to announce at F8  is going to be as big as the app store.  What do you think about bigger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what I would say.  Well, certainly what everybody's looking for is the next.  We've got commitment here.  Look at, who was it?  Quartz did an app that was a news app,  but it really wasn't a news app.  It was a bot, wasn't it?  It was clearly a test case for how would news  be delivered in a messaging context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my very proud graduates in the entrepreneurial program  has a very hot company out there now called Purple, which  talks to you about the election in SMS.  So here's the-  So it's a conversational interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, a conversational interface for news and information.  I can tell you how we got here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's clear that the new platform, the new screen,  is not the desktop, the laptop, the tablet.  It's the phone, right?  That's, if you're simply looking at hours of interaction,  that's where all the interaction happens.  The device formerly known as a phone.  Yes, this screen you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that people used to talk on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As Bruce Sterling calls it, our glass lozenge.  So if you want to get a piece of that,  it's about attention on the glass screen, right?  And the first thing was, well, you  want to be the app on the front page.  That was all about that.  For the first couple of years, it was all about that.  Not so much soon anymore.  Next thing was notifications.  Everybody's hot on notifications.  In fact, look what Facebook did.  That's one of the reasons Facebook split off  messengers to double the number of notifications.  Because how do people interact?  They swipe down or they- I can't remember  what you do on an iPhone, but you look at your notifications.  It's been so long, a whole week.  But you look at your notifications, swipe down.  That's another way to get that screen attention.  But ultimately, what is the thing  that gets your attention most often?  What do you think you interact with most often  on your lozenge is messaging?  Direct messages from friends.  So you're in Messenger all the time.  But what's going to happen is, and we're already seeing this  with products like Slack, I think.  Yep, I was going to say that.  Is the new inbox.  It's as bad as your email was.  Because messaging was only great because no one used,  you know, it was just close friends and family.  But once everybody, once Quartz is in there  and your delivery service is in,  once everybody's messaging you, it's worse.  Well, it's not just messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it replace Google, to some extent?  Because you can ask questions and get more direct answers  from a smarter machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what Google thinks.  They think that search is going to messaging, right?  Right.  And the only reason I think I have some insight  is because I really went all in on Telegram,  which I really liked.  And Telegram has had bots for a while.  I even have a bot myself.  So you could just.  There's a Leo bot?  There's a Leo bot.  What does it do?  Chief Twitbot, well, I'll show you.  It does all sorts of things.  Tell them what you think the Leo bot does.  It's called the Mechanical Leo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a Kvetch mode?  There should be.  There's going to be a Kvetch mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the last four posts were when I put an audio show up,  you get a notification.  Leo's posted a new audio show.  I do it for audio, not for video,  because I figure, well, you'll click that,  you'll listen, and you'll continue on.  I've also tied it to my car.  So when I pull up in front of the studio,  there's a message, Leo pulled up, let's go live.  So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, this is like push RSS feed.  It's like, yes, it's RSS.  It's really old.  Does it sound familiar?  It's like friend feed.  It's friend feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, right.  When I blog, when I post on Instagram,  it all goes into this Mechanical Leo.  Now, I would have thought that's,  I was just playing with it to learn the platform.  Right.  Thousands of people subscribe to this.  Really?  I can't remember the number,  but it's over a thousand people.  What?  So that to me was kind of an eye-opener.  Oh, okay.  But my instinct is that this is gonna have  the same problem Slack has,  which is it's going to be an inbox  without any of the good controls  that you have in email, filters and all that stuff.  It's just gonna become jammed.  Here's a Sysbot.  I can order flowers.  I can get a ride, food delivery.  This is a chatbot.  Food, restaurant reservations,  hire a courier, discover places, event tickets,  book hotels, get haircut, and you do it by messaging.  The inspiration for this, of course,  is WeChat in China, where that's what people do.  And I think that that might have had more success.  I'm not sure why that had more success in China.  Possibly because they were using  less powerful devices, maybe.  So messaging is certainly easier to write a messenger bot  than it is to write an app.  It's trivial.  Right, with first-hand vacations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a messenger bot, yes,  but an intelligent bot you can query, no,  and a bot that can anticipate your needs  and let you know of something.  Right, remember, a true alert.  Right, what do I get on my alerts all the time?  So I have this brilliant colleague here at CUNY  named Carrie Brown, who heads our social journalism.  And it's very social.  So on Facebook, where you can say,  hey, put this person on the top,  and I'll always show you the top.  Well, she's constantly buzzing me, right?  Right!  Right, or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, watches now  make this even more valuable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook constantly tells me,  you have new interactions.  Well, really?  Really, I have new interactions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  First thing I do is turn off notifications in email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's some notifications I actually want.  So a notification system,  we've talked about this years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Notifications are better than messaging, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and one that anticipates your needs.  Right.  That is the hyper-level news stream,  as Marissa Mayer said back in the day.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But correct me if I'm wrong,  haven't we seen this kind of search for years?  I mean, I feel like AOL Messenger had searched in it.  Right, searched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?  Well, there was a company that was old,  friends of mine started, called Smarter Child,  way back in the day that was on AOL.  You could ask questions and you could go in.  So exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So everything old is new again,  or everything new is old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's new here is the idea  that I'm interacting with another being, right?  Like that I'm having a conversation,  versus like Google Now, right?  Which does a lot of stories tailored to you,  and really can anticipate what you want  without you having to query,  because you've already queried, you searched, right?  You did a Google search.  But it seems like the thing here is like,  I'm gonna interact with this thing,  versus get these sort of solace,  or these push notifications from apps  that are just like you, three new messages,  or here's something you might like today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is an area that I think I would love to see Google  try lots of new ideas in.  I think that's what Now was about, was the card interface.  And I think Now on Tap is another way  of kind of experimenting with,  well, how do people wanna interact with information,  how they want information to arrive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is there a green light coming up  from behind your watch, under your wrist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably it means my heart is beating in an unusual.  That's behind.  Yeah, well, it's gotta go through my blood, right?  That's how it's checking out.  So I'm 69 beats a minute, I'm very calm.  Oh, I see, okay.  Very calm.  New York.  You're in New York.  You know, New York relaxes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Times Square, very chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So chill.  God, two in the morning, they've got characters out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know, but I just love  that your advice is don't hug the Elmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell the students that don't hug the Elmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cannot bring my toddler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, they're not the cleanest looking Elmos anyway.  They get hugged a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and then they can make money in the tips.  Oh, I know, no wonder.  It's a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The poor tour's, the kids says, Elmo, Elmo!  Oh, the kids hug Elmo.  Yeah, and they take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then of course there's the day-nooters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I didn't see any of those at two in the morning.  A little cold, a little cold.  Yeah, it's a chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw Batman, though.  Oh yeah?  Oh yeah, did you see the naked cowboy?  He's been there for years.  He's still laughing.  He's still laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got competition now, though.  There's other naked.  He's got naked cowgirl, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's, by the way, they're not naked.  They're wearing underpants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  And tidy whiteys, it's not very naked.  They're tidy whiteys, ick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sad to see, this is another thing  Google's giving up on, robotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see, they're selling,  they want to sell Boston Dynamics.  I don't, I'm not sure why,  but the impression I'm getting from reading these articles  is it's a, well, this is what Brad Stone called it,  a retreat from robotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm confused.  I thought this was on a moonshot, right?  It seems like they're saying, well, this company doesn't.  Well, Andy Rubin left.  Do you think that's how, part of it?  It sounds like there were definitely some politics.  Andy Rubin left.  They struggled with leadership.  The Boston Dynamics wasn't interacting  with Google's other divisions.  This sounds like this was a human problem,  versus, and they're saying that this company  didn't have revenue within the next three to five years.  What is Google Care?  What is Google Care?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were doing amazing things.  I heard something, the video of the guy being mean  to the robot was their last ditch effort  to prove to Google how cool they were, was in theory.  That was a mistake.  Well, I mean, the video's just done amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google seemed concerned about the PR issues  around people getting upset  that robots are going to take over, good jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the truth is, one of the primary revenue streams  for robotics is going to be military and police.  And Google did pull back from that,  but then you're hampering the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Boston Dynamics did have military contracts.  Google said when they acquired them,  well, we're going to let those lapse,  but apparently they didn't or weren't able to.  Brad writes in Bloomberg Business,  tensions between Boston Dynamics and Google  partly was because they didn't want to work with Google.  They were reluctant to work with Google's  other robot engineers.  Now, it's not clear if those engineers were robots  or they were real people working on engineers.  So Brad, again, when you're writing about robots,  it's very important to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to say, I imagine the Android statues  out on Google's campus kind of like having it out  with the robot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also part of the problem was, as you said,  that there was no clear path to monetization.  I mean, what- I just didn't realize

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that was a concern for the other alphabet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems strange to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does, it did to me too.  Jonathan Rosenberg, who is an advisor to Larry Page  and a former Google senior vice president,  said in a meeting,  time frame that we need to be generating  an amount of revenue that covers expenses.  And that needs to be in a few years.  It does seem like an unusually non-Googley thing to ask for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Alphabet is running these companies within it  as startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to think some of this also comes from,  and this was the Speculation Sunday on Twitter,  a reluctance.  When you look at these videos,  I think there might be some people at Google that said,  do we really want people to associate us  with kind of killer robots?  Is that really-  No.  That's maybe not the right message to be saying right now.  And people who are mean to robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and make you sympathetic with a robot.  It's all a screwed up world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're already struggling with trust, you guys.  Let's not make this worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That actually rings a little bit true.  I mean, they've got to be a little bit aware of that.  But isn't a self-driving car a robot?  There is.  Yes.  And that's the problem  is that Google has other robotics divisions.  Yes.  We're getting some blips every few seconds  on the stream apparently.  I'm hearing from our people back there.  I'm afraid of that.  Is it possible for us to dial down the quality  to improve the stream?  Is that, can that help?  Can we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do we think guys?  They're gonna do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you.  So yeah, quality is not quite as important.  Because we're recording here, we can send you the-  Yeah, but also the most important thing  is audio quality.  Video is secondary and continuous.  Audio is probably the primary-  I saw it coming on.  I thought that was just on-  Piece of importance.  Yeah, we actually, Jason,  have a feedback of the stream here.  So continuing on.  What do you think guys?  Actually, let me, you look,  see what you wanna talk about next.  You haven't installed in yet.  Yeah, I did on my other phone.  Oh, okay.  Nut roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Android Nut Roll.  I finally got a use for my old Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is your secondary phone.  Okay, I was gonna say.  But I'm surprised you didn't put it on your Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, because it's a little-  It's early.  I see.  I haven't had any problems with it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have it on my Pixel and my SXP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put it on, I put Fi on the phone too.  And so when I went to Europe last week-  Yeah, how'd that work out?  Pretty well.  Because I'm on AT&T Unlimited,  I can't use this as a hotspot.  Right.  So I could do that in Europe.  Right, and slow, very slow.  Well, no, it would come in at 3G sometimes.  I mean, 4G sometimes.  Really?  Yeah, I'll be-  For free?  Yeah, well, for the data charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, that's right.  Okay, so with T-Mobile, it's free free.  Free free?  Yeah.  It might count against your data cap.  That's, oh, okay.  But at that speed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like at some point it gets through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that's weird about Google Fi  is you pay as you go,  so you don't get a bundle of bits to begin with.  Right, right.  It works fairly well.  Good.  We'll talk a little more about Nutjob in a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the one I-  Saphir.  Even though it isn't really the most PC language.  That'd be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nutrolls.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nutroll's my favorite.  Nougat, Nutella, everybody thinks it's gonna be Nutella.  I don't know.  Nah.  It's a brand name, right?  Yeah, they're not gonna do a brand name.  I feel terrible about this.  I did not bring the snacks.  And now I have to do a Nature Box ad.  And now we're all gonna suffer.  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should have brought some of your homes  since you sent me the nice stuff to send them to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Android Nature Box.  I bet they'd make a deal.  I bet they'd make a deal.  Yeah, there you go.  Nature Box, back at the studio, we got Nature Box.  I can't remember how many boxes a month,  we get like five or six.  Because the staff loves them.  Nature Box sells snacks.  They deliver them in a box to you monthly.  Snacks you want without wasting time  and without going to the machine,  which is about what Jeff's about to do.  Go to the machine and get a stale candy bar.  Do not.  They're bad for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Greasy, oily, salty.  Trans fats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Nature Box, they have all kinds.  They have sweet, savory, spicy.  You get to choose.  There's more than 100 snacks to choose from.  There's vegan, there's no sugar added.  There's non-GMO.  Some of my favorites.  I love the Asiago and cheddar cheese crisps.  See, I don't want to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want the dried pineapple right now.  Yeah, that's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really a happy box.  It's a happy box.  The happy box has arrived at my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nature Box is a happy box.  This is a new one.  I haven't tried the guacamole bites.  Is there avocado in them?  Ooh.  Super easy.  You fill out your snack profile,  you get personalized recommendations.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Your snack profile.  I have a snack profile.  Is this everything?  Well, you might say I want more salty than spicy  or more sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they gonna have a messenger bot that I can ask for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that would be nice.  Interact with your nature bot.  I want to share my snack profile on Facebook.  I want a nature bot.  They don't, look, you shouldn't eat anything you don't like.  If you get a snack,  and yeah, because they want you to experiment,  and you say, well, you know, I'm not a jalapeno guy.  No problem.  They'll replace it in your next box for free.  So it's just great all around.  Naturebox.com slash twit,  and we're gonna get you 50% off your first box  of delicious and unique snacks without any of the junk.  50% off naturebox.com slash twit.  What was I thinking?  Why did I not bring a nature box with me?  I know, sure.  Oh.  Man.  Android N has a free form window mode.  At least I've been reading about it.  I haven't been able to make it happen,  kind of like a computer,  like with Windows floating and stuff like that.  Article by Ron Amadio in Ars Technica,  he says it's in the code, in the developer documents,  but apparently there's a way to do it.  So I don't, do you have your N with you?  Hey, Jake, can you go get me the other phone from my office?  This, to me, this is about the Pixel C,  because then you have a desktop operating system, right?  Even better than a Chromebook.  The mode has to be enabled.  Once it's enabled, you'll see an extra button  on the thumbnails in the recent apps screen.  So you hit the thumbnail button,  you get the recent apps.  To the left of the X button  that pops up after a second or two,  this is Ron says this,  there'll be a square shape,  and that will be, you press the square symbol  and you'll be whisked away to a screen  showing that app in a floating window  on top of your paper.  But the windows aren't floating above the Android desktop.  The background is blank wallpaper  without any of your icons or widgets.  So it isn't exactly like Windows.  You're just in a floating app world.  And you can drag the apps around  and they have close and minimize.  You can resize the window.  Apps will auto switch between tablet and phone layouts  depending on the size of the screen.  That's one of the things  Android has a real advantage with.  You're an Android developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm gonna be contrarian though.  I don't want this.  You don't want this?  I don't want this.  Well, not for my phone.  So this won't be enabled for the phone.  For a tablet anymore?  I mean, maybe for a tablet.  I like that Android is kind of single tasking.  I don't want it using up cycles or battery  to do this kind of thing.  This is a computer mode for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On a tablet though, this would be awesome, wouldn't it?  I guess.  I don't know.  It works with a mouse even.  You can even plug a mouse in.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Well, you don't have to turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well that's fair.  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to get my key.  Oh, so he's gonna be back.  He's gonna come back.  We may never see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I need to get my key.  All right, here he comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the split screen mode as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I use the split screen mode already.  And on the Pixel C, it actually really,  I mean, okay, I don't use it for anything,  but I could use it.  You know what?  Actually, I'm coming around to your way of thinking.  Even though I have this capability,  what am I gonna do?  Have YouTube open and then the chat room?  Well, no, here's where I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, here's where I-  A little screen and screen thing.  Picture and picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one thing I can imagine  is not that you just have multiple things open  so they're open,  which is what you do with tabs and all that.  Right.  Though the truth is, I'm a Chrome user for so long,  I don't have multiple windows open.  I have tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, tabs.  That's what I have.  Which is basically switching between apps, right?  I mean, it's a full screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little better than on the,  I have to go back to the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, recent, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I can see in some cases where I want two things  on the screen so I can copy one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, copying and pasting from one app to another.  So back in the day, children,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that way back in the day when I worked on my Atex system  at the Chicago Tribune  or maybe the San Francisco Examiner SII system,  you had multiple save get keys.  This is something that I'm amazed  the industry has never had this.  Rather than just one simple memory for save get,  you can save that to A and that to B and that to C.  Oh, that's me.  And then return to it.  So then you came back in.  It's a stack.  So in the days of links and stuff like that,  I want to go save these five things.  And I come back and I can save to one,  save to two, save to three, save to four, save to five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a very Unix-y thing to do.  That is, that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Emacs will do that.  And there are some clipboard apps that will save.  You should use Emacs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd be happy with Emacs because you have buffers.  You have as many infinite buffers  and you switch from buffer to buffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the problem is that I want to move things  back and forth, right?  And I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Now that I read the method, it doesn't,  we just wasted Jake's time.  Oh, we didn't?  Yeah.  Because step one, flash a custom recovery like twerp.  You want to show Gina how it works?  It's early.  Yeah, I'll show you.  So the key-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't have the, sorry,  we don't have the over the shoulder camera yet, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The key is you have, yeah, right.  Just imagine.  This is like, there was a,  Microsoft had an event where they had a guy, he was great.  He was doing this demo of Windows 10.  It was really cool, except they never showed his screen.  So all you see is this guy going,  isn't this great?  Oh, and then you do that?  It's really great.  That's about it.  That's what we're gonna do right now.  So I think once I'm in Recents, right,  I press and hold the Recents button  and it turns into a hamburger.  No, I can't remember how you do it now.  I can't remember either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to remember.  The notifications on and are really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, they've rolled up notifications.  So all the notifications for any given app  are rolled up into one notification.  Yeah, very nice.  More and you can do more with it.  I do, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not enough delineation between each group,  but whatever, they'll tweak the design for my taste.  But yeah, I really like the rolled up notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what you're gonna have to do here  is you're gonna have to enter the ADB shell  and just type the CD slash systems, Etsy permissions,  and then you need to use set.  You're familiar with set.  You know how good I am with this.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Gina tried to talk me through installing Unix  on my first Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that.  Oh, that's right.  Was it Cronut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Cronut.  Oh, god.  Do they still sell Cronuts?  Can I go get a Cronut?  Is that that fat is over already?  It's so over there.  It's pretty over.  It's so tourist.  I always called it Cronut, but it wasn't Cronut.  It was someone.  You know the thing I've always admired about San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that they ghettoize the tourists.  The tourists go to a city that the San Franciscoans  never go to.  We just put you down at Fisherman's Wharf  so we don't have to see you.  And you're going to square and all that, right?  So that's what Cronuts are.  We faked you out.  The tourists go stand in line there like idiots.  No New Yorker who works in San Francisco  is going to go get a freaking Cronut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a Cronut.  Times Square is a little bit of that.  There's a lot of bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not south of 40th Street.  No.  Where we are.  Where the real people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fair enough.  Okay, fair enough.  What do you think of Google Now's new, more natural voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I listened to this video.  I did not hear a difference.  I did not.  They said it was subtle.  It's so subtle that I did not hear it.  Do you have to download it?  Do you have to download it?  It's rolling out.  So there's a video in the article.  I don't know if it's Android police,  but where it's purportedly, allegedly the new voice.  I watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Google Now.  How come your phone responded?  Okay, Google.  Stop it.  I'm talking to this phone.  Sorry.  No.  Oh, now I've really screwed it up.  I'm talking to this phone.  Okay, Google.  Who is George Washington?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is some information about George Washington.  Oh yeah, that sounds different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or maybe I'm imagining it.  You're imagining it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your work.  So you hear things that maybe I don't hear.  That sounds different.  Did it sound different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  How tall is Larry Bird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Bird is six feet, nine inches tall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like a nicer person.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  Who is Leo Laporte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't get a voice response.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been demoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you used to get a voice response?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the rule at Twig.  At some point we're Googling ourselves.  Like that's, everything that we said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, they kill good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the show's dead now.  No more of this.  We can Google.  You can't screw with the boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Amazon Echo knows who I am.  But you've got the knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alexa, who is Leo Laporte?  Little pissing up out there in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Dr. Mom's gonna kill you?  Oh man.  That's really disheartening when that happens.  God, they used to tell my whole biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Leo.  You still,  you still mean a lot to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Unixy is spelled U-N-I-X-Y,  not E-U-N-U-C-H-S-Y.  Okay, just, I wanna make that clear.  When I'm talking, I'm talking the operating system,  not the castrati.  I sounded like that voice was different a little bit.  But maybe I could be imagining that.  I think you're imagining it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I think they fool with you.  So, I'm at an event last week about the Trust Project,  which Google's helping out.  Yeah.  And the wonderful guy who's the product manager-  The Trust Project.  I'll tell you about that in a second.  Okay.  So, the wonderful guy who's,  product guy for AMP is there.  And I've been trying to demonstrate AMP on my phone  to people, and I'm not getting AMP content.  It's slow.  And I said, what the hell?  And he said, oh, there's an A-B test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and you're in the B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of all the people in the world,  I'm the guy who's selling AMP more than anybody on Earth,  and I don't get AMP.  So, A-B fail.  On your browser, you don't get it,  or where are you not getting it?  Yeah, so he had me open up a cognitive window,  and boom, there I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanna see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ever seen AMP work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  I mean, I understand where it is.  Okay, so do a search for Obama.  Okay.  No, no, you have to do it on your phone.  That's why you haven't seen it.  Here, you can go to G.C.R.  You can do it on mine, here, wait.  So, because I'm in the A on it.  Yeah, sure.  My phone's charging.  Okay, so you can see that the,  this is, by the way, this is still the problem I have with AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now AMP results are way up above normal results.  Yeah, I agree, I agree.  So this is an AMP carousel, right?  See how it says AMP there?  So click on one of them.  So I'll click on BBC News, Argentina, Dirty War.  Bing!  Now go to the next one.  Just go.  Oh, I can do it this way?  Yes, Bing!  It's already loaded.  It's fast.  That's really fast.  Sorry, I said Bing.  Sorry you can't see this.  They have a typewriter here named Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what is this blue bar action?  This means that we're watching,  we're looking at the Google copy,  and it's hosted on Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have to be.  But it can be.  It can be cached on Google.  You get free CDN from them.  And oh, the chat room's gonna go nuts  when we get back into AMP and Leo's catches.  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've come to terms with AMP.  I'm okay with AMP now.  Until they took away your voice response.  It's one more indignity.  I have to suffer from Google.  Better or worse than Instant Articles?  One of the reasons I've kind of gotten over it,  I wasn't clear, but I've really verified this for myself,  that AMP is compliant in the sense that  it, so I didn't like, for instance,  that it doesn't use the img tag for an image.  It uses amp-img, right?  But the way it handles it is browser invisible, right?  So it's in a CSS, it's a CSS extension.  So your browser still will use the image tag  if you're not in AMP land.  And so I don't have as much problem with that.  That's just using CSS, in effect.  I still don't think it's,  I still think it's a little bit of a power grab from Google.  I really don't like it that if you want to be  at the top of Google's mobile search results now,  you have to be an AMP page.  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google should set a standard for speed,  and however you get to that standard,  you should be able to be there and be promoted as being fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yahoo, I search for Obama, I get a Yahoo news story,  which I think is not AMPed.  No, in fact, oh, that's nice.  It pushes me to an app for Yahoo's install.  But then there's the carousel,  and I have to go now below the carousel,  below the Knowledge Graph, below the profiles,  this is all Google content,  and now here's a search result.  And then Twitter, and then the rest of the search results,  which used to be the Wikipedia, the Atlantic,  Politico, those used to be on top.  If I were at the Atlantic, I'd be peeved,  because, well, it's not AMP content.  Sorry, Atlantic, there's three pages down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the Atlantic does have, in that list,  wherever it is, an AMP page,  the blue link doesn't send to it yet.  I'm not following.  Blue links don't send to AMP yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blue links meaning in the regular search results?  Oh, so as you follow links.  And AMP is a standard that Google has authored, right,  that anyone could implement anyway.  And if a page is AMP compliant, then it's fast.  If it's AMP compliant, yes.  Right, so tell me about the Power Grab.  You feel like Google is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that right there is Google using its monopoly  in search, and it's not a monopoly, but it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Re-authoring of tags, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, to favor sites that use Google technologies,  not as a web standard, it's a Google technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Google standard.  Yeah.  I understand what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I'm doing a regular website, which I am,  and I don't go all in on AMP,  I don't show up till several scrolls down  on the search result.  Right.  If you're the Atlantic, I'd be a little peeved.  That's pressuring the Atlantic to buy the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you're not forcing people to use Google.  I mean, Google defines the standard.  It's the same as robots to text, right?  I mean, Google has, or meta tags,  they have suggestions for how to write these things,  which everybody does.  But it doesn't affect search results.  That's true.  I mean, it does, but their argument,  and I don't know, their argument is,  we know these pages are fast.  Right.  We know these pages are gonna be a great user experience.  Right, so we're doing it for...  Initially...  Because Google doesn't gain anything intrinsically  by someone else implementing the AMP tags.  Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay, so here's why Google does.  Because what it is is a response to ad blocking.  So normal users, once the web got bogged down  by crap ad tech, said, well, screw that,  we're just gonna block ad tech.  I don't want it, that's screwing me up.  And that, as an ad tech company, terrified Google.  I see.  So they said, oh, well, in lieu of using ad blockers,  what if we made the web fast anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if we gave you fast ads?  Right.  Right, so that's in their interest, certainly,  to encourage fast ads.  It's definitely in their economic interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're using, in my opinion,  I'm not gonna testify in any court case on this,  but in my opinion, they're using their monopoly,  and this is exactly what antitrust laws  protect against, their monopoly in one arena search  to leverage business in another arena,  in this case, advertising.  And they do it all the time.  They do it with YouTube, but they say they don't.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need a faster web.  I think we have been ruining the web.  I think that Google put out a standard,  nobody else put it out.  However, in the implementation, yes,  they were, I think, a bit deaf to the implications.  Now what's happening, I don't know if you saw this,  I don't have it in the rundown,  but Le Monde, I think it was,  put up a very detailed review  of how Instant Articles is working for them,  and how they've not lost traffic,  and they're getting more on Facebook,  but they're not lost, and how it works,  and how modernization is working,  there's all this thing.  Which publication was this?  I think it was Le Monde.  My pronunciation is bad, I apologize.  And so I think the same thing is necessary with AMP  to really get some numbers back  and find out what's happening to the publishers.  And when I've talked to publishers about this,  they say, you know, jury out.  We'll see how this affects our business,  we'll see how it affects our traffic.  But generally, it is for them too,  the only weapon they have against ad blockers.  Yeah.  To speed up the damn pages.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if the answer is,  I don't know if the answer is,  blocking obviously is bad for a lot of content creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yes, this is becoming this week in AMP.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about Facebook?  Sure.  Facebook joins WhatsApp  in dropping BlackBerry support,  followed by, without Facebook.  What took them so long?  Without Facebook, your smart platform is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that about,  talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those two articles, it's kind of a one-two punch.  You and Spence, who's great,  I like you and I follow him, writing for Forbes,  says the news yesterday that Facebook  is dropping support for BlackBerry,  10, shouldn't come as a surprise,  but it's the death now,  and we know this from Windows Phone.  If your app is not on the platform,  and it's an app people want,  they're not gonna use the platform.  Yeah.  And I think that's really what hurt Windows Phone,  was the lack of, you know, Instagram's there now,  but it wasn't there for a while,  and a lot of things aren't there,  including my bank's apps aren't on Windows Phone.  But BlackBerry 10, I mean, even BlackBerry started,  has moved to Android.  Why would anyone buy a Windows Phone?  Actually, HP's making a very interesting product,  which is a Windows Phone,  they announced this at Mobile World Congress,  that uses Windows Continuum technology  to turn into a laptop.  They even sell kind of an inexpensive laptop-like  docking port, so you can imagine in the enterprise,  instead of issuing you a computer,  I'll issue you this phone,  and then you have at your desk, you know, your home office,  you have one of those docking stations,  and at the remote office, they have docking stations.  As soon as I issue you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just issue a little pendant that you wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it's a step into that direction.  Yeah, right, so it's a corporate phone.  It's a corporate phone.  I can't imagine, unless you're just a Windows fan,  I can't imagine as an end user,  you saying, oh, I want a Windows Phone.  You know, in its day, it was very impressive,  but it's become less so over time.  You know, frankly, I still wonder  why people like you use an iPhone.  Oh, you don't use an iPhone.  No, I don't. You use an iPhone.  No, no. No, no.  No iPhones on this show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny, because I had to use,  I did use an iPhone for quite some time,  when the 6S Plus came out.  I had great battery life.  I've been using it since it came out in November,  and I was using the Apple Watch with it,  but as soon as the Galaxy S7 came out,  and I started using it, I went,  oh, I forgot how good this is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a, it's in the rundown.  Oh my gosh.  In the rundown.  Yeah, no, we should talk about, this is Facebook.  Yeah, this is a Facebook story.  It's a picture that you wouldn't see on Facebook,  unless you're a friend of a woman giving birth.  She posted it on her, is this the full picture?  No. No.  There's more?  There's a lot.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, this is.  Well, it's a graphic picture.  She's giving birth, but you know what?  It's a beautiful picture.  Birth is messy, you guys.  And it was for her friends, right?  It was for friends and family.  It was a closed group.  Was it a birth group in New York?  It's actually, as I see it, an amazing picture.  It is really an amazing photo.  Facebook went into her, what she thought,  this was her mistake, was her,  don't keep scrolling down, Jason,  because it does get graphic,  but what she thought was her private group and took it out.  But of course, little reminder, it ain't your private group.  It's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Facebook.  It's Facebook, yeah.  Their orthodoxy about nipples is just amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't block breast feed anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that that had changed.  I think they changed.  I thought that they sort of had loosened up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is extremely graphic.  She's giving birth, but you know,  you see the umbilical cord.  Well, but it's called life.  Yeah.  I think it's a beautiful picture.  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I follow several trans, female to male trans folks  on Instagram, and so before top surgery,  all of their photos are like this.  Yeah.  And afterwards, same person.  Isn't that sad?  Short list.  That says something.  Doesn't that say something?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing.  But that's the world we live in.  It is Facebook's platform.  It is not a public platform.  No, it's true.  And I think in a way, these things are good  to remind people you're not,  as much as you might think, it's not a public service.  This is a private company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Google Photos, I wonder what Google Plus's policy is,  and what's Google Photos is truly your space  and your photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they would never, I don't think,  remove a photo from your Google Photos.  That's your private stuff.  On the other hand, Google Plus, they do have rules,  and they're a little more flexible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's gotta be a lot of body parts stored up  in the private Google Photos.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But as Facebook points out, most of the time,  a picture won't be pulled unless somebody complains.  Right.  They don't have the manpower to go through all those pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have, no, you can use Watson to find.  Automated, yeah.  Yeah, the AI is getting very, very good  at recognizing photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She wrote, she's a teacher, a lactation consultant.  She was blocked.  Facebook message, she says, showed me the picture,  said it violated Facebook's standards of nudity,  then went on to talk about how some photos  are sexually explicit.  This is not.  It then prompted me to remove any other photos  that contain nudity.  The two on the prompt screen were me wearing my baby  in a carrier fully clothed.  That's what's wrong with these automated systems.  This flesh, you know, it's not necessarily easily detected.  After she affirmed that none of her other photos  contained nudity, she was allowed back on the site  and the group.  I mean, I don't know what to say about that,  except if you wanna have a private group,  you should do it somewhere else than Facebook, maybe.  Yeah?  I don't know.  It's difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough, yeah, this is a tough call.  The people are on Facebook, your friends are on Facebook.  If I made a secret or a private group on Facebook,  I would assume, you know.  That it's private.  unless somebody in the group.  I guess you're right, I guess that should be allowed.  I mean, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if somebody complains, then what you ought to expect  is the group to govern itself.  But I guess Facebook doesn't wanna get in the middle  of all that.  What if one member says you shouldn't do this in this group  and the rest of the group says leave the group,  and then what does Facebook do,  you kill that person's account?  Right, that seems.  Have you played with Masquerade yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  This is the, it's better on iPhone.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine for just having done your school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna just let you get back to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My fault.  It's better on iPhone.  Okay, so this is called Masquerade, MSQ.  Let's do it with you.  MSQ already, so get your face in there.  Now I've.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  So your face is on my head.  Okay.  I'll take a picture of it.  Speaking of trans.  Yeah, seriously.  Alex is not working fully on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm transitioning right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  Now we can move to another, see I broke it.  It's permanently.  You're turning around.  It's permanently, I don't know if you can see that.  We do have camera operators, they probably can zoom.  Oh, it's all messed up now.  It's really confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Howell and I did a face smash,  I think it was anybody else.  Yeah, face smash, yeah.  On all of Android, it was equally as horrifying.  Yeah.  No offense, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This crashes Android,  so it's in some sort of weird crash mode right now,  but I think it's sufficiently horrific that you can see.  Anyway, Facebook just bought this company.  And it's kind of a similar effect,  you've probably seen this in Snapchat, right?  Where you can overlay stuff on your.  So you can also just put.  I'll show you, yeah, what I have to do is force quit it  and then go back into it.  There's a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I bought an iPod Touch  so I could try apps out on iOS.  This is perfect for iPod Touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did too.  So here, Jeff.  Now Jeff is a little furry, dog.  He's a gorilla.  He's got a mustache.  There, you can see it.  And I think you look good in that.  That's a good look for you, huh?  So you can see what you would look like with a mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you take the picture of the video, do you send it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a messaging?  You can share it.  In fact, guess where you can share it?  Instagram or Facebook.  And I think that was before.  But the point is, I think that this is,  they couldn't get Snapchat.  So what you're gonna see is Facebook starting to build out  their messaging platform to be as Snapchat-y as possible.  Right, right.  It's fun.  It's fun.  Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of himself as Iron Man.  That is kind of a weird choice.  Yeah.  Well, no, because he's Billy Drunk.  He wants to be Tony Stark.  Well, as I say, he is a billionaire eccentric.  It's too late.  Elon Musk is Tony Stark.  You can't be Tony Stark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what the price was.  It's a Russian company.  But what's interesting is that this technology  is so widespread now.  I don't think it's so hard to do  because I see it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not everywhere.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I hope they got a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you Snapchat, Leah, on a regular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I, yeah, I know and I have it  and I know how to use it and I have.  You're your father and I at that.  But it might be probably Snapchat.  You're so old, like, cannot even figure out how to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, I don't know what's going on.  No, and I asked my son about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he said, well, everybody knows how to use it.  I said, wait, there's no rules.  It doesn't explain.  But I think that generation,  it's the same thing with Minecraft.  Part of, for an app to succeed with a young generation,  Jake, you can further deny this.  I think it has to have a component of peer learning  so that you learn, there's value for Snapchat  of having your buddy say, oh no,  let me show you how to do that.  And then you have this bond.  And you're not gonna tell everybody  that you just didn't know that.  There's an investment, right.  Jake, do you use Snapchat?  He's too old.  Oh, he's gone.  He's off Snapchatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I read that BuzzFeed piece about how, you know,  teens really use, which I'm always a little bit skeptical.  This was several, a couple of months ago.  But I still was like, oh, I don't,  this is beyond my ability.  Snapchat's fun.  Do you do stories or do you do directs?  You do stories.  I do stories, because I'm, that's, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's my problem is I'm a broadcaster.  And the real reason I don't use it  is because after 24 hours it goes away.  And my whole life is built around making stuff  that you keep. Permanent.  I mean, admittedly, there's a certain amount  of fishrap to the stuff we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Twitter, Twitter, yeah, it's there.  But when do you ever go back?  It's gone.  It goes psh psh psh in the mind.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  The MSQRD team is young.  Really? Yeah.  Eugene Nevjevjen, Sergey Gonchar, are 23.  The CEO is Eugene Zatopayakin, and he's 30.  And they have other companies as well.  And it was just one of those things as often happens.  They launched before Christmas.  They took off in Eastern Europe.  You know how that is.  And they were purchased by Facebook in March.  When they had, they had 16 million users  when they were acquired.  Their servers are ready.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure they'll move immediately  to a Facebook infrastructure.  That's a nice, I like that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they don't announce the deal until you've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  They were two other companies bidding against them.  So that's why I think the,  well, we don't know the number.  I'm sure it was, it was good.  Twitter is shutting down EmojiTracker.  That's annoying.  EmojiTracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just get annoyed anytime,  anybody shuts down anything. I'm annoyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just peeved.  I'm taking over from you.  Twitter's got a bad, bad tracker.  Now that I'm here, I decided maybe  we should do something about the-  You got the D-Rosbury.  You know this is like the water area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crank.  Betching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  EmojiTracker, we used, it was the one that said,  that would rank emoji use on Twitter.  It was really cool.  Remember, we showed all the-  In real time, it was really cool.  But Twitter platform operations sent them an email saying,  hello from Twitter.  During our recent audit of our developer platform  or record show, the account associated  with this email address currently has elevated access  to the streaming API.  No, you can't do it.  That no longer exists.  Well, you can pay.  Can't, well, probably it's expensive.  Oh, GANIP, right.  Right.  Because they have the fire hose.  So is that what it essentially was that they said,  you want to use a fire hose, you go to GANIP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think that GANIP offered  the elevated streaming,  offered everything elevated streaming did,  but this is like an indie developer who like open sourced  this whole thing and it was just a kind of fun project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it was more than that because the Emoji Committee  on the Unicor Consortium, there is an emoji committee.  Well, they brought us dumplings.  Yes, they did.  We didn't have dumplings, right?  Thanks to Jenny Eightley.  Jenny Eightley says, we used EmojiTracker.  We wouldn't even consider, we wouldn't,  a big factor in the new emoji criteria  is whether we'd expect to find it above the median  in EmojiTracker, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's too bad.  There's kind of a, there is at some level, I think,  let's see what you think about this, Gina.  I would even argue an ethical responsibility  that if you have this data, that's the voice of the people.  I don't mean at an individual level,  but I mean at an aggregate level.  And in an age when AI can analyze all this  and you can use sensors and do all this thing,  shouldn't that data be open to us, the people who made it?  Yes, we've been saying that all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an old-fashioned way of thinking about it, but yes.  That's what I am.  Yes, I agree.  No, me too, me too.  I absolutely believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I were Hugo Chavez, I'd nationalize it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'd do.  I'm saying, I'm telling you, when Bernie gets in,  we're gonna nationalize Twitter.  We're gonna nationalize Twitter,  just taking it over.  But that would be a good thing to nationalize, right?  That's true.  Wouldn't it?  Sorry, Jack, we want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eminent domain.  Yeah, you're on with the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean part of the reason why I started to think of it  was I was just so annoyed that I couldn't get past  more than 3,200 of my own tweets.  My own tweets, I'm not even talking about  like the tweets of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you use the API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm using just this straight, basic, REST API,  which pages back 3,200 tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you get all the tweets,  you don't get a sample of tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get just 3,200, so if you have posted  more than 3,200 tweets, then I'm only getting that many.  Most people at this point,  the company's been around for 10 years,  who are any sort of user, have more than 3,200 tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, Twitter just had its 10th anniversary.  That's right, they did.  And everybody was posting their first tweet.  My first tweet was actually totally appropriate.  I surrender, Twitter, you win.  My first tweet.  My first tweet.  Totally appropriate, 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first tweet was, okay, I'll try Twitter again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go, you and I, I'm telling you, great minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine was home, time for a nap.  I had just got home from South by Southwest,  and I said, oh, fine.  That's whatever he was using.  I will just sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  No gay vine.  Did you read Jack's interview at the Bloomberg Business,  the future of Twitter and in-depth conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've read how many stories  about the future of Twitter can I read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't know if Jack really knows  what the future of Twitter is.  It's a puddle.  Is that what he said, it's a puddle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess there is, I had missed this.  There was a Periscope video of a puddle  on the street in England that went viral,  where everybody was watching the puddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're watching people, what they're doing with the puddle  and walking around the puddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So that was interesting.  It was interesting that he focused on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was getting 20,000 simultaneous viewers,  total of 650,000 live views of a puddle.  And apparently Twitter was like really in on this.  Jack says I was watching the puddle.  It wasn't even the people in the puddle  or what they were doing.  It was the fact that I was watching with other people  and I was connected to the audience  and I could actually talk with them.  Is that the puddle?  No, that's just my phone.  I'm sure it's not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he really focused on the fact  that Twitter is this real time togetherness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a weird thing for everybody to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the point he was trying to make  is that even the most mundane,  even if there isn't a big news event,  like somebody important dying or whatever,  an attack or whatever, that even the most mundane thing  like a puddle can become a news event  and that's what people do on the internet.  When there isn't news, they make news,  the dress or whatever.  And I sort of get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just a little bit of a weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The puddle was a weird analogy,  but what he ends up saying I think is accurate.  Twitter can be distilled down to the simplicity of  here's what's going to happen in the world,  here's what's happening right now.  And I agree, that's what Twitter is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here's the funny thing about Twitter is  Twitter thought it was gonna be  here's what's happening with you,  instead it's trying to here's what's happening in the world.  Which is amazing.  And that's amazing.  Right.  Which is different than Facebook.  And as I said to me, we didn't know  it was gonna be a news service.  It's a news service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you couldn't even imagine that  unless you've got critical mass.  And you wouldn't as a startup just say,  well of course we're gonna have 800 million,  actually they only have 300 million users,  but we're gonna have the right 300 million I guess.  Right.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm interested to know what you think about  Matter becoming its own company.  Because you're the medium.  You're my medium person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of changing his mind.  Yes.  I have the greatest respect for Matter,  but I imagine working forever is what's I'm thinking today.  Well how do you wake up?  Right.  Or Donald Trump wears the white hat if he's happy  and the red hat if he's not.  Though does he seem only in the red hat these days?  So I think that there was a time when medium wanted  to be a content company, a publisher itself,  a platter shirt, God help us.  And I think that they're not in that as much anymore.  They're getting prominent people to write on  and use medium.  Very successfully.  Very successfully and that's working.  My old agent Kate Lee is doing a great job of that and others.  But I think the idea that they had to own content  and they had to prime the pump, I think they're less into.  So he didn't kill it, he didn't jettison it.  It's owned 100% by Ed Williams.  It's now a content laboratory.  So I don't know what the hell that means,  but I didn't know what the hell Twitter meant.  I didn't know what the hell Matter meant either.  Yeah.  So it could be just a way that you kind of save face  to keep it alive or it could be that they mean it  and they're gonna try new things.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is Matter the parent company of medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, Matter was a Kickstarter backed  journalistic magazine-y thing that medium bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was just a publication on media.  I didn't realize it was rooted in a Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bobby Johnson was one of the founders of The Guardian  and they started it separately  and they did a whole big Kickstarter raise.  So it was controversial when they got bought,  like, hello, I gave you money, where's mine?  But that's happened more than once.  Yeah, that happened with Oculus Rift, right?  Yeah, right.  And so they've done some neat things.  I take it back in the sense that, of course,  medium does have its own content products  insofar as our good friend,  age, this is simply age talking,  former Wired, former Newsweek, Rights About Technology.  Steven Levy.  Steven Levy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Steven Levy's back channel.  So he has a back channel.  Oh, he's a back channel, right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is on staff.  That is an owned and operated channel.  Like Matter, but not Matter.  But not Matter, right.  So they still don't have content.  It's a confusing mess.  They still do have content,  and they're moving this off to be a laboratory.  So I don't, who knows?  Ev doesn't know.  That's the joy of Ev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have said, he has said that we might start  doing advertising on this.  Yes.  So there is a plan perhaps to monetize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just betting, my guess is, Gina,  that they're saying, okay, this is fun,  we're not gonna kill you,  let's see if you can't make a go of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did Ev spin Matter out, or did they spin themselves out?  I mean, who's-  Ev spun Matter out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still owned by Ev,  but it's operating separately from Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's on Media, it's using Media in the platform still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm-  That's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very confusing.  And it's not a website, they say.  It's not a website.  Right, because nobody wants to be a website anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on the web.  Nobody wants to be a website.  You look at it in the browser, but it's not a website.  You don't wanna be an app, you don't wanna be a website,  you wanna complain to the convention  about being on the platforms,  and you just wanna be unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't let the internet name your boat.  I'm just saying, this is never a good idea.  The British-  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  We're starting a new show in New York.  Why don't we let the internet name the show?  Oh, we should!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what a name we'll get.  So the British government decided to let the internet  suggest a name for a $287 million polar research ship.  And the name, ladies and gentlemen,  RRS Boaty McBoatface.  The wisdom of the crowd.  It is the greatest thing.  The government suggested names like the Shackleton,  the RSS Endeavor, Falcon, no, no.  More dignified options. Boaty McBoatface.  This is, as you might remember,  very much in the same vein as the Slovak Bridge naming.  In 2012, the actual lawmakers had to override  the public's vote.  They wanted the public to decide to name it  after Chuck Norris.  A year earlier in Austin, Texas,  people tried to name the city's waste management service  Fred Durst, although Limp Bizkit would have been better  for a waste management service.  So it's 4chan is the problem, I think.  Anyway-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we are to be Twiggy McTwigface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twiggy McTwigface.  I think not a bad name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Incidentally, the guy who proposed the name  Boaty McBoatface is a public relations guy  and former BBC employee.  He tweeted it and now his latest tweet is,  I'm terribly sorry about all of this.  My apology.  So I hope they name it Boaty McBoatface.  It's not over yet.  The polls close April 16th.  So you have time to change it to Shackleton or Endeavor.  But-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still the most loved all time,  the most loved today.  People are still voting for Boaty McBoatface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's so many people are voting,  the website keeps crashing.  Here's one, Eufasia Superba.  Vivian Fuchs, Deep Blue Explorer.  There's quite a few of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But look at the most loved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most loved overall.  Let's see, number one, RSS, RRS Boaty McBoatface.  And I presume Henry Worsley is another joke.  Probably a British joke.  David Attenborough, that'd be a good name.  Or the RRS is bloody cold here.  Usain Bolt, good name.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that one.  Usain Bolt is pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boaty McBoatface, the return of Boaty McBoatface.  Well-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boatmas Prime.  That's great.  Internet jokesters.  The RRS Boat.  Thanks for all the fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like big boats and I cannot lie.  RRS Wet Iceberg.  Remember it is gonna be in the Antarctic.  Wow, most loved today.  Actually, you know what?  They're getting a lot of attention.  They are.  They are.  You know what?  Go ahead, go with it.  Name it then.  Can I vote?  Can I heart Boaty McBoatface?  I did.  I voted.  Thank you for voting.  Okay, another problem.  There was no sign up.  There was no registration.  I just voted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many scripts are just getting mad at your URL?  I just voted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The website is nameiorschip.nerc.ac.uk,  if you'd like to cast your vote.  Go to NERC.  Let's see, anything else?  This is fun.  I don't know what time it is  because I can't understand the clock.  Approximately 6.30.  So that would be 3.30 our time.  So this is a good time to start wrapping up here.  Last minute stories in the...  Well, I think we do have to talk about...  The Happy Meal from the CUNY.  By the way, I am also wearing CUNY swag.  Yeah.  I'm gonna disperse the brand.  This is a nice hoodie.  Thanks.  Was it Simon who gave me this?  Thank you, Simon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are now a Capital J journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is in honor of the CUNY School of Journalism team  that's playing in the March Madness NCAA Finals right here.  That's what they told me.  So I find it...  All right, Leo.  Yes.  Oh, you wanna talk about porn.  Yeah, I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's giving me the look.  I've never seen it.  Why am I the expert on this?  So I'm saying I haven't seen it.  What do you think of VR porn, Gina?  Welcome back, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Pornhub, which is a very well-known,  I hear very well-known, popular,  it's kind of the YouTube of porn, I think.  They have added a virtual reality section  for both Oculus and Google Cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's the thing, here's the thing, just in theory,  it's like the problem I have with interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Pornhub is the 65th most visited site  on the internet.  That's where we created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't either.  Right, because you're not in space again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  unless you're in an orgy, maybe, but then I don't get it.  Is it just because it's new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enthusiasts will try it because it's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to bait him, it's just not working.  I'm trying my best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought he was being incredibly restrained.  I'm really impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, just research.  And I have a VR and a Samsung Galaxy S6,  and it turns out there are a number of providers  of adult content who actually make VR video.  And it's scarily realistic, actually.  Really? Yeah.  Is that good or bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is it fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, do you think porn is fun?  Well, sure, let's assume you think porn is fun.  If you think porn is fun.  We can speak like adults, I mean, you know, whatever.  If you think porn is fun, you will quite enjoy this.  Really?  Because it's immersive.  The whole idea, this is what VR is all about, right?  It's putting you in the middle of the action.  But it's not like-  As if you're one of the players?  As if you're one of the players, yeah.  So the ones I've seen, the way they shoot it is,  they, and actually, in my mind,  I always am thinking about the performer  who's got something strapped on their head.  Because what they do is, yes, it's, you're a performer.  And it's on your face, apparently, because-  Of what you're seeing.  Yeah, and so what you're seeing is,  because you can see your own body.  You can look down and go, whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what happens when things go off the rails?  Like when the thing that you wouldn't have done happens?  It's like, that's the part I think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He or she, and by the way,  that's what's really interesting,  is to put yourself in the female perspective for a man.  And I have a new appreciation.  What do you think?  For, I don't know.  How do you talk about this in a way that's not weird?  No, it's okay.  I'm enjoying this immensely.  I know, it's really great.  You're welcome, audience.  Here's what it is, is normally when you're watching a movie,  or we're used to it now with video games,  but when you're watching a movie or television show,  or adult content, the director is choosing what you see.  Right.  In a video game, and you know,  because you've played video games, you look around.  You look up, you look down.  So in an adult, now Jason, don't,  I think you probably shouldn't.  But so in an adult environment, you look around,  you can see where you are, you can see the space.  Very much like the video that Jason's showing on the screen.  Don't look to the right.  I'm very nervous right now.  Don't look to the right, whatever you do.  So you can actually look and you can see the set,  and you can see, you can't see the camera  because you are the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like a first person shooter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, literally, sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show title.  And you get to choose, I'm sorry, I haven't tried this,  but do you get to choose which player you wanna be?  It depends.  No, not the way this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you watch it.  This is a game.  You choose a movie, right?  So you would be like watching a porn video,  except that the difference is that you're the camera,  your head is the camera and you're looking around.  The only thing you really,  the only thing you really can't see is your own face.  Right. Right.  But you can look down and see your shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get to be one player.  There's one choice.  You are one person in this interaction.  Well, how would you be more than one person?  Could you be, because you were saying,  you could be a man or a woman.  Could I switch and say I wanna be, oh yeah, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to pick the video you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then, and it's so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina just wrote a new application.  I'm just curious, how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's various flavors.  I mean, is it like, oh, be this person in this scenario?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you could take any content.  That's not even adult content.  This is really hard to discuss without.  No, you take any content,  any without saying it's adult content.  Let's say we're taking a walk in the park.  You pick that walk in the park,  because it's not live.  You're picking a pre-recorded walk in the park,  but they're recording it like with the Theta 360.  They're recording it in such a way that you can,  you can't not walk, because you're walking.  Right, that's what it is.  But you can look around as you're walking.  You can see what's behind you,  what's in front of you, up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you were walking a dog in the park,  would you get the choice to be the dog or the human?  No. No.  No, you get to be the human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless somebody makes a video of you as a dog,  and then you're experiencing it as a dog.  See, this is exactly, this guy's holding up the three.  I mean, this is kind of an interesting thing, yeah.  So there is, I mean, beyond the salacious part of this,  there is an interesting experience to be had,  because you are, in effect,  putting yourself in somebody else's shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Porn does lead in ways.  Okay, you're safe now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it actually is a larger discussion,  and sometimes really big,  about what the experience of immersive video is  versus the experience of a passive viewer.  Yes.  And really, that's it, is that you're looking around.  Now, some of these VR tools, like the Vive,  which will give you hand controls,  may even give you, you know,  one of the reasons I think you get sick in VR  is you don't control your motion very well.  So you're being moved around  in ways that you don't fully control.  And augmented reality doesn't have that problem,  because you are walking and moving.  And so your movement controls what you see.  With VR helmets, it's really your head movement only  that's controlling what you see.  So that's a little bit of a disconnect.  It has to do with the narrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, like, there's a sequence of events that happens,  right?  You're in a movie.  Until you get to look around,  but, right, you're in a movie, right?  But you're choosing the point of view in the movie.  You're choosing the point of view,  you're not choosing what's happening.  Right.  And things are happening  whether you're looking at them or not.  It's a little bit disconcerting, I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can be.  It's also very interesting.  And I think that's why it's interesting for news, because...  Which is seriously why I asked.  Yeah, now you're seeing...  They just test the ideas here, yeah.  Yeah, now you're seeing...  So I watched the Times stuff,  and the Times, the first thing the Times did,  they did other stuff,  but the first thing the Times did  was about children displaced by war.  Right.  My, again, and this is probably because of my training,  I don't think so much about what I'm seeing  as the mechanics of producing it.  And so the first thing I do is I look around and say,  well, where's the reporter?  So this child is going through her day  in a bombed out house,  and she's making breakfast and stuff.  And I'm thinking, what did they do?  Did they set up a camera?  They did.  And they said, okay, I'm gonna leave the room,  just lead your normal life.  Yeah.  And that's a little strange in terms of news gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's pictures of them kind of lurking over the edge  so they could see what was going on,  but they weren't in the image because the image is there.  Yeah, I think that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see that all the time.  I see a movie, like I'm watching Les Miserables, the movie,  and I'm thinking about the playback and the crew,  and like, well, is she singing that now,  or is she listening to sound?  So that's just me.  And so when I see these news stories,  I always think, that's bad, that's wrong, that's staged.  Yes, I agree with you.  And so I think it'd be much smarter  as a reporter to be in the...  But then you have another problem,  which you're always supposed to talk not to do,  which is you're in the story.  But maybe that's what this means.  That's what immersive means is you're in the story.  So it opens up a whole bunch of interesting things.  And in the adult context, I think it is very interesting.  It's not something I would do regularly, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like it's gonna take over  just regular watching a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the question is, does it potentially increase empathy?  You kind of said you...  Are you a cataclysm?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  That I would agree with.  And just as maybe if you're watching Children of War...  No, well, I have empathy for women in porn.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I appreciate that.  No, I know, but I mean, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that was actually a very interesting experience  because it was like, I'm kind of being abused here.  To be frank.  That's why we love you, Leo.  I mean, it was like, no, stop that.  No, no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway.  So fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the conversation I always wanted to avoid.  And I managed to.  Your school's very proud of you right now.  For a long time.  We're all right around, I think so.  It is germane to what your school is up to.  And it's very much part of what I think  auteur's of virtual reality.  You're gonna have to really think about  is what does immersive video mean?  What is the role of the auteur, whether it's journalists  or just a photographer, what is the role?  And in the case of adult entertainment,  you're the performer, which is a really weird situation.  I guess it would be as if you're in a play,  let's say you're doing a VR of a play  and you're one of the actors in the play.  You would have the experience of the play as a performer  and not as an audience member.  That's what happens in adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that has a huge opportunity to change things,  but it's fundamentally changed the idea of storytelling,  the idea of presence, the idea of photography.  Point of view, everything.  Point of view, all that.  But is it gonna be huge?  I don't know.  I mean, what do you think it is?  No, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it is.  I don't mean just porn, I mean 360.  No, I actually, I don't know what the future  of adult content is, but I think in general,  immersive video is huge, but it's such a new medium.  We are just in the infancy of what do you do  and how does it work?  But I think you were saying empathy is very interesting.  I hadn't really thought about that, but absolutely.  That's what I heard you say, yeah.  Yeah, that is one thing you would absolutely get out of that  is this sense of empathy.  You also, there's a, I mean, the way that Samsung  was selling its 360 camera is as a way to go with,  yeah, this is the children of war,  which I mean, it's just such a horrific story,  and I do think that you would gain some empathy from this.  I'm sure that's what the New York Times is thinking.  The Samsung was selling it as, well, you can't be in Paris  with your friends, but they can walk around  with their gear camera and you can wear your gear VR  at home and have the experience of walking down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a woman on Google Plus,  I think her name was Emma Monica, who was not very mobile.  She had some health conditions.  Perfect example.  So she would, there were cases where you could  take a photographer in a canoe and say,  oh, can you go to the left there?  Yeah.  I mean, that's phenomenal.  I'm very bullish on this.  I think it's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even if you don't direct the action,  you're with your friends, and if it's in real time  and you're talking to them, I mean, imagine if you were here  sitting here in VR, you'd be part of the action.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm all in on it.  Should we do a VR episode of Twig?  Well, I've actually been really intrigued,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and once the cameras get better, we will do that.  That's cool.  Yeah, we will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I almost kind of want to just be the silent observer,  like have the reporter in it and have it going on,  but have just someone else.  You know, if someone wanted to be at Twig,  they could sit right here and be able to look at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is so much aimed one way.  Well, I'll give you an example.  How would you rethink, I mean, a true round table,  Charlie Rose's table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be very different.  You'd be in the middle of the table, maybe.  One of the first VR things they did  was one of the first presidential debates,  the Republican debates.  And I was amazed.  So it started before the debate,  you're in the back of the room.  And I'm looking around, it's as if you're in the audience,  but it's weird because I think the people who are in the  audience didn't realize that they were on camera  because it's just a little ball.  And I'm looking down,  I'm actually looking over somebody's shoulder.  I can see him looking at his phone.  There's a television camera guy next to me who's waiting  because he's going to tell by his face,  he's chewing gum and he's going,  and you're looking around.  It's like you're an invisible character sitting there.  Then they turned out they had many cameras.  So I first, I thought this is going to be terrible  because I'm in the back of the auditorium  and they're way down there.  But then they switched to the really interestingly,  a backstage camera.  And they've done this a couple of times with the debates.  It's very interesting to be backstage watching the candidates  as they're introduced.  That's neat.  That was an amazing experience.  And you really felt like you see, you know,  Carly Fiorina kind of adjust herself and gear,  bring gear up to go on stage.  I actually really enjoyed that.  So I think there's huge opportunity to be part there.  Is this the video from the debate?  I guess it is.  Yeah.  Huge opportunity to be part of in an event  in a way that we don't normally get to be.  And I think that's exciting.  Hey, let's take a break.  Do you want to do, we don't have a, you know,  what was that change log thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have a change log.  I do have a tip.  You have a tip?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have a number?  All right, I'll come up with a tool.  But before we do that, this is a great time.  If you're in the market for a new phone to go to gazelle.com  Apple's announced a new phone.  There's really great new Android phones.  Maybe you want a Galaxy S7.  Hey, that's an $800 phone.  Here's how you can help pay for it.  And I know a lot of people who do this,  they like to have the latest thing.  They go to gazelle to sell the old one,  generate some cash to pay for the new one.  You could trade in your old device.  You don't even have to commit at this point.  You can commit gazelle, but you don't have to commit.  When you go there and get a quote for your device,  gazelle's locked in for 30 days.  That means you have 30 days to decide  whether you're going to get the new phone,  wait for the phone to arrive, transfer your data over,  and then click the checkout button  and gazelle will send you a box.  They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  In fact, while you're at it, pile in a bunch of stuff.  You can get cash, PayPal credit, or an Amazon gift card.  They bump that up 5%.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E is easily the best way to sell your used gadgets.  They buy a whole bunch of different stuff.  They'll even buy broken iPhones and iPads.  They can resell those for parts.  And if you can't remove the data or you forget to,  don't worry, they wipe the data before they sell it.  They protect you.  You can also buy a gazelle, and I like this.  They take the best stuff that they buy  and they sell it back on gazelle.  Now here's why this is a good time to do that,  because they're getting a lot of new stuff.  iPhone 6S is coming in for people  who want to get the new iPhone.  6S Plus is there's iPads, there's Samsung Galaxy phones,  and they have a wide range to choose from.  They always put every device  through a rigorous 30-point inspection  to make sure that the screen's not scratched  and everything works.  They also back it by a 30-day return policy.  What's nice is these will work on all the major carriers,  but you never are getting an extension  on your carrier contract.  There's no contract.  So go to gazelle.com, see what your device is worth,  and then check out the selection  of certified pre-owned devices.  By the way, they are now offering financing,  which I love, from a firm,  and you can do that at checkout.  You just check the box, provide some basic information.  Approval is instant.  You can pay in three, six, or 12 months  using bank transfer or a check or debit card.  Just check that box that says  financing with a firm when you check out.  You can also buy a 12-month warranty on cell phones  against water damage, cracked screens,  hardware defects, that kind of thing, from Insurrent.  And they do offer help processing claims  and so forth at gazelle.com.  The best value on certified pre-owned devices  and the best dollars for your pre-owned devices  when you sell them to Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle.com.  Go there today.  Gina Trapani has a tip of the week for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do, I do.  This is courtesy of my alma mater, Lifehacker.  So I think I've talked about  what a big fan of Google Keep I am.  I really like Google Keep.  I didn't make you defend Nick Denton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Go ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Prove it for the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can talk about that over dinner.  It's the First Amendment, I understand.  I'm in the tank, you know.  What are you gonna do?  It's the First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  I'm gonna use that.  Go ahead.  You have a tip for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A tip for us.  Google Keep, it's a great app.  I love Google Keep.  It's a great app.  Do you use it with your wife?  I do, we do.  We share notes.  Yeah, yeah, a shopping list.  Like this is stuff I need you to pick up on your way home  and that kind of thing.  I have it all on here.  So there's a little ad checkboxes list.  I'm a list maker, that's what I do.  Well, there's a voice command.  You can say, if you've got say a Google Keep note  called shopping list.  I do, right here.  Or just shopping, sorry.  If it's just called shopping,  you could use the voice command add milk to my shopping list  and Google will just add milk to your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Add milk to my list.  Okay Google, okay Google, okay Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop it.  My list is not named shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to have a list named that.  So I've got a note called like movies to watch  and I could say, okay Google, add milk.  But you can have an arbitrary name, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could say add bacon to my Petaluma market list, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that works.  So I'm very excited when that works.  That is really nice.  We do have a list called shopping.  That's something that's been on iOS for a long time.  Add turkey bacon in your case.  And in fact.  So where does it add it on iOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the reminders.  Oh, reminders, yeah, yeah.  And then I think you can use location too.  Now I know you can with Keep.  I don't know if you can say the location,  but you can say, when I get to Petaluma market,  remind me to buy chicken.  It's very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google reminders does that.  I know there's location based reminders.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, really cool.  Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very nice.  When I get to work, remind me to call Joey and things like that.  Yeah, that's very, very helpful.  Keep, everybody should be using Keep.  And by the way.  And the widget is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the widget on my phone.  Oh, I haven't put the widget on the phone.  Yeah, I mean, I have a couple of notes that I refer to.  I just like, you know.  I didn't do that.  Yeah, it's got a pretty good widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love widgets.  I'm all in on the widgets.  You are, you are all in on the widgets.  Sometimes people think I have my phone screens  are kind of busy because they are.  They're a little bit busy.  It's like Times Square, isn't it?  I just saw you flip through 50.  It's like all sorts of stuff.  15 packed screens.  Yeah, I have, but those widgets, every one of them.  See, that's what I like about, as opposed to iOS.  I've got information, like there's the New York Times  and I have information on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the calendar widget is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm probably showing precious data here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the thing that I really miss the most on iOS  is the widgets.  Or lack thereof on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, they gotta update their interface.  You can't even, they don't have,  they don't have an app drawer.  They don't have, you can't have like an icon  in more than one place.  It can only exist in one folder.  It's crazy.  It's like the year 2010 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very limiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Don't get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's beyond simplicity to limiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like you to give us a number.  A number?  Face, Boaty McBoat Face.  Do you have a New York accent?  Jarvis Mc, hey, Jarvis McJarvis Face, give me a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I found this, it's one of the greatest challenges  in advertising is what we call attribution.  Did the ad cause this sale?  Can I prove that and can I charge for that?  Yes, no one can do that.  Well, just wait.  Square has just done a deal with Facebook to integrate.  So a local advertiser, for example,  can buy an ad through Square  and then it does the full cycle  so that if the customer comes in  and buys the thing in the store,  you know that ad worked on Facebook.  Oh, neato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very cool.  Yeah, that is cool.  That's kind of, I mean, that's why we use offer codes.  That's the same thing as we do offer codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, but now the customer has to go to the effort  in that case.  That's right, this way it's automatic.  To say you use the Twig offer code.  Now, says the Square's Customer Engagement League,  the ability to track and close the loop  from advertisement to sale, that's the holy grail.  That's true, and it rhymes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just regular tracking doesn't work for that.  Like just regular link tracking doesn't work  because the store doesn't feedback,  doesn't give the information back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, of course, the larger problem is  you decide you're gonna go to Bermuda  and you see an ad and then you go to Wikipedia  and then you go to Travelocity  and then you go here and then you go there.  So who gets the credit?  Right.  It's still never gonna be a firm science,  but it's interesting to me  this potentially increases the value of Facebook  in those sales immensely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if we could do, we can't really do this  because we can't, we don't control the player.  That's because they control the transaction.  Yes.  And they can do that.  There was no way we could do that  because we don't control the player or the transaction.  We have really no way of doing that.  Okay, nevermind, I'm not gonna do it.  But that's why people like us,  we don't track their behavior.  Because you can't.  If you could, you would.  If I could, I would.  My app is a weather app called BloomSky.  And actually I found out about this probably,  I think it was an Instagram ad.  I hate those ads.  I hate it that every 10th picture is an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They seem a lot like they're-  It's annoying.  Very frequent recently.  However, it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess so.  Here you are.  And the reason was I was looking for a weather app  so I could see what it would be like in New York  when we came here and I have a lot of weather apps.  But what BloomSky does is it gives you weather cameras.  So for instance, here's PC Magazine,  they're on Park Avenue.  And more than that, it will give you a time lapse.  So this is what it looks like right now.  But I can say, well, what's the weather been like all day?  And we'll actually do a time lapse  from these BloomSky cameras of the whole day.  So you can see-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like the old joke in all the presidents' been,  they sell the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday's mail  because you were too stoned to know what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I like to see the weather from yesterday sometimes.  I'm not in Petaluma right now.  I could see what it was like.  So San Francisco, that's why.  Would you miss?  Yeah.  Now the-  Weather FOMO.  Weather FOMO.  Now the trick on this is you have to have,  it has to be a BloomSky base station.  They sell these weather stations with cameras built in,  but they've got them all over.  In fact, I even checked in Petaluma.  And there are a lot of people in Petaluma that have these.  So I can get, to use a word you might like,  a hyper local weather forecast.  There's that BloomSky thing.  So this is a time lapse from a BloomSky camera  in Petaluma earlier today.  So I think it's kind of,  that's kind of a neat-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now what you wanted to do is to show you  what it will look like in an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  by using the AI to make a picture.  There's no freaking future.  It's just the past.  That's the BloomSky thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are serious cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's also the weather station.  So it tells you air quality, UV, temperature,  a lot of stuff, wind.  And you can go to bloomsky.com and see these.  I mean, there's also the website.  But I don't know, like,  unfortunately the BloomSky's are kind of expensive.  They're like $300.  I'm really tempted.  They look nice.  Cause it'd be kind of cool to see what-  No, you're tempted to buy something you don't need.  No.  Yeah, well, I haven't bought it yet.  But I'm very tempted to,  cause it'd be kind of nice to look at your backyard  and see what the weather was.  That's true.  You're right, it's weird.  It's backwards weather.  It is. It is.  It's what happened, not what's going to happen.  I mean, they have regular weather in it too,  but I kind of like just looking at the day and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the site has some nice-  It's pretty, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Foliage in, in autumn foliage in Denver.  Looks like-  Look at the camera, it's rained on.  It's rain.  Mostly it's rain.  Hey, this has been really fun.  We should just do the-  Let's move to New York.  I would love to do that.  I don't know if I can get Lisa to go there.  How are rents here?  They're pretty good, right?  Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very affordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No problem at all.  Yeah, you're right.  Just go out to Staten Island and you'll really get a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could tell by the way that-  Jersey.  We're going up because we went to get a slice  when we got in at two in the morning,  we went to get a slice.  That's what you do, right?  Right.  Well, you-  No one can afford to own a pizza place in New York anymore.  There's no, where did all the rays go?  They must've moved downtown or something.  There's nothing around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too expensive.  Really, there wasn't a pizza place around here?  If you think about it, $20 a square foot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not gonna be able to make so enough pizza  to make that worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No Howard Johnson's on Times Square anymore.  It used to be, right?  There was a Howard Johnson's.  It used to be, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, Howard Johnson's.  No Nathan's.  Yeah, no Nathan's anymore.  No papayas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No papaya king.  Papaya king.  That's right.  Gone, yeah.  I was with the days, no strip joints, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's still Nathan's in Coney Island,  which is where Nathan's to be, just to be clear.  But it used to be on Times Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, it's just the rent.  The rent was too much.  And down in the village, the papaya king is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that one down on West Worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it's called?  Yeah, it's gone.  This is a really amazing place.  I have to say, this CUNY school,  the graduate school of journalism is a gorgeous facility.  In the heart of Times Square,  you're really in a great location.  Those kids who are studying here are very, very lucky.  Next to the Times, right?  Next to the Times.  Yeah.  And man, look at this studio.  You've got a television studio, so thank you.  And I really want to thank the guys that,  there was a George and who else?
