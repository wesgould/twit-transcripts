Transcript:  It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff and Stacey are here.  We've got lots to talk about. Stacey has been keeping an eye on Amazon re-invent.  The conference is going on right now. Amazon made dozens of new product announcements.  We'll break many of them down for you in the next few minutes.  Google Fi opens up to other handsets and, towards the end,  maybe the most important story of the year involves gene editing.  It's all coming up next on Twig.

And today it's going to be a lot of news from the Amazonverse.  Here to talk about all and sundry, we've got Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  He's the Leonard Tao, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, Jeff.  Leonard Tao, professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York  and director of the Tao Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  And he blogs at buzzmachine.com. He just barely fits behind his lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Professor Jarvis, hello. Hello and happy almost birthday Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. Yes, they've decorated the set a little prematurely with birthday hats.  Tomorrow's your day off. Tomorrow I'm taking day off for my birthday and that's my day off anyway.  Yeah. Yes. And Stacey Higginbotham is also here from stacey on iot.com.  She's had a lovely day trying to follow the 372 announcements that Amazon made at Amazon.  What is it? Amazon Relay? Re-Invent. Re-Invent. Redo. Request. AWS Re-Invent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we've got race cars, fish, blockchain, AI. It's going to be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They announced so many products. It's mind-boggling.  Yeah, the most interesting one was something called DeepRacer and you can go to aws.amazon.com slash DeepRacer to find out more.  I actually ordered it. It's not going to come until March. Just kind of a bummer.  It is, they say, the fastest way to get rolling with machine learning, literally, get hands-on with the fully autonomous 1-18th scale race car driven by Reinforcement Learning 3D Racing Simulator and Global Racing League.  So I guess they're going to have a league, the world's first global autonomous racing league. I have no idea what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know if this is the most exciting piece of news, but it is definitely well packaged, deep nerdy news that you're like, oh my God.  So what they're talking about here, and it is big news. Don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of other news coming out.  But this one, what's cool is they are showing a way to do what's called reinforcement learning at the edge.  And by edge, they mean on a tiny little race car.  So what they're doing is they're training a model using something called reinforcement learning.  And the way reinforcement learning works, it's actually the same way that they trained Google's DeepMind to play Atari games.  So you basically give it a goal and you're like, if you get it right, you keep going.  If you get it wrong, you fall off, like in the car case, you derail and you're like, oh, that's not how.  And each time it gets it right, it optimizes for that moment. So that's what reinforcement learning is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's like that Brev Walker I used to have, which is a screensaver, a box with four legs that couldn't walk, but it would keep trying different strategies.  And then it would note, hey, I got a little farther this time and so incorporate that strategy.  And the theory was over days, weeks and months, and it did take a long time, it would actually teach itself to walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I don't know if that's the exact model that that one was using, but it's similar concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a long time ago. I mean, this is a decade ago or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why I'm like, maybe because I don't actually know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man, I wish I could still find this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what's cool about this is they're basically training the car in this tiny, tiny little car.  They're going to be like, OK, car, we've trained you on these tracks.  Now go and it's going to put it out in the real world.  This is a big deal because you have to train things in the cloud and these giant GPUs.  But then you also have to use models that are you're building these super complicated models and getting them to run on a device and a device that's like battery powered without a lot of compute power.  It's really hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's not connected to a server somewhere.  It's not it's not doing this in the cloud.  It's doing it on on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on board and it's using.  So that's why this is really interesting.  I mean, it can connect to the cloud, but it's not it's not it learns the tracks and then runs them.  So that's that's what's kind of happening here.  That's worthwhile.  It is also.  I guess I'm not I'm not 100 percent sure.  I don't see how you can do a track race unless you have the same track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, that that I'm not 100 percent sure.  I'm like, I don't know how this works.  I can explain the technical weird stuff behind it.  But like how how you win, I don't know.  But this is presumably they're doing races.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Having a racing on.  But they're not like your physical things there.  It's on it's online.  Right.  You upload your what you taught your racer and see how it does against other racers in a virtual environment.  It looks like evaluate your model on a simulated racetrack.  Tune your reward function and hyper parameters.  The training can to improve lap times.  Then submit your model to the virtual leaderboard to enter the AWS DeepRacer League.  Oh, but then it does.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I take it back.  Then once you've been accepted, deploy your model to the AWS DeepRacer to pit your skills against others in real world racing events.  This sounds pretty awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so like what I was talking about, so the reward function in like the video game things, it's like don't die in here.  It's going to give you lots of different options for reward functions and person or parameters.  Maybe it's like, hey, you can take turns this fast.  I don't know what's important in racing, but those are the kind of things that you'll train it with.  And you'll be like, OK, let's say your actual end goal is to, you know, stay upright and not fall off a track.  Then it might go slower and you're like, oh, that's a crappy end goal.  Let's train it using this instead.  This is really simplistic.  I'm just trying to keep it light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate to be a Scrooge McKilljoy, but oh, doesn't it just go around and around and around and around?  What's to learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's probably I mean, if it's a simulator, there's 20 different races.  I'm assuming they're going to be kind of like the racetracks.  Like if you do Formula One, how each track is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You won't know what the track is ahead of time.  You're training it to enter an unknown situation and navigate.  Oh, like this, by the way, I downloaded what we've been talking, downloaded and installed the Brev Screensaver.  So this Screensaver is going to it's it's keeps dropping this thing in here and trying to walk.  You see it has not, in fact, traveled any distance at all.  So that is a failed iteration and it's going to keep iterating until it finds an iteration that actually moves.  And I'll tell you what, next year, just ask me.  We'll leave this on for a year.  See if it walks.  It's kind of it's I think it's the same kind of thing.  Except that you can this is this you can have inputs to your deep racer as opposed to this, which just kind of, you know, the best distance I've done is three meters and somehow out this this brick doesn't look like it's going anywhere.  Oh, here's one.  Oh, this is interesting.  Look at that.  See, it moved.  It moved.  It flipped itself over.  Yeah.  So, well, it's learned something here.  This was the by the way, this is the new champion.  3.57 meters.  It's actually it I used to put on my kids computers.  They loved it because it was that it was, you know, for little kids.  This is great because it's one thing more inept than they are at learning how to navigate the world.  So deep racer is cool.  I ordered one.  I don't know if I have the yes.  I have a feeling I can do it.  It seems I guess the question is, who is this intended for?  Is this intended for kids to learn or for adults who are actually working in the field to do stuff with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's going to be probably for both, but mostly for adults who like to play with these toys.  It's a toy, though.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here it is.  Here's the league.  It's open to everyone.  Live events.  They'll be at London, Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, New York at AWS Summit locations.  This is PR, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm kind of like, is this the biggest news?  I mean, from an economic standpoint in Amazon's business?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty it's $249.  So actually, this price is $300.  So it may help Amazon's bottom line a little bit.  They get people excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh, Leo.  Here's what I found for you.  So your screensaver uses agent based modeling as opposed to reinforcement learning.  And I have found a Koara answer on the difference between the two.  I'm not reading it now because I'll stop paying total attention to you and that would be bad.  This is an assignment for future research.  I will drop this in our chat if you care to learn.  Very interesting.  Oops.  Maybe I'll drop it in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I won't.  Well, so it says on that write up you just showed from the order, the first selling point is that it's a way to learn more about ML.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon also debuted a file system compatible with Windows called a WFX.  I think I lost the story.  I clicked the link, but I didn't get the story.  I'm sorry.  FSX, Amazon FSX for Windows file server to move customers from Microsoft to use Glacier Deep Archive as a cheaper data storage option coming in 2019.  This is according to Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazon targets hybrid cloud customers with on site servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if we're talking about big themes from AWS, not just cool like tiny announcements there, I think we're two or three that I thought were worthwhile.  And I don't know if you want to talk about this, but one is hybrid cloud.  It is the recognition that Amazon has all of these enterprise customers who want to have their own stuff running on their own data centers.  So there's a bunch of news around getting stuff to run together between their cloud and Amazon's cloud.  There's services like Direct Connect that are going to make it easier and cheaper to connect those things securely.  And so there's a bunch of stuff related to that.  Right.  Is Amazon stay right there for a second, Stacey.  Stay right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this like the old Google yellow box?  Are they selling the server that you use on your on your site or you could use other other equipment?  There is basically the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You run their software and it sinks the two.  It does more than sink.  I believe you can also like develop in those environments and also run them in production on the cloud.  Like there are lots of elements to this, but we'll just call it the ability to do it and keep it synced between places and to run it in both places and to develop in both places is kind of.  It reminds me of going back to the original like Netscape server days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a pendulum that swings back.  Yes.  Sorry, thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.  Is IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did a bunch of big announcements around IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should think about this IOT for industrial and enterprise customers.  So they did more security for Greengrass, which is an IOT product that sits at the edge.  And these all kind of fall also sort of into hybrid cloud if we want to think about that way, because they're also designed to run at the edge on someone's premise and in the cloud.  Oh, yeah.  They're also designed to run at the edge on someone's premise and in the cloud.  Oh, you can't see my other hand where I'm doing my edge in cloud.  Okay.  And so they did a security thing with Greengrass.  They did a couple like sensor analysis and pulling in sensor information and I can't remember what those are called.  Hold on.  It's like I've got like six Amazon screen tabs open.  I'm like, ah, I can't find that one.  It's like Insight, IOT Insight.  They also today announced a super fast time series database, which is really big in the industrial world, because that's where you're sending all this like, I'm at this and this is my temperature at this time.  Temperature, time, temperature, time, or just basic state, you know, time.  And there are two news announcements related to that.  And then they had their satellite service, which I feel is kind of an IOT thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then that's a weird thing because it's how big is the market for satellite?  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's interesting here.  It applies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a large market.  This is a software services for people who run satellites.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so basically it lets you if you're interested in satellite connectivity, it lets Amazon run that instead of you, which could be like an opening up of the market because beforehand you had to build your own.  Satellite station.  So think of like a smaller version of contact like the lab at Jodie Foster lives in and the movie contact.  So instead of doing that, you just buy it from Amazon, which means you could use satellite as a backup for maybe cellular in your connected car that you always want to be able to connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a platform for people who want to use this kind of connectivity.  Not for people who launch satellites.  In fact, satellite.  It's called AWS Ground.  Bezos will do that for you too, but just wait a little bit.  Apparently it's called AWS Ground Station.  And it's oh, this is what iridium has ended up doing.  All right.  It's a network of 12 satellite facilities around the world.  And so the ground station, basically it's a service.  It's satellite is a service.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Have we ever had the head of AWS, the CTO of Amazon on one of your shows?  We should get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verner?  Verner Fogel.  Verner doesn't do a lot of stuff anymore.  They don't.  So Verner is the sweetest, nicest, funniest man you will ever hang out with.  But he is also very prone to talking out of school.  So he doesn't, you don't see him in a lot of places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been with him in conferences in his homeland.  Yes.  In different language, I guess it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Delightful person.  Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wonderful.  Absolutely.  What a big bear of a man.  Yeah, he's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he, they put Matt Wood and Andrew Jassy are the people that they tend to put out into  the world nowadays.  And you should.  They're great to talk to.  They're both very smart and good to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So AWS ground station would remove the capital costs of building ground station networks  off satellite operations.  They've partnered with a number of companies, including Spire, which is a company that long  launches CubeSat, little tiny satellites.  They have 60 of them in orbit with multiple sensors.  They track ships and airplanes, gather atmospheric data to forecast weather.  Spire says, you know, that's just an offshoot of our real business, which is analytics.  But we had to put the satellites up.  They, the Spire guy said the same way we rent compute capacity on Amazon due to need, we'll  now be able to rent ground station capacity to suck data from our satellites on demand.  So I guess it is.  Oh, it is.  So here's how you should think of it.  They are working with Iridium as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So think about it this way.  So if you know the difference between I, okay, I'm just going to do it.  IAAS infrastructure as a service versus platforms as a service and versus software as a service.  So I just went up a stack there.  Amazon with AWS has the infrastructure as a service, plus they have platforms as a service  as well.  Salesforce is a software as a service.  So what Amazon is doing, the satellite providers are going to be the infrastructure.  So the servers are equal to satellites in this example.  Right.  And then Amazon with ground station is going to be this Paz layer that would be like a  Heroku or a pick another Paz layer in Amazon that I can't think of right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes me wonder why they don't launch satellites and do the whole stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a bunch of junk up there in space already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't need more.  I was talking with Iridium, which was originally launched to be a satellite phone network and  then went bankrupt.  Motorola launched them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But is this part of, is this Bezos' bigger picture with having a rocket company?  Well, but wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think it's the other way around.  I think this is Bezos.  Really all Amazon is is infrastructure as a service.  Initially it was selling stuff, but the infrastructure is, you know, half the stuff Amazon sells  on its website is not sold by Amazon.  They are fulfillment as a service.  It is infrastructure as a service.  That's why they have trucks.  That's why they have planes.  That's the way how they have warehouses there.  And so in addition to all of those, they also have satellite ground stations.  I guess that's enough of a business that they want to set that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All I'm saying is the Bezos has rockets.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not Amazon.  That's Bezos himself.  That's Bezos in Blue Origin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because he has so much money.  He doesn't know what to do with it.  So he started a sat or started a spaceship company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he also did a great prime deal with Washington Post, even though those are separate.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's there's definitely interconnects.  Yeah.  No, I think this is clever.  Maybe this is a better insight into what Jeff Bezos is.  Actual ambition is is just to say infrastructure as a service.  I think that's an interesting play.  So what interests me a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I was just going to say.  So the interesting thing about and I'm I did not come up with this, but what Amazon has done is it's created this platform, right, that it can deliver services on.  So be it infrastructure like satellites, be it servers, whatever.  And then it has a way to see what's happening on those services.  And what you see it do is when it sees something that it likes that a lot of people are using, it's like, oh, jump right on.  I'm going to build that.  So then it builds that.  But it builds it also as a platform.  So what it's basically doing is just building layers so it can see what's popular and then get in on that business.  And it's brilliant. It's data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. You create infrastructure as a service and then you use the resulting data to decide what other businesses to get into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're also creating API like Google, create APIs to all this ML stuff that people can't build.  So you're getting it's not software as a service so much as as as added services to the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and here's another thing they announced.  You haven't gotten all three. I'm going to guess that you're the third leg of the you said the first thing was I'm sorry.  Hybrid cloud cloud, hybrid cloud.  The second thing was IOT, which you could argue is industrial slash enterprise readiness for IOT.  What's the third one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arm servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it?  She's gotten excited.  I don't know what about the dams.  This is what I'm so excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arm based servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Arm based servers as her school as they're just hooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the last thing I would have thought Stacey would hoot about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know you guys are excited about the fish.  But guys, I have been waiting and waiting for like eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's talking about both Jeff and I are buying Amazon enabled Billy Bass, big mouth Billy Bass is that's really the level we're at.  Our level. Yeah.  And she's excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Stacey is up with the cloud up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Arm based servers.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's better than us.  We accept that.  I'm not better.  I'm just different.  Okay.  So this was exciting to me.  And I guess probably expanding the Alexa ecosystem is probably number four and legitimately it's probably number three and arm based servers is way down there.  But give it to me, y'all, because I have been waiting for this forever, which is the idea that instead of just using x86 based servers now using arm servers makes a lot more sense, especially when we start talking about things like  virtual machines.  So when we started talking about virtual machines way back in like, I don't know, was it 2008 to 2006? Six, I guess is when they launched.  It started to make sense because you didn't actually need these massive cores to run these small little spin ups of compute jobs.  So that's when this idea of lower powered and optimizing performance per watt.  So creating more efficient data centers came in an arm as a way to do this.  But, man, it took forever.  We had to get to like 30 and we went from 32 bit arm based cores.  We had to get 64 bit base cores.  Then we had to get chip designers to build it.  But the big implicate and then we had to get people like Amazon to use it, which is why this is such a big deal.  So Amazon's now using it.  Baidu uses it.  I think Microsoft may use some arm based servers for some of their stuff.  This has to make Intel crazy.  Exactly, because there's two things here.  One, there's a viable for some workloads competitor to Intel.  And I'm sorry, AMD, I love you so much.  But most weeks you are not a viable competitor.  Right now, their current generation is.  But also people can license this arm architecture and build totally different style chips based on it, which means you can optimize for different workloads.  And that's a big deal.  OK, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you not think that AIML, RL also are a big prong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, those are huge.  That's why Nvidia has been able to get into the data center.  Now there is.  There are not still that many workloads right now.  You still have and I would love to actually, I don't know if anyone does this, divides up the types of workloads there.  Like if you think about like transactional database workloads versus, you know, just straight up spinning up an EC2 instance versus machine learning or, you know, encoding, decoding, all of those things are very specific jobs.  And I don't know what percentage of jobs could be done on arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Amazon also announced in Ferentia.  This is exciting to a machine learning reference chip to compete with Google's TPU or Nvidia.  The cost and speed of the speed and cost of running machine learning operations are a competitive differentiator for enterprises.  Speed advantages will make or break successive enterprises and nations.  When you think of warfare, this speed can only be achieved with custom hardware and in Ferentia is AWS's first step to get into this game.  That's Holger Mueller, who's an analyst with Constellation Research talking to TechCrunch.  In Ferentia, I don't know anything about any of this stuff, but it does support TensorFlow, which is Google's.  And Cafe.  And Cafe too.  It supports all the big ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is again infrastructure as a service, right?  This is but it's machine language, machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a chip.  So it's a chip that's going to run presumably best using Amazon SageMaker and other AI stuff.  But it will also run these others.  And the idea here is to get the lowest cost, basically to optimize your thing.  So it's either low cost or it does jobs faster, which I guess turns into low cost or is more efficient.  So it costs Amazon less to run these models for their clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also announced Amazon's Elastic Inference Engine.  If they really had said something like Elastic Inference Engine Open, they could have called it EIEIO, which would have been, I think, better.  But they missed a bet on that one.  But the Elastic Inference Engine.  Something to fish would be fun to say.  Uses, let's users attach GPU powered inference acceleration to any EC2 instance to reduce deep learning cost by 75 percent.  So a lot of deep learning AI stuff in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing that excites me in media is Amazon personalization.  Amazon personalize.  What's that?  So that makes their personalization services available as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their personalization services are not like blowing me out of the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that where they say people like you bought also bought the Big Math Billy Bass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but imagine, you know, I've been arguing for media people to be doing this for years and we don't because we think that everybody wants the same one product we make.  Personalization across recommendations of all sorts.  It's a recommendation engine and there's huge opportunity around recommendation.  If you do it right.  Nobody's able been able to do it right.  And Stacey has a point that their Amazon's personalization surprisingly given all the data they have is not the best.  In fact, they got rid.  I'm still pissed at them.  About six months ago, they got rid of the personalized recommendations for me.  And now it's all mixed into everything they do.  And it's not as good before.  It was much more straightforward.  Here's what we recommend to you.  Here's why.  And I could have an impact on that.  And I missed that.  So nonetheless, personalization is a score is as a service isn't done well most of anywhere.  Now the issue is where does the data come from?  Is a GDPR compliant?  You know, what do you have permission to do this?  The way they describe it, you provide the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're just providing the hardware, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're providing the hardware and the ML.  Yeah.  The backs it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says you create a schema describing your data set.  You create a data set group for building the model.  You send the data to personalize.  It then creates a solution and a campaign.  Here's Amazon Polly.  Explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we know about Polly?  Oh, yes.  Polly's been there forever.  It's been out for a while.  But it's used to read this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon personalize.  Real-time personalization and recommendation for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds a little bit like you.  I think you're replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Machine learning definitely offers a wide range of exciting topics to work on.  It's not as happy as it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just an announcer voice.  That's all it is.  I can do that too.  Amazon personalize.  But I can't do it as cheaply as Polly.  I expected Polly to have a female voice.  I must confess.  Well, go to Polly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to that link on Polly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You want Joanna?  Hello.  Do you speak a foreign language?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  One language is never enough.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks.  That's how about Vitaya?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daya in Danish, I think.  Wait.  Did I just get insulted by a robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you took it.  You took it.  But I don't think this is as good as Google's voices, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google has so many.  All color coded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's hear the French one.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you speak another language than French?  One language is never enough.  She's going to scold me.  She sounds good.  It does sound more condescending in French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything sounds more condescending in French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, your robot is lonely.  She's exploring.  He or it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are exploring.  Amazon gets into the blockchain.  They said they never do it.  But they're going to do it.  Yes.  Last year, they said, we're not going to do a blockchain.  But today, according to TechCrunch, the company announced a new service called Amazon Quantum  Ledger Database, QLDB, which is a fully managed ledger database with a central trusted authority.  I thought the whole point of blockchain was decentral.  But OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have it two ways.  One of the services that supports QLDB is their managed blockchain service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is, it's immutable, append only, tracks the history of all changes, cryptographically  chained and verifiable.  And that's really kind of, I think, the key to blockchain, right?  And all of that doesn't have to be decentralized.  It also announced a managed blockchain service.  It'll be really scalable, says AWS CEO Andy Jassy.  OK.  That's not all.  It's all just all I understand.  And some of that I don't really even understand.  Wait, we haven't talked about the fish yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big Mouth Billy Bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that it?  Did they announce that today?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  It was on the list of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fish is on the list?  Yeah.  Your fish is on my list.  Your fish is on my list.  I ordered one immediately.  But we've disappointed to learn that the Big Mouth...  This was, it was a meme, wasn't it, Karsten?  We saw a video of it and it was fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  No, it was a hack.  Someone had hacked, basically just hacked the voice recognition of an old school Big Mouth Billy Bass.  Which would have been better.  To speak when a big mouth Billy Bass spoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now they have an Echo.  It's basically an Echo speaker that's a Billy Bass.  With a moving mouth.  With lip sync.  Yes.  Yeah, it's called the Big Mouth Billy Bass with a 39.99 pre-order, delivers December 1st or released December 1st.  But if you look more closely, you have to pair an existing Amazon Echo device to that as a Bluetooth speaker and then it will sing to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know why they did it this way.  Because Amazon in September introduced something called ACK Connect Kit.  And with that, what you could do is pop that module in.  And it would have actually if it had a mic in it, so you would have to have a mic in the Billy Bass, not just a speaker.  It would be, you could talk to it and it would be a standalone Echo device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that increase the cost to about a hundred bucks though?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got lots of things.  I mean, they're selling a dot for 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone's favorite talking and singing fish now responds to Amazon Echo voice commands.  Just pair Big Mouth Billy Bass with your preferred device in the Amazon Echo family and let the fun begin.  Who ever thought this would be back?  I don't understand why it happened in the first place.  And dances to the beat with Amazon Music.  Don't worry, be happy.  Big Mouth Billy Bass automatically updates with upgrades so he always has the most current capabilities.  It's so weird.  Big Mouth Billy Bass, he's back and better than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  They stopped making him.  It was a fad, Jeff.  You could only find them at the clearance house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So next we're going to have the Pet Rock with a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well let's start thinking.  I have one of those.  Those speaking spells with a...  You could have a...  What are those?  Pull string dollies with a...  You could just go on and on and on.  Teddy Ruxpin will be back next year.  Teddy Ruxpin, yeah that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Billy Bass, you're right.  So this thing uses something called a lot of gadgets.  And it's the gadget kit.  And basically it turns any sort of thing, it gives it the ability to talk to and recognize, like do notifications and help you with anything that you can tie to Alexa.  So that's if you want to build your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could take a Big Mouth Billy Bass and put a Raspberry Pi behind it or something and have it and put the Amazon Echo voice services on it.  Yeah.  I don't know how the lip sync works.  Yeah, something cheap.  But I don't know how the lip sync works.  So Arduino will work with the Amazon voice services kit?  Yeah, not the gadget kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the gadget kit is different than ConnectKit.  ConnectKit is just the Wi-Fi and a link back to the IoT core hub, whatever Amazon calls their IoT service.  How do you get the lip sync to work?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can only go so far, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can only do so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's time for you guys to do some heavy lifting.  All right.  We're going to take a break and then I'll do some heavy lifting.  Is there Google News to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have we covered, is there anything else that the Amazon reInvent announced that we missed?  Probably.  Yes, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But nothing else that we have to know about today.  No, because you guys gave me my arm servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So thank you.  Arm servers.  You're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that'll be arm servers on AWS.  So you could use arm.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait.  I lied to you.  Amazon, do you care about their Cyber Monday press release that was basically, we sold a  ton of devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to get to that.  I don't consider that reInvent news.  That's just general Amazon we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's the other line of business they have.  Yeah.  Another thing we do, selling stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember that?  And we'll talk about the day one fund and the Black Friday protest.  There's other Amazon news.  That's for sure.  But take a deep breath.  I want to talk about WordPress, which is blogging as a service.  Blah.  Actually, it's the best way.  I think blogging is really not, is a small fraction of what you can do with WordPress.com.  That's what I do with it and have done for more than a decade.  But WordPress.com really is about making a website that reflects your company's brand,  your aesthetic, a place for teenagers to put their best work so that when people Google  their name, their WordPress.com site shows up, not that video that their enemy shot of  them in the back rooms at the school smoking cigarettes or whatever.  You want to control your reputation on the web.  Whether you're a teenager, an adult, or a business, you got to have a home on the web.  I mean, it's just that simple.  Everybody needs a website and WordPress is the easiest place to do it.  I have to say WordPress.com takes care of all the boring stuff, the hosting, the security,  the software updates.  You focus on what you do best, your stuff, your content.  You could choose from hundreds of designs to match your vision, establish your brand,  no matter how much design experience you have.  At WordPress.com, it's my home on the net.  You can have a Facebook page, you can have an Instagram account, you can have a Twitter  account, but you don't own any of those.  You own your WordPress site.  Upload images, video, and audio to the WordPress site.  Ever since I closed my social media, that's where I put all my stuff.  And unlike posting it on somebody else's site, you never lose control of it.  You can export content to and import to your WordPress site, export from it.  It's your site, it's your home, it's your content.  You own it.  It's so important to me.  Everybody at least has to have a website.  You know, if a baby's born, you've got friends in the family or friends or family who just  had a baby, get them a WordPress site with the baby's name, set that up.  That's something that kid will grow up with and 20 years from now will take over and that  will have been their thing, their site.  What a great gift that would be.  Grow your audience.  If you're a business, you'll reach new customers.  Built-in search engine optimization so you show up at the top of Google.  Social media features so your customers, your readers can share your content, your business  on their Facebook site, on their Twitter page, on their Instagram.  Marketing tools that will help you grow.  And with the WordPress app, I love the WordPress app, iOS or Android.  Actually, it's on desktops too.  You can manage your site on the go.  I used it to post as I was traveling around Europe, but I also use it to approve comments,  check viewer stats, things like that.  Of course, the best part about WordPress is 24-7 support.  It's there when you need it and a price that is right.  As little as $4 a month.  I do the, I think it's a $100 business plan.  I love it.  It is awesome.  32% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.  Find out why.  Go to WordPress.com slash twig.  Get 15% off any new plan purchase.  WordPress.com slash twig.  WordPress.com slash twig.  Create your beautiful, fantastic, wonderful site.  WordPress.com slash twig to get 15% off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you played with Gutenberg yet, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I use it.  That's the new editing platform for content that you create on your WordPress site.  And yeah, I like it.  I know it's been a little bit, this is my WordPress site.  It's been a little controversial, but.  I haven't tried it yet.  Yeah, it's great.  How is it controversial?  Oh, because if you change, oh, that guy just almost walked off the table, but he didn't.  If you change your anything, anywhere on the web, it's controversial, right?  Yes, exactly.  Nobody will be happy.  Oh, look at the old stick shift way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is this automatic transmission thing?  I want a double clench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll log in and show you, but it's, you know, it's just another, it's an, I don't actually,  I use the app, so I don't really see it that much.  But if you do, if you want to post on the WordPress site, you will, you'll see Gutenberg.  I just needed an excuse to take it.  You just like the name.  I know.  You just want, you just like the name.  That's the real reason.  Yeah, no, it's fine.  I really like the backend on WordPress, but like I said, I've been using it for more than  a decade.  I'm so comfortable with it.  It's just natural.  Just easy for me.  I think that's really the secret to the whole thing.  It's a lot better than blogger.  God, we've come a long way, haven't we?  Wow.  I used so many platforms when I first started out.  There was one called Grey Matter.  I remember Type, what was it?  Type?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Type Pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there was Dave Weiner's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never used, I never used Frontier.  Frontier, right.  Although that looked, the principle is very, very cool.  I did use Type Pad and then they had Vox.  They created Vox.  That was an example of, I did not own that site because when Vox went out of business,  I lost a lot of my images.  I was able to get the text out, but those images were hosted on Vox.  See, that's why I really like the idea of, you know, I can, and I back up regularly.  My WordPress site is always safe on my hard drives as well as on their servers.  And they make that very easy to do.  Let's talk about Cyber Monday.  Silly name.  The premise used to be that everybody would wait to shop online until they were at work,  where they had fast internet connections.  Now most people have faster internet connections at home.  In fact, billions of dollars in goods sold Thanksgiving Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Amazon came up with a new thing, but I don't know if we should talk about it yet.  I told Jeff.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're calling it the Turkey Five.  Oh, a name I refuse to condone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like naming storms that aren't hurricanes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The five shopping days that start with Thanksgiving and continue through Cyber Monday.  Broke records.  Which I say.  U.S. consumers bought millions more products over that period compared with that period last year.  18 million. This is all from Amazon.  18 million toys on Black Friday.  13 million fashion. Oh, I'm sorry.  Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.  13 million fashion items.  Sales.  This is Amazon's information.  The other one to look at, of course, Adobe Analytics.  They have global information.  The shopping event, Cyber Monday, for Amazon anyway, was the biggest shopping day in the company's history.  They saw more stuff Monday than they did on Black Friday or even on Prime Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how that compares to Alibaba or Baidu on Singles Day.  And I wish that, I mean, Amazon's, their press releases are just pointless in the sense that there's no real data to be had there.  But that's, if I could find out, that's the question I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we could probably find out. Let's see. According to Adobe, Cyber Monday sales were 7.9 billion online.  That is, I think, a fraction of Singles Day. Yeah, 30 billion on Singles Day for Alibaba.  So one merchant in China, Alibaba, sold more on one day than all merchants, three times more on one day than all merchants in the U.S. or worldwide, I guess.  I don't know. Cyber Monday is a global phenomenon, right? Foot traffic at some malls and stores was down over the holiday weekend.  That's because more and more people are shopping online. It's a 19% increase year over year for Cyber Monday.  Black Friday, $6.22 billion. Again, this is not just Amazon. This is all online.  But the weirdest thing to me was that online sales on Thanksgiving Day were $3.7 billion.  $1 billion of it from phones. So what's the scenario? You go to the families to have turkey or bored to tears.  You sneak off in a corner while Uncle Joe's snoring on the Barca Lounge or the football game's on and you buy some stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. It's the new cigarette break. It's cigarette break. Amazon break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or if you're Leo Laporte, you get excited and say, I have to buy that fish now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is why I'm an outlier because my sales, the line of sales doesn't really peak at any point. It just continues. Solid buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the other interesting thing about this is this is the first Christmas without Toys R Us. So I put it on the on the rundown chat.  Amazon said it sold 18 million toys between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. It had been stockpiling toys since Toys R Us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guess who put Toys R Us out of business? Yeah. Well, Toys R Us and Walmart and loaded them up with debt.  Yeah, it wasn't Amazon actually, but they're certainly reaping the benefit of it. Wow.  Kohl's had a record day for digital sales on Thanksgiving. Walmart and Target also strong online sales.  Some customers, a lot of customers opting to buy online and pick up in store. I never will understand that.  But you see these ads all the time for Walmart because you don't pay for shipping then and you get it that day. You know that day, right?  Yeah, it's just a way to reserve something. Yeah. Is that online sales? They count that. I think so.  Anyway, it was, you know, I guess if honestly if you want to say how strong the economy is, this is the best way to the best stat to quote.  People are confident they're going to buy more and we're seeing massive increases year over year from last year in online sales.  Thursday was the first day in 2018 all of the year to see a billion dollars in sales from smartphones, according to Adobe.  Shoppers spent 8% more online on Thanksgiving Day compared to a year ago, growth of 8%.  So I think that's one of the stories. Black Friday is not the only day anymore. It is the Turkey Five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did Adobe end up in the shopping data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, but this is the big, you know, of the last few years, it's Adobe Analytics every time.  No, that's true. It's a weird new business for them relatively now.  You know, there's really nothing to say about this. I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a fun. I mean, it's better connectivity. It's mobile phones. It's the ability to buy things.  And I don't know about you guys, but the number of pitches from companies and number of emails I got related to sales in the preceding week were just obscene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me too.  Meanwhile, Amazon workers went on strike on Black Friday.  We are not robots. Unions for the warehouse employees called working conditions inhuman. Amazon disagrees.  This was particularly big in those communist countries of UK, Spain, Italy and Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are not robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We are not. We are not. We are not.  Actually, they may regret saying that. We could be robots, honest.  I'm sure they'll be replaced by robots.  So it wasn't mass protests. Union officials said they expected about 2,600 workers would show up.  So, but it got some news. It got some air time.  I think I think we have now literally tapped all of the Amazon. Amazon day is over.  Amazon Turkey is dead. It is.  Turkey five are done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they sold out of Echo Dots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sold out. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true, though.  Can I buy one right now?  I bet you could. They're making them fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are saying that the new Echo Dots sound really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do. I actually was going to buy another like a new Echo Dot to replace my other one.  And then I realized I had a Google Hub. So I just use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have so many Echo Dots. I don't want to replace them.  But mostly now I use them because they're so tinny. I use them just play to something else.  Maybe my big mouth Billy Bass when time comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the new ones right now instead of their their thirty dollars instead of they were twenty five dollars.  So, you know, pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't Amazon. Yep.  I think there's big news around Google five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is good news, but I think it's I'm going to save it for the change log.  Oh, sorry. OK, no, that's OK.  But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we step on your stuff all the time.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The change log is a little bit sparse today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, I need everything I can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need all the changes I can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we talked about this on this weekend tech on Sunday?  But I brought it up to you guys and I don't know what you think about it.  Washington, according to The Wall Street Journal, and they don't say who in Washington, the US government.  So this could be intelligence agencies.  It could be the White House.  It could be the Commerce Department.  I don't know, has initiated an extraordinary for all I know.  It could be Brett Kavanaugh.  I don't know, has initiated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies, says the journal,  trying to persuade wireless and Internet providers in these countries to avoid telecommunications equipment from Huawei.  They're going to Germany, Italy and Japan.  Although the Italian response was, yeah, well, we don't like to use Huawei, but there's not really anything else.  We cannot ignore Huawei because they're a leading telecom equipment provider worldwide.  And it's a very tough call, said one Italian official.  So you remember in 2012, Congress put out a warning that Chinese networking gear might not be safe to use.  Last year, the Commerce Department said we warned us about Huawei ZTE, both Chinese companies that have some connection to the Chinese military.  Huawei in particular was founded by a former Chinese military officer.  Huawei is the number two phone manufacturer in the world after Samsung, the number one networking gear manufacturer in the world.  And they are the number one by far maker of 5G networking gear.  The fear, according to the journal, and I think it's a reasonable fear, is the Chinese telecom equipment used in the United States or our allies could be used,  A, to spy on companies either for industrial espionage or military espionage, and B, could have a kill switch built in and as part of a cyber attack or a cyber war could be used to shut down the networks and disable the information networks in these countries.  The US is considering increasing, not doing it, just thinking, we're thinking about increasing financial aid for telecommunications development in countries that shun Chinese-made equipment.  And of course, maybe US companies too, but that's the problem.  Yeah, so there's only like four of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's Cisco, is it Ericsson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ericsson and Nokia are big players in this.  Is Nokia still its own company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can never remember, like there was Alcatel, but that got bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's listed as Nokia, but who actually owns it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's probably, then it's still Nokia. Yeah, there's like Cisco, Nokia, and Ericsson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's it.  And Huawei, but Huawei is number one.  What do you think? Now, see, on the one hand, because they don't say which government officials, this could easily be a campaign on the part of the administration as part of a trade war with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is this, I feel like our administration has lost so much credibility.  I can't tell if this is like part of like the crazy Trump China thing that he's got, or if this is legit.  There, I mean, Huawei has had this complaint lodged against it for years, and they have up until now.  Now, it's been just a complaint.  So it's unclear to me if anything, like if they found material information and something's really changed, or if this is just more, this is an escalation of that rhetoric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's, we could be quick to point out there's a ton of gear made by other Chinese companies that's in the market today.  And there's even more stuff made by US companies in China, including the iPhone.  So I don't know where you find this made in America, built in America, safe to use stuff.  And by the way, one can also, I mean, this is, in a way, this is a trade war.  I mean, I'm sure that there are legitimate security issues, but it is a trade war because, of course, what's the response from China?  Well, don't buy American equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Trump threatened, wouldn't be wrong to say that.  Yes, and Trump threatened a 10% tariff on iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not a political move, smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was, yeah, that was just strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think part of the problem in that case is that the president doesn't really understand that tariffs don't mean money in the pocket of the consumer.  They mean money out of the pocket of consumers.  I don't think he understands that.  But, you know, that's neither here nor there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could spend the whole show trying to figure out what Trump does and does not understand.  I'm like, let's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've seen a number of statements from the administration, not just the president, but others in the administration that really imply they don't get it.  Oh, a tariff, that balances our trade.  You know, we take that money and we have it, now we have a trade balance.  No, that's not how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, economics is hard.  They call it the dismal science for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he said today he has a better gut than brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll go.  Yeah.  Have you seen the junk food he eats?  I will grant you that.  So that's it's unfortunate because you're right.  We live in an age where there actually probably are legitimate security threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's certainly a reason to worry.  Yeah.  But or there's a reason to investigate.  Let me rephrase that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some doubt Koudis cast on this because of the political environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, maybe they really did find something and that would be really worth knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  But that's I think what needs to go.  If you're going to talk about the you know, if you're going to castigate Bloomberg for its super micro story, this is even more so.  I'd love to see the evidence.  And I do think that if Huawei were doing this, that there would be some physical or software evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you would you would have to see it in the code.  Yeah.  I mean, when Verizon and AT&T buy this gear, they test the heck out of it and they test the heck out of it with the vendors.  So like I've been inside test test facilities for these guys.  And this is not this is like years long efforts.  And I feel like especially a company like AT&T, which is like right next to the U.S.  government and cozy cozy, they're not going to screw this over.  I don't actually know if they're using Huawei equipment, though.  So that is they likely are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Australia has banned Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks in October.  UK authorities say they were reviewing the makeup of its telecom equipment.  New Zealand has blocked Huawei imports over a significant security risk.  So it's my guess there is a smoking gun.  I feel you know, it's I'm a little this is why I don't ever like to talk to PR people.  I met and talked to for some time the VP of Public Relations for Huawei Devices, U.S.  Oh, Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a woman.  Oh, OK.  It used to be a man.  Bill's corporate, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  She's Huawei Devices, U.S.  So anyway, she said because she I felt bad because I had a P 20, which is a really nice phone.  And then she had the brand new Huawei Mate 20, which is a gorgeous, the most beautiful phone you've ever seen.  Really an amazing phone, which you can't get in the U.S.  The only country in the world you can't get either of these because and you probably remember this last year at CES Verizon and AT&T announced  pre announced they were going to carry these phones.  Then we're told by the U.S.  government it would be a bad idea.  And you remember the Huawei guy coming on stage at CES being livid because it basically destroyed their plans to sell the phone in the U.S.  She told me we just don't want to spend marketing money in the U.S.  selling something if it doesn't have a carrier contract, because that's how phones are sold in the U.S.  Without a carrier relationship, you're just not going to sell it.  So they yanked the phone, but they still sell their laptop.  Their Huawei Matebook laptop is a gorgeous laptop, a really nice laptop.  I was playing with it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right after that or soon after that, January 16th, 2018, there's a Reuters story by a different reporter, almost the same headline, except this one cites two congressional aides.  So knowing that that's the source, that feels much more politically motivated.  Right.  Although they cite national security concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's completely legitimate.  It's also if that's the case, it's a challenge to come up with something that doesn't have a national security concern because we don't make this stuff here in the U.S.  very much anymore.  I guess you could trust the Swedish company Ericsson and the Finnish company Ericsson and the Swedish company Nokia.  Nokia is Finnish.  Nokia is Finnish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nokia is Finnish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nokia is Finnish and Ericsson is Swedish.  Oh, it's Swedish now?  Okay.  It's based in Stockholm, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so yes.  It's based in Espoo.  I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was Nokia.  That was Nokia.  Nokia is headquartered in Espoo.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.  Never second guess, Stacey Higginbotham.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I remember having to write Espoo based Nokia when I was writing about handsets for the 20 seconds that I wrote about handsets.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there you go.  I keep bringing this story up and nobody seems to really have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had the smoking gun, Leo, I would tell you I want the smoking gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Leo, have you made a reservation using Duplex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, have you?  Well, so I just was trying to I was turning down the mic and trying to do it.  So you go to assistant on your pixels.  It's only available in certain markets.  Well, no, they've expanded it.  So I went to my pixel.  I went to assistant.  I asked for a certain restaurant and then it had the picture.  I asked for a restaurant and then it had the button you want, which is make a reservation.  Then it said, guess what?  You can't do that with this account.  But you might be able to do it.  So how should I so I should say to go to assistant, go to assistant, ask for a restaurant.  You know, when you know that takes a reservation in San Francisco.  No, what I would do is ask for a specific restaurant because then you're going to have a you're going to have the restaurant box and below that it's going to ask you, do you want to make a reservation at this restaurant?  So plug one of your favorite restaurants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make a reservation at Kokari restaurant, San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may not give you the box.  It may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, for two people.  For when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tomorrow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At what time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what if I don't really want a reservation?  You can cancel it.  You can cancel it.  Just keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, what's the phone number for this booking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to do it.  I don't know what the phone.  Oh, my phone.  It's your phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say this number.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  6 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I couldn't find any tables around 6 p.m.  Please try again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's just using OpenTable or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's using OpenTable in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what you wanted to do is make a call for you.  Yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to find a restaurant that doesn't use OpenTable.  It's still pretty cool, although that's kind of a long process.  It's actually not a great voice first use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I guess I could, though.  Let's try this.  Make a restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you were an announcer for a living.  I'm not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make a reservation for a party of two 7 p.m.  at Acarello Restaurant San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While I can't make reservations at that particular restaurant,  here's their phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody know a restaurant in San Francisco that's not on OpenTable?  Good luck finding that.  Anyway, what about Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  All right.  I'll bet they don't have OpenTable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make a restaurant reservation for the Shuckery Petaluma tomorrow at 7 p.m.  Table for two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got it. Let's make a reservation with OpenTable for 7 p.m.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll see you at the Shuckery tomorrow at 7 p.m.  It'll be a fine birthday dinner for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't want it.  So that's okay.  So what we're trying to get to is that Google Duplex thing that they demonstrated at Google I.O.  where that semi-human sounding voice will make a reservation for you on the phone.  Here, let's, VentureBeat did it and we can play their video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make a restaurant reservation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I found some choices.  Which place do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cafe Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I should have go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds good.  I'll call to make a reservation at Cafe Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For how many?  I wish you could listen.  Two people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you do.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe you can.  For when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I presume you can jam all that information together just to save time.  7 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds good for 7 p.m. on Friday.  Just in case that's not available, can I try between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it for 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I have a phone number here ending in 8 3 2 1.  Can I use that to book the reservation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  This is a lot slower and more painful than just doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I'll look under Kyle with the phone number ending in 8 3 2 1.  Should I try to book?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine you're driving, Leo.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I'll try calling them now and update you within the next 15 minutes.  You can always ask me about your reservation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder how Cafe Istanbul feels when this thing calls them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe the reporter called them and asked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently not.  Because that video just ended.  A spokesperson confirmed to VentureBeat that Duplex has expanded from, quote,  a set of trusted users, quote, end quote, to a small group of Google Pixel phone  owners who can now use Duplex via the Assistant to secure restaurant  reservations in select cities.  Presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't do it because I have a Google G Suite account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, neither can Mr. J.  New York, Atlanta, Phoenix, San Francisco.  If you're not in the trusted tester group, you'll likely get an error along the lines of  sorry, I can't call to make reservations for you yet, but here's their phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  All right, we try.  So maybe you're just not in the group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I didn't know because I didn't get to a restaurant that didn't have other ways to do it.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Should I try Cafe Istanbul?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure they have lots of reservations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make a reservation for Cafe Istanbul tomorrow night, 7 p.m.  Party of two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here it is.  Kitchen Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all they gave me.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I'm not.  Do you have a place closer to you called Kitchen Istanbul?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then Cafe Istanbul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know where this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many Turkish restaurants are there out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Istanbul, Wisconsin, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's called Kitchen Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's in San Francisco.  Maybe it's not Cafe Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says Cafe Istanbul is closed, like permanently.  I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a ghost restaurant and they're making calls to it from a ghost.  All right, let's take a break.  I want to do the changelog.  I can't hold it any longer, my friends.  So right after this.  You're bursting with changelog.  I'm bursting with changelog news.  Good spirits of changelog tide.  But first a word about privacy.com.  I love to use privacy.  In fact, I'm going back now through previous charges online and replacing my regular credit card on those systems with a privacy card.  And I'll tell you why privacy is the only card I use online.  It's free.  Used by 400,000 users.  And what it is, it's a credit card, it's a Visa card, but it's tied to your debit or checking account.  Here's the best part.  Once you use a privacy card at any individual merchants, it's locked to that merchant.  No one else can use that card.  So if that card is stolen, no big deal.  If the number is exfiltrated, as it were, and we know breaches happen, no big deal.  Anybody, nobody else can use it.  You can when you create.  In fact, let me create a new card just to show you the process.  It's really easy.  You can nickname the card.  I'm going to make this be for a, let's see, who do I want to replace?  Oh, I know what I need to do.  I think my subscription for the Wall Street Journal ran out.  So Wall Street Journal.  So you nickname the card.  It will suggest a logo if it's something that it knows, but it doesn't have, you don't have to have a logo.  Who cares?  You can set a spend limit.  So I know that that subscription is not going to cost me more than $100 a month, or I could say per charge, or I could say per year, or total.  So you could say, you know what?  This is going to be used and it's going to be used once for $100 and never again.  Or there's no limit at all.  There is a single use button.  If you want to click that, it will also say it can only be used once for this amount.  And then you create a card.  Now, I am going to show you this card because you can't use it.  Ha ha ha ha.  Actually, I better kill that card right now.  So there's a number.  There's a sub.  By the way, I love this part.  It gives you a a trans a expiration date that's five years in the future, which is great.  So you don't have to worry about it for five years.  But here's the best part.  If I use the fact I'm going to trash this card right now.  So don't try to use it.  That's gone.  So that that card you saw, it's gone.  This is the one I created last time.  Unnamed burner.  But I use it for Hulu.  I use it for subscriptions.  I use it for everything because you never have to worry about a subscription going on and on and on and on.  You can pause, freeze or delete the card at any time.  It's no longer good.  They're PCI DSS compliant.  That's the same security standards as your bank.  All your information is secured using military grade encryption.  Split key encryption with partial keys held by separate employees, kind of like in the war games.  So no single person in privacy can access the data.  The cards let you use.  I love this.  Any billing info you like.  So if you want to use a card and not give the merchant your address or zip code, use whatever you want.  Privacy will approve the charge, but the merchant will not get your address or your zip code.  They also support two factor, which of course I use to log in.  Now I am sorry to say is only available in the US right now.  It costs you nothing to use because of course, like any credit card, they make money from their merchants.  They won't sell your information.  There are no hidden fees.  I love it that subscriptions are now in my command.  There's a browser extension in the Chrome Web Store you can use.  They have an Android or iOS app.  You saw how easy it was to create an app on the website as well.  You link your virtual cards to your US checking account or your debit card account.  So it's not a charge card.  There's no interest.  It takes the money out of your account right away.  That's something you should be aware of.  But oh man, I love this.  You don't ever have to worry about being billed twice or upgraded without your consent.  You can totally send a limit.  And in fact, if the merchant gets hacked, you'll probably know before they do because you'll get that decline email or push notification.  I have those turned on.  The minute somebody tries to use that card somewhere else, privacy says that's the card you linked to Amazon.  Somebody's trying to use it at Walmart.  And it'll decline, of course.  So you never have to worry.  This is the only card I use online now.  And it's definitely the only card I use for subscriptions.  I didn't even mention you can get cash back up to five percent cash back.  This is such a great solution.  I don't know why everybody's not using it.  Privacy.com.  There's no cost to you.  It keeps your money safe.  And you have total control over that credit card.  I literally use it now almost exclusively.  And as I said, I'm going back to all my online accounts and replacing the real credit card that they have with my privacy card.  It's that good.  Privacy.com.  Oh, if you go to I should give you one more little treat just for the holidays.  Privacy.com slash twig.  That way they know you saw it here on This Week in Google and you'll get a five dollar credit on your first purchase.  I know it's not a huge amount.  It's just a little something to thank you.  Privacy.com slash twig.  I'm a big fan.  It was inevitable.  Price comparison sites are now complaining to the EU that Google is flouting the EU competition rules favoring their sites.  This is an ongoing battle.  This is the one isn't the one Google lost for the 2.4 billion euro fine.  And now.  I believe so.  And now 14 rivals have sent a letter to the European Commissioner for Compensation.  Sorry, competition.  Margarita Vestal here saying, hey, they're not they're not complying with your your order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We come back to the problem.  Some of these some of these things can be decent comparison sites and some of them can be crap sites that are just link farms.  Yeah.  And so who's to judge?  I have long argued that Google should have a jury of business peers to judge rather than themselves since Google has the power of God in these cases.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Foundem, which is the company that originally brought the complaint against Google in 2010, is one of those 14 sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to find the others in the letter.  Well, there are a chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A share dot com price runner.  I deal.  Rado.  Comparado.  If Google fails to comply with the commission's decision, it would be liable for noncompliance payments of up to five percent of the average daily worldwide revenue of Alphabet backdated to the start of noncompliance.  Five percent of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was only four percent.  Oh, wait, no, this is under a court thing.  Not GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is this is also a penalty.  Right.  Five percent of revenue.  That's some money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would not want that.  So this is I guess they did record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Going back to this duplex thing.  Here is audio of Google Duplex making a restaurant order.  I don't know if this is from the Google I.O. demo.  No, this is new.  This is real.  Hello, Kathy.  Brad.  I'm going to make a reservation for a client and call from Google for the call.  May I have your number?  Can I book a table for tomorrow, please?  Oh, I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I like that Irish accent.  That adds a certain verisimilitude.  How did it identify itself again?  I'm calling from Google so this call may be recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it didn't say, it says I am calling on behalf of a client.  It didn't say I'm calling on behalf of a client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm calling from Google.  But it didn't say I'm a robot.  But that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, at what time would you like to reserve?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  At 7 p.m.  Okay, perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people?  It's for two people.  Okay, two people tomorrow at 7 p.m.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's your name?  My first name is Anna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anna, okay, thank you.  Okay.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It doesn't sound like Anna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Boy, it's pretty realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were no ahs.  But there were pauses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were pauses.  And I like, I mean, some of this kind of awkwardness, I mean, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I mean, some of this kind of thrown away like, okay, I thought that was quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she had an accent, which would be perfect.  Yeah.  Not a very heavy one, but a rather charming accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In that recording, which was an actual call that, you know, I guess they ran over to the  restaurant and said, hey, Google's going to call you.  Let's record.  In the call we recorded, it says Venture Beat, the wording has changed from the original  duplex ad of last year, removing the part that makes it crystal clear it's not a human  calling.  Okay, I'm calling to make a reservation for a client.  I'm calling from Google so the call may be recorded.  That actually might have been a human operator.  So, this is an update that, wow, this is interesting.  Venture Beat just put out an update.  At this stage, some duplex calls are made using Google's automated system.  Others are conducted using human operators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is like Facebook's M.  You will never know.  And remember how poorly that went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The former announced that they are automated up front.  So, this was a real person.  We were fooled by the fooling.  Oh, geez.  Human operators don't say that.  They just say they're calling from Google.  Hi, Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a job at Google.  Great.  Are you going to make weapons?  No, I'm just going to call and make reservations.  So, that was a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's no fun.  What a waste of time.  You don't like humans.  Edit this out.  Humans.  Humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't want humans.  We've seen humans do act as assistants for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's nothing special about that.  I don't want a human to make fun of.  Sora, have you now read the many reviews of the slate, Jeff Jarvis?  No, I have not.  And are you thinking about it?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dieter Bone had one.  Kevin wants you to read his because he feels that most of them hated it, but they were  not actual Chromebook users.  That is all I have to say.  He spent a large portion of time talking to me about it this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's his site, All Chromebooks?  About Chromebooks.  About Chromebooks.  So, yeah, Kevin's a better, because the complaint, almost all of the reviews I read were not  about the hardware.  They were about basically Chrome OS and often about Android on Chrome OS.  That's well, which is I've complained about too.  Yeah.  And you can't blame them.  Pixel Slate and Pixel Slate Keyboard Review, Portability and Productivity at a Premium  Price, Kevin Toffle writing in AboutChromebooks.com.  He says, the Pixel Slate is a peak expression of the Chrome OS tablet, a powerful thin tablet  for portability and content consumption in a relaxed environment, but all of the productivity  of a full desktop Chromebook with a detachable keyboard.  He said, there's a price to pay for premium design and performance.  Yeah, literally.  The model I recommend, it looks like, that Kevin got is the i5 configuration, which has  8 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of eMMC storage.  That is probably the sweet spot.  You can get an i7, you can spend more money, but I'm not sure that's really worth it.  And I wouldn't go too much lighter than that.  Those are pretty low-powered processors.  This i5 is a Y-series processor, so even it isn't super fast.  I do love the screen resolution, 3000 by 2000.  It's UHD615 graphics from Intel, shared memory.  He says, you don't sacrifice on performance, which I would say makes sense.  He compares it in performance to a Pixelbook and to a Chromebook Spin, and the Spin is the  winner in every case, almost every case, but it is significantly faster than last year's  Pixelbook.  So as Pixelbook users, Jeff, you and I, we might be interested just for the upgrade in  performance.  The only place, looks like the Pixel Slate was faster than the Chromebook Spin from Acer  was the BaseMark benchmark.  And everything else, Spinometer 1 and 2, JetStream and Octane, the Chromebook Spin was faster.  It's a premium price, but it's less expensive, I think, than the Slate for what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the price of the Chromebook, of the Acer?  Spin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's 700 or 800 bucks.  He has his review of the Spin as well, but the Spin isn't a tablet, it's a 2-in-1, you  know, it's one of those foldable things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a 2-in-1, I can't contribute with Chromebook stats, so I'll sing a song.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a nice voice.  Keep going.  Sing the eyes of Texas are upon you.  Now, I wonder, did Kevin say whether he prefers the Google keyboard or the Bridge keyboard?  Because the Bridge is 50 bucks cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did he order both?  I think he just ordered the Google keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd recognize.  He says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  So you can ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says that one annoyance, and I think Dieter Bohn said this as well on The Verge, of the  Google keyboard is it's kind of sloppy and floppy, and Dieter said unless you have a  really solid flat surface, it's going to give a little bit.  Kevin says carrying the Slate with the keyboard cover, which is a folio style, it goes over  front and the back, has a little movement as well.  Some keyboard wobble when you type, but also movement as you carry it.  It's a minor annoyance at best to me, writes Kevin, but others may really dislike it.  If you don't like it, the Bridge...  Yeah, he doesn't have it, but the Bridge is another option.  I really like the circular keys, and I do like the fact that it's backlit.  That's something that Apple's keyboard folio is not, and I find that a big annoyance for  the iPad, I'm sorry, the iPad Pros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm forgetting now, I get so confused, the other differences between the Google keyboard  and the Bridge keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if the Google, the Bridge keyboard has a fingerprint reader, the Google keyboard  does, or maybe that's on the on-off switch, I'm sorry, I guess that's on the Slate itself.  Battery life is good, camera app is from Android.  No headphone, Jack.  And I know Dieter Bohne had problems with the Bluetooth dropping out on his Slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it has a Pixel C, Jack.  Yeah, both Kevin and...  I mean, not a C, I mean a USB-C. I finally bought, arrived today, a USB headset.  Oh good, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  USB-C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it good? Which one did you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google ships one with its Pixel 3 that's pretty good, actually.  I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they just shipped a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, you get headphones with a Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very nice one.  But those don't fit in my ears, this fits in my ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Google's USB-C to a headphone adapter dongle works on an iPad Pro as well,  which is good news.  I guess there is a standard now for that.  They do not include, oh they do, I'm sorry, with the Slate they include the adapter as  well so you could use regular headphones.  He seems like he liked it.  He says, as much as I liked it in my first week, it's not a device for everyone.  Not everyone needs a Chrome OS tablet when a two or one might be better suited.  You should ask yourself these two questions, Jeff, to decide if the Pixel Slate is for you.  Oh, that's another article.  I fall, okay, now I have to go to that article.  He doesn't say what the questions are.  Here are the two questions.  True tablet or two and one Chromebook?  Okay.  Do you really want a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think I want a Chromebook, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the Spin might be a better choice then.  The reason I haven't bought one yet, I really like my Pixelbook and I don't find a need to upgrade.  And then how much performance do you need?  And that's because performance, at least on this, comes at a pretty steep price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have big Chromebook news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten and I did this before the show.  So finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, Skype works with video calls in the Chrome browser.  Oh.  So we tested that, Karsten and I did before the show, not in the Android Skype app, because we know it does not work well.  No, in browser Skype.  But the in browser Skype on the Chromebook, finally, all it did was calls before, now it does video calls.  And it works.  And Karsten said it works.  And the fact that he liked the camera on the camera on my Chromebook made me look better than this camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh, exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so he was he was ready to just make that the device for the show.  But I said, no, let's play safe. I don't want to get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we'll get more with Kevin next week.  Or you could listen to the IOT podcast from this week.  Right, Stacey, he spent some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do not talk about Chromebooks on the podcast.  We talked before we did the show.  How dare you, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Kevin will be filling in for Stacey next week.  So, or no.  And I will now likely be on.  So, oh, God.  So he was going to fill in for Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now he'll just be on as an extra guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All three of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was filling in for Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not going to be here next week.  I'm going to be in Manhattan watching a play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be in Paris, but I'm not flying well, just for a day and a half.  But I'll probably be able to do the show for at least a while that night.  So come in here, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So there you go.  There's I I really don't.  Yeah, I should order it to review it.  I think we I think Jason Howell is going to do that.  So we'll get a chance to play with it a little bit.  I just don't feel like I need to replace my Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, same here.  I wouldn't I wouldn't mind a new Pixelbook.  They could sucker me in to buy a new Pixelbook just because it has more performance and memory or whatever.  Again, I would kill for LTE in it.  And I'm surprised they didn't put LTE in the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, boy, that's a that's a missing piece.  I guess you don't have fine.  Well, I guess their feeling is you could just hotspot from your phone.  Why wouldn't you just do that?  Why don't they have like an instant tether feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that Apple? That might be Apple.  They do. They have a tether, but it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's do a little change log.  Change log. What do you say, kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google change log.  He was right on that button, man.  Did not waste a millisecond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the big story is it isn't Project Fi anymore.  It's Google Fi.  And actually, even bigger story, you can now use it on many Android phones and even your iPhone.  Heresy.  Heresy. Heresy.  It does take some extra configuration to use on your iPhone.  And there are some features missing in particular.  Voicemail. You won't get the visual voicemail.  You'll still get a text with the text of the voicemail.  But if you want to listen to the voicemail, you actually have to call the voicemail number.  Big deal on an iPhone.  And you have to go in there and mess with it a bit.  My messages will work over Wi-Fi, but to get it to work for SMS over Fi, you'll need to change some settings.  All of that is pretty straightforward.  But you get many of the benefits of Google Fi, which both Jeff and I use and love.  It's $20 a month for voice and text.  Unlimited voice and text in the U.S.  International travelers will pay a little more for the voice calls, but not much.  And the text continues to be unlimited for the 20-buck base price.  And then data is 10 bucks a gigabyte, up to 6 gigabytes.  And then free after that until you get to 15 gigabytes.  And then you have a choice of either being throttled or paying 10 bucks a gigabyte for the next.  Oh, you do have a choice then?  Yeah, you can after 15.  I read this, but I'd forgotten about it.  Paul Therotte tried it when he was in Europe.  He said, yeah, let's, you know, they actually notify you.  They say, hey, you're coming up on 15 gigs.  Would you like to be throttled?  He said, let it throttle.  And he said it was fine.  Or would you like to pay and have full speed at the same price, 10 bucks a gigabyte for subsequent gigabytes?  So that's very fair, if you ask me.  It works internationally in 100-some countries, almost 200 countries.  That's nice, too, because if you travel a lot, you don't have to do anything.  Your phone just continues to work.  Data continues to work.  And you pay the same price, except for, as I said, long distance calls from Europe.  The PHY app, there will be a PHY app for iOS, which will help you a little bit configuring Google PHY to work with iOS.  It's actually quite a nice looking app.  The other thing that Paul Therotte said, and I hadn't seen this, is that it won't do that special thing Google PHY does on Pixel phones, which is hunt for the best network.  The way PHY works on a Pixel, for instance, is it will use T-Mobile, Sprint or US Cellular, or Wi-Fi, whichever of the four is the strongest.  And it hands off seamlessly.  So I'll be at home on Wi-Fi, drive out my door, drive up the driveway.  It'll switch over to T-Mobile.  And the call will continue as if nothing had happened, which is pretty cool.  Apparently, the ability to detect or to operate on other networks is not on other phones, not on all phones.  I think those phones will show up as T-Mobile or always use T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one odd thing about my PHY phone, and again, I use it mainly internationally.  So I use my older Pixel, my original Pixel.  It can take sometimes a half a day to get configured to the network.  Really? I've not experienced that.  I don't know what it is or why it is. It's very weird.  If anybody from Google is hearing and knows what the problem might be, I don't know.  But it just won't hook in.  And finally it does.  I've never had a not do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So a lot of phones, Samsung phones, Moto phones, LG phones, OnePlus phones will work now with Google PHY as well as iOS phones.  So you really, it's basically now they are a real service, not just a project PHY.  They are Google PHY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, what happens when it doesn't connect?  So what are you using? Are you roaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have to use my other, I use my US phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have never experienced that ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. So now you can get up to 900.  If you go to the Google page, which I had to go to incognito because it kept on taking me in my own account.  Right. You go to the PHY page, you shop for phones.  It says that if you order a Pixel 3, you get up to $999 in travel gift cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still not ordering a Pixel 3.  That would pay me free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you been seeing the Pixel?  I can't believe the amount of money Google's spending on NFL games for the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not a real man, so I don't watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you were a man, you'd know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, that's okay. I'm not a real man either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, I'm the only real man around here.  On Monday Night Football, they're doing a great job because first they show the best shot thing.  They show that great video with people, their face all squenched up.  They show that and then they do a great night site demo.  They do a wide angle selfie demo.  They must be spending millions on marketing this phone.  I'll tell you, if it sounds like they think that the number one feature people are looking for in a smartphone is a camera,  because that's what they're pushing, and I have to say they have the best camera on the market.  That's what you wanted.  By the way, speaking of how much they spent, not only did they buy the NFL Monday Night Football,  which I have to think is expensive, they had Queen and ACDC as the real music from the real artists as their background music.  That's got to cost a pretty penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Wait, Queen, Freddie Mercury, he's dead.  But they still have to pay for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Death does not let you off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're saying they were singing live in the background or they just were...  No, no, no. They weren't live.  I was very confused, Leo. I'm like, can they get his hologram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, yeah, Freddie Mercury was in. Here is the Pixel ad.  Let me play it for you for a night site. This is the one you'd see.  And they're using the Queen song for Flash Gordon to show how bad Flash photography looks.  Everybody's blinded. They take pictures of food. It looks horrible.  Everybody's annoyed in the restaurant. You're at a concert trying to take pictures.  All you get is your girlfriend. Lose the Flash, not the moment.  And then they show night sighting. It looks so good.  And a brilliant, by the way, use of Queen.  Flash, ha ha. You want to see the selfie, Cam Ag?  I don't know who this ad is. Who this song is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Aerosmith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it? Of course it is. Steve Perry. Yeah.  Living on the edge. That's perfect.  That's perfect. Let's see what is the other one.  It's actually... These are really good ads. Let's see.  So Google's got... I don't know what their marketing budget is, but holy cow.  Oh, Pixel Slate has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission.  This device is not and may not be offered for sale or lease or sold or leased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One, two, three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's another one. Is there all the new things from Google?  It's funny because you don't think of Google as a hardware company trying to make money on hardware.  One up, one up, and bring it down and we're going to switch.  That's why I have a Google Home Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm just looking at this. So you really do.  So you get travel certificates, gift cards. What kind of travel?  Like Delta Airlines, Airbnb, Hotels.com, Southwest Airlines.  Today only? Equaling the amount of the purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It ends tonight at midnight Pacific. So it's a free phone.  A free phone if you're going to use those services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, as much as I travel, yeah. Go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go, Jeff, go.  Jeff Man. Jeff Jarvis.  I'm so sorry, Jeff. You're in a good mood, Stacey. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's happy about ARM servers. I am so ecstatic.  All you need to do to make Stacey happy is ARM servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exciting chip news does the trick.  So although here's my question, you guys.  I have big fears because all of the major hardware companies like Apple, Google,  Amazon, Microsoft, they're developing their own chips for various different TPUs or the Bionic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple's going to replace all the Intel chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does that mean as you shrink the huge buyers of these chips?  What does that mean for everyone else who is dependent on them?  So I think it's a fundamental restructuring of like the chip industry, which is already consolidating.  But I sit there and I think about that a lot because, you know, a lot of innovation comes from startups.  But historically, a lot of innovation, especially in actual manufacturing, has come from the bigger companies.  And I know TSMC does a lot there, too.  But it's the it's the designs from like the big companies that force them to do that.  Anyway, this is this is something I'm thinking a lot about.  So if anyone wants to talk about this, you just give me a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tyler, not Steve Perry. Steve Perry is the lead singer of Jane's Addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jane's Addiction, which they played at AWS.  They played Ben Kotsteen. It's all tied together with armed servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you moaning about? It's Perry Farrell. Perry Farrell.  Steven Perry, isn't he the guy who's the night's journey in the city and the sun shines on.  And then there's Joe Perry, who's the guitarist for Smith.  So it all got muddled. Of course, I meant Steven Tyler, the guy with the lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, Carson, you sounded almost insulted. So I feel bad now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were like, oh, he was really upset.  Apparently, Jane's addiction fan. I'm a Jane's Addiction fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just bad at names. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you know that Google's chief business officers named Phil Schindler?  That's confusing. Yeah, I know.  Philip Schindler, not Phil Schiller, wrote about Disney and Google expanding their strategic relationship.  As we continue with the changelog, Disney and Google share a passion.  Oh my God, we're still in the changelog. That's what I was just like.  That's why I said that a little parenthetically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are in the magic wonderland. We're never going to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's going to power advertising for Disney's brands, Disney, ABC, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars.  This is funny because, of course, the relationship between Disney, Pixar and Apple is pretty tight.  But I guess Apple doesn't have an ad platform. So there, Google is acquiring a one billion dollar Mountain View office park.  It's 2018's largest Bay Area real estate deal. Congratulations.  Just before Thanksgiving, they bought Britannia Shoreline, 51 acres across from and larger than the Googleplex.  There are 12 structures there, but they're going to tear those down, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't they do the largest real estate deal in New York when they did the Chelsea, when they bought that office block?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have to tell you, Kevin has sent me a correction saying that the FCC approved the whatever it was that you said was an office block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know they did. But for some reason on the YouTube ad, yeah, because he's got one.  So obviously it's approved now. But for some reason on that YouTube ad.  He also says that he's worked in the browser for months. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want you to know this because he sends them to me and I'm like, oh, do I convey this? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If Skype has worked as phone calls, but I was not getting the video opportunity, now I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know what Kevin has to say about that.  Kevin, I'm sure knew what to do and I was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google bought Chelsea Market for 2.4 billion. So that was a little more expensive.  But that's Manhattan, New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh God, to go down on the first floor there, it's worse than going through Times Square. Tourists, tourists, tourists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And do they have Desnudas or Tacomi Elmo walking around too?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No Elmo's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just tourists.  I've had to go to meetings in that building and it's just torture to get through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they touristing about? What's down there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first floor of Chelsea Market is hip shops and restaurants and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no wonder I don't know about it. It's hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is updating its fast pairing feature on Android and Chromebooks.  So you can simultaneously pair compatible Bluetooth devices with phones, tablets and laptops that share the same Google account.  This is kind of like what Apple does with AirPods.  When you link the headphones to one product, all the devices connected to the account will automatically pair.  That's very convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to guess it won't work with my account.  Just going to guess.  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you know what? They should just send you like a special, Jeff, not for you.  Not for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No convenience for you.  No convenience for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're on the need not to use list, Jeff.  And that is our Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say it's almost enough to get me to like find an alternative to G suites just so I can avoid the G Suite penalty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are going off of it, but I don't know how to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have we use G suites at work.  So I have Leo at Twit TV, but I have my Google account reported Gmail.  What I use for all of those things is a consumer account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But I use my business calendar, for example, and when I travel, if I make things in my business business email, then they don't flow over into places.  I need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I use calendar sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have calendar sharing, but I can't, you know, share my calendar on my Google stuff.  No, it's it's a little easier if you log into your phone under your personal account.  But then what happens is you end up doing more things like I'll send invites out from my personal thing when I mean to do it from my.  And we saw how that cost Hillary Clinton the presidency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I would want you.  Yes.  Don't pull an Ivanka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of Ivanka, she and cook visited a school.  I put the link of the links up on the.  Yeah, there's a controversy here.  So Ivanka and Apple were buddying up in Idaho.  Download under other.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple's donated iPads to students and Max to teachers in schools in this district.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was the students protested because they don't like the iPads.  Yeah.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did.  Okay, well, you know, people are upset about this because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve Cook and Ivanka Trump were buddying up to each other.  Cook and Ivanka liked each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shame.  We should make them walk naked through the town square ringing a bell.  Shame.  MIT.  This is actually the big story of the of the maybe the week, the year, the decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crisp.  Baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chinese scientists, according to a story in the MIT technology review, have used CRISPR  to gene edit embryos to actually eliminate.  They're they they eliminate gene called CCR five, which would render these children resistant  to HIV, smallpox and cholera.  Now, what's not clear, we know they're doing this according to Chinese medical documents  posted online.  What's not clear is if those embryos have been gestated to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Birth twin girls were born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, then we know they have live.  So they have made.  Oh, OK.  So the Associator Press then updated the story from the technology review to say one couple  gave birth to twin girls this month.  A peak was not able to confirm this independently.  He released a promotional video.  So so there you go.  This is both shocking and amazing.  CRISPR is a gene editing technique that's somewhat like cut and paste and and and illegal  or well, illegal in the US, illegal in Europe and the US, but not in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shame.  No, China says shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's actually unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an app.  I need the shame app.  The Bell of Shame app, the team at the Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  China, has been recruiting couples in an effort to create the first gene edited babies.  I don't think it's illegal in China, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's illegal in China.  I don't think it's illegal in China.  Maybe not appropriately.  Of course, the real concern is, I mean, I don't think anybody would complain about the  elimination of the CCR5 gene, but that's just I mean, that's just one of the many things.  One of the wonderful things you can make children that glow in the dark if you wish.  They're one of the many things you can do with the CRISPR technology.  There's also the issue.  I have seen reports that sometimes CRISPR can be used to make children.  There's also the issue.  You won't lose them.  I have seen reports that sometimes CRISPR causes errors elsewhere in the gene.  So there may be some side effects.  I don't know.  I'm not an expert on CRISPR.  But this is, you know, there's the risk of introducing unwanted mutations or, according  to the technology review, yielding a baby whose body is composed of some edited and  some unedited cells.  I don't know if that's bad or good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think?  It certainly changes things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think honestly, that's what I meant when I said this could be the story of the  year, really.  Yeah.  We've known that this was coming at some point.  That somebody rogue or otherwise was going to do this.  Apparently it has been done now in China.  So in China, the MIT technology story says currently using a genetically engineered embryo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to establish a pregnancy would be illegal in much of Europe, prohibited in the US, and  it's also prohibited in China under a 2003 ministerial guidance to IVF clinics.  But that's the problem.  It's a guidance, not a law.  It is not clear if Hay got special permission or disregarded the guidance.  Which may not have the force of law.  Yeah.  I got to think though in China, you don't do anything like this without government.  Yeah.  And you don't announce it if you don't feel pretty secure in the fact that you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to jail tomorrow.  But I would say that's moral panic, Jeff.  Yes.  Cue Jeff.  Cue panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably prudent to pass those laws until you can be sure that this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  could be done safely.  I think it is.  Yeah.  But honestly, think of all the laws that are in place.  Yeah.  But honestly, think of all the benefit.  This is going to, I mean, talk about Pandora's box.  This is going to, this is now because there's all sorts of beneficial things you can think  of, but there's huge consequences in the case of haves and have nots where people can choose  to have smarter, more athletic, more attractive babies because they can afford to have the  editing or perhaps, you know, I mean, there's always been genetic editing in a very primitive  way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hold on because CRISPR can be, and they're not researching it, but there is the theory,  and I think they've done it in animals, that actually you can change genes in people who  are living.  After the fact, yeah.  After the fact.  I don't know how to express that.  After the birth.  Postnatal.  Thank you.  Postnatal.  P.N.  That's kind of me.  I'm just postnatal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all postnatal now.  We're all postnatal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, depending on, I mean, there's going to be limits possibly.  I mean, who knows?  But it's possible we could get similar updates or more importantly, our kids, like I had  someone with a 12 year old, I'm like, oh my gosh, is my child now obsolete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is a, I just think this is huge.  We knew it was coming.  It was inevitable.  CRISPR has made some real progress.  I don't know what to say except that you, this is, this could be a watershed moment  in humanity where we're actually able to edit genes and reprogram the blueprints of life  itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  What would you do if you, I mean, like, I've been thinking about this.  I'm like, what kind of things, I mean, first you have to decide if it's something that  is expressed easily in a gene and is not, you know, part of like multiple genes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, look, we know already that people have used more brutal methods to get rid of  girls and keep boys.  That's clearly, that kind of genetic editing would be clearly immoral and wrong and it  would be easy to pass a law against that, harder to enforce.  But, and I don't think CRISPR actually can do something that dramatic.  I think it's much more you can snip out or replace, you know, little portions of the  gene.  You're not going to take a whole Y chromosome out or something.  But,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, you just abort that girl baby.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you're not going to edit.  That's what I'm saying.  It's been done, it's been done for years in more primitive fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are like traits like intelligence.  Those actually, we don't know where those are.  So we can't, some of this stuff we can't do.  Now you could actually, you're a glow in the dark baby, bioluminescent babies.  We've actually, we understand that gene.  Yeah, CRISPR has been used to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so.  Actually, actually, that's why I turn pink on the show all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about though, I mean, mostly you could see this in genetics for, you could take out  the BRCA gene variant, for instance, that often is connected to breast cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's other, one gene can have multiple effects is the issue.  Right.  Well, that's right.  And it's future generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't really understand this very well.  Or sickle cell anemia could be eliminated in certain populations.  But yeah, and we don't, you're right.  Intelligence is a much more difficult issue or athleticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it true that if you change a gene in me and then I father a child.  It's not guaranteed.  The genes are changed in the next generations.  So you're having an impact past the one person.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, it's like climate change only it's on our species.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's I'm telling you that you're going to look back and say, well, that was that everything  changed suddenly or maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe this is maybe a the guy could be lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't walk it back.  You got it.  You just got to be.  It's a big.  I agree with you, man.  It's a big moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  Logitech is not blind plantronics after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't think they were, but that's like, you know, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rumor there were it was going to be a big purchase.  They were in talks.  Ohio is the first state to be to accept Bitcoin for tax payments.  Too bad Bitcoin just lost 40 percent of its value in the last two weeks.  Redeem that quickly.  Corel is buying Parallels, which is a virtualization.  Sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I like Parallels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good.  It's a way to run Windows and a Mac or that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be SW soft or was it?  I don't know.  Anyway, yeah.  OK.  Australia.  I didn't know Corel was still around.  Corel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they used to be word perfect, but then they really branched out.  And I think we're talking about this on Windows Weekly.  They really are more a portfolio company than anything else these days.  Oh, look, this whole time, I didn't even know it.  I've had a Facebook portal looking at my crotch.  I don't know what you're doing down there, little portal.  You thought I might want to use that on the show today?  I just noticed it.  Australia to build a pirate proof fence.  This is a little scary from the register today.  Australia is certain to have a new site blocking regime imposed by the government  with the Senate committee deciding to waive the legislation through.  The draft law has passed the Senate today.  It will go to the House of Representatives.  The Copyright Amendment Online Infringement Bill 2018.  If it does pass and the register thinks it seems likely to pass,  it would give rights holders greatly expanded powers to force take downs of infringing content.  Is this kind of like Article 13 in the EU copyright bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, Article 13 has preemptive requirements of the platforms.  This is postnatal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so it's post facto.  Rights holders postnatal will be able to seek injunctions against search engines  requesting blocks on file sharing sites and block what the legislation calls  alternative pathways to pirated content.  The test for a site's illegality will be widened from sites whose primary purpose is infringement,  kind of like a BitTorrent linking site, to cover sites whose primary effect is infringement.  All right, so the committee recommends Bill's operation be reviewed two years after it kicks into action.  The only party dissenting, the Green Party.  Senator Janet Wright opposed site blocking saying copyright is better addressed by making the content available  conveniently, affordably, in a timely way.  What a revolutionary idea.  You got a piracy problem?  Make it easier to buy.  What a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Copyright is a Gutenberg-era notion.  IP is a Gutenberg-era notion, right?  Yes, this whole notion of property.  Intellectual.  Clawless property, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are those working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, except are they fully waterproof?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're either IP65 or IP64 rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I've been having some shorting problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh oh, hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody told me that even though they're called outdoor, they actually aren't waterproof.  So I just move them in under the under the under the roof.  It says perfect for any outdoor environment, rugged, rain-tight design.  Yeah, let me look at their IP rating.  I don't see an IP rating. That's that's IP rating.  That's what kind of concerned me a little bit.  Anyway, they are controlling my holiday, my Christmas lights.  And except for that minor thing where they set off the GFI circuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sometimes that well, sometimes that happens with normal Christmas lights.  Oh, could be.  So that is a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I was surprised.  Actually, the nice thing about the iDevices, besides the fact that I can turn these on from here, if it gets to be a gloomy day, is it tells you power consumption.  Oh, yeah.  Which is fascinating because I had no idea our Christmas lights are costing us six dollars a night.  Do you not have LEDs?  Yeah, they're LEDs.  There's just a lot of them.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we have a picture of the display?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think on my blog.  Let me just see, because I think this is so cool.  Seven hours.  Oh, no, it's gone down.  OK, this was when we were installing it.  Seven hours daily use 16 cents.  That's not too bad.  That's for set one.  Here's set two.  Oh, no, these are the expensive ones.  Seven hours daily use six dollars and seventy six cents.  So this is this.  This is which ones are these?  These are.  Yeah, this is the front yard.  I think they're all LEDs, but there's some there's some blinking ones and there's some ice crystals.  They're they're a little bit more expensive.  See, I just turn them on.  I hear like that.  Boom.  My Christmas lights are on.  Turn them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very tasteful, Leo.  I was expecting garish.  Oh, you're looking at the blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  I thought you were expecting garish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I thought you'd go for a hoot and overdo it and have dancing Santas and things.  No, no, it's pretty.  I think I like the netlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These balls up in the portico.  You don't see what you don't see is the blinking icicles in the stars.  Those are behind there.  These balls keep falling down, though.  I got dropped.  My balls drop and it's terrible.  It's terrible.  You didn't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Punch Leo, punch Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but it is pretty and it's festive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yeah, I think I like it.  I like it.  I'm still not finding there.  I'd be ready.  Yeah, I don't think they have one.  But anyway, they're they're now under the eave.  I should I think that's a better place for them.  And they haven't they haven't popped the circuit in a while.  But I've got to ask a completely off question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now that I'm in your blog, you have that lovely picture of you  basically getting married.  Yes.  There's a picture of you.  Here's the picture of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the front page rotates.  There's a picture of you, me and Gina at Google I.O.  So the front page is different images all the time.  So the wedding picture you have next to no hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that because of New Year's Eve?  Yep.  Oh, wow.  Lisa will never.  Yes.  She was upset.  We got married a month later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hadn't put two and two together there.  That's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I shaved my head for UNICEF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We raised eighty thousand dollars, something like that.  I also got a little tiny tattoo on my butt.  The hair is grown back.  But every time Lisa sees my butt, she says nice tattoo.  And I go, oh, crap.  I've forgotten.  But I think of the thanks I just I just you shaved to Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We shaved you for the.  Well, about only this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think you got married.  Yeah.  And it was fun.  We raised a lot of money.  I wish those New Year's Eve things.  But I do too.  Yeah, they were a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, I found an answer for you on your it is not IP.  It's rated ring tight by U.L. according to I.Devices.  What's that mean?  So it I guess it means it's rain tight.  So rain tight is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't want to submerge it in water.  Right.  OK.  We're getting some pretty severe storms out here.  Thank goodness.  Now, after the fires, we're more than welcome.  But it did short.  They're on a GFI circuit.  So I waited till things dried out, pushed the reset and it's working fine.  Stacey, I didn't mean interrupt.  That was your pick from some time ago.  What's what do you have this week?  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this week I'm trying out a new device.  I'll tell you about that next week once I know how well it works or doesn't work.  But I went out because Starbucks has a brand new coffee.  I've been tweeting about this because I've been so infatuated with it.  What's the star introduced the juniper latte?  And as a gin lover and a coffee lover, I was like, can I bring my two loves together?  The answer is I cannot.  So Juniper is the is the holly berry that gives that unique flavor to many gins,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which is one traditional gin.  And it does.  Like it tastes Christmasy.  It tastes like for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It tastes Christmasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It tastes like forests and a like fine flavor with delightful citrus and hangovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like hangovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's so they also put pine citrus sugar on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do.  So my challenge when I got one this afternoon, because I asked people for their takes  and most people had negative takes.  One person said it was fruity and kind of had a floral undertone.  He liked it, but nobody else has.  So I tried it.  I did not like it.  I think if I were going to try it again, I would probably try it with the blonde or the blonde roast  because the bitterness of the coffee really fought with the kind of florally flavor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or just get yourself some goddamn gin and drink it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's your other option.  So I just want to let everybody know since this was this has been my Twitter quest for the last two days,  I thought I'm going to talk about it.  The tuna for latte.  Yeah, because it's their new holiday drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It tastes like, according to Fox News, it tastes like grass and dirt.  I didn't get dirt.  Yeah.  But I'll give it grass.  Fox would probably like it better if it said Merry Christmas on the cup.  I did not get a red cup.  I got a green cup.  I guess they have different holiday cups.  How about this, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about coffee gin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gin Plut coffee gin.  Those crazy Germans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your favorite gin?  I have four.  Okay, out with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Super junipery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you feel like forest.  It is St. George terroir.  It's made in California.  If you want a smooth drinking gin with a hint of cardamom, 209.  If you are in the middle of Spain and it's hot and you want the kind of original gin,  get a gin mare and have it with rosemary.  It's delicious.  And what's my other?  Oh, it's made in Utah.  It's called Jackrabbit gin.  It's from a small distillery called Beehive.  And it is excellent in cocktails and in martinis.  It's a little sweeter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I love my gin.  Which 209 do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a number of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the normal 209, although they have a kosher 209.  I see that.  Kosher for Passover gin and vodka.  I believe it is the only kosher gin out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they have Chardonnay barrel, Sauvignon Blanc barrel, or Cabernet Sauvignon barrel gin as well.  I'm going to try this.  I am a G&T drinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So 209 makes a really good gin and tonic.  I would recommend using Q Tonic or the Fever Tree lighter tonic.  I usually do Fever Tree.  Q is a little better for that because it's less sweet and it will let the flavor shine through, I think.  But that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just go for the G.  Just straight G.  Just straight G.  No vermouth, no nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I can get you guys to come out for Twit on Sunday the 23rd, we have to bribe people because it's two days before Christmas.  We're going to open a bottle of $5,000 cognac.

Transcript:  $20 gin you might have us.  Yeah.

Transcript:  In that beautiful crystal bottle.  Why are you doing this?  It's just a bribe to get people to come to the...  Because it's the day before Christmas Eve.  And because it's more fun to do those holiday Twits a little warmed up.  Oh.  I have yet to find a bottle of it.  I've got to... I promised Alex Lindsay.  No, I will.  And it may not be $5,000.  It may be less than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if it's more?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody... I don't know.  It depends how much you get.  I'm not going to get a Jeroboam of it.  That would be crazy talk.  They do make a Jeroboam.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know nothing about cognac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how would you like to learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I should learn on a $5,000 bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll never enjoy it again by anybody else.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you're number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At my hotel in Stockholm, they gave us little tiny airline bottles of brandy every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  In the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of nice.  It's actually... You don't really sleep better.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't have them.  But I thought I'm not going to throw this out.  So I put them in my... With my soap and deodorant.  So I have them.  I'll put them in the liquor cabinet.  But anyway.

Transcript:  Oh, there's a gin advent calendar?  Which is a different gin every night.

Transcript:  Yeah, here.  Instead of my... Since we've gone off the rails.  Oh, my God.  Next week, I do have a connected device for you.  So it's not totally crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to match that.  Hold on one second.  I'm going to find this.  Give me a second.  Give me a second here.  BAMP.  Talk for a second.  I'm going to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Jim.  So we need a friend.  You what you need is someone in the UK to buy it.  And then to send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ideally, each tram you uncover from behind the 24 windows would be a total surprise.  That is a Scotch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is Scotch.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No wonder I was talking like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The master of malt calendar.  But there is gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is gin.  Wait.  Amazon had it.  Here's a whole.  Here's a whole page of advent calendars with booze.  Yeah, but gin is the only fun one.  The boutique gin company.  How about this?  Would you like that?  I can get you that.  Oh, you can actually ship to you in the US.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, but they have 209 in their gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, wait a minute.  You can buy it at the whiskey exchange shop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're moving into like an Irish accent.  That's normal.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since Jeff, did you have a number as well or do you want to make the beef that could  be yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me one.  Give me one.  Oh, let's see what I have to quickly.  How big?  Well, speaking of beef.  Yes.  The question that's been roiling the Internet today is how big is the big cow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How big is it?  Is it real?  Is it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the big cow?  So the big cow has been on Twitter of this gigantic cow.  Now the Washington Post is a killjoy and says that it's neither a cow nor a giant because  it's not a cow.  It's a steer.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a six foot four inch steer and it's real.  Here's the New York Times has a video.  It went unsold at an auction because potential buyers said it wouldn't fit in their quote  farm equipment.  That's an interesting euphemism.  It's farm equipment.  So he's a steer.  He's real, not a cow.  Well, yes, but it's a cow-ish thing.  It's a male cow, which would be a steer.  It's a cousin of it.  Yes.  Well, it's not a cousin.  It's just a male.  It's a boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of acting like a great day and then it's scared of little cows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually not the world's largest steer.  It's three inches short of the Guinness World Record for tallest living steer, but no one  bought it because you couldn't fit it in the equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very clever of you, steer.  Yes.  Way to stay alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what his name is?  Some pig.  Nickers.  So did you say some pig?  Yes.  Because they didn't process Wilbur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll do.  No, that's babe.  Oh, that's babe.  This is to avoid getting killed.  Wilbur had Charlotte spin the web of some pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, anyway.  One of these two inches taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger and weighs 2,800 pounds.  So this is what I'm missing by not being on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  See, you could have seen the story of the big cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's finally happened that I feel left out of the conversation because I'm not a Twitter  user.  Yeah, the big cow was everywhere.  Everywhere on Twitter.  Oh, maybe Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Brandwatch named Taylor Swift the most influential person on Twitter.  She tweeted only 13 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  But that one tweet where she said everybody should register and vote, that had a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  influence.  Donald Trump is not the most influential man on Twitter, says this ridiculous survey.  I think that's not true.  Who is the most influential person?  Liam Payne.  Liam Payne.  Oh, the singer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Pop stars.  The president is easily the most influential person on Twitter.  Yes, this is BS, these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But fine.  Besides the president.  Besides the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So since we're doing advent calendars, I will show you mine.  I do this every year.  The advent of code calendar.  Oh, we.  I'll take gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  So each day it's going to launch in 24 hours each or no longer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Saturday, 40, 52 hours at midnight Eastern time on December 1st.  The first puzzle will unlock.  They are coding puzzles.  So you know, you can go back in time.  previous years and see, but they're fun.  They're fun.  They're good.  And it's a lot of fun and it forces you to do a new solve a new problem every day.  It's advent of code.com.  Small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.  And they've been doing this for a long time, which is really cool.  And a lot of people participate.  So you can see other people's answers and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really sad about this gin thing.  I think it's just because our whiskey shipping laws are so difficult.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are basically blue laws.  We need a case.  So calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, just cheese.  I don't want new cheese every day.  I think gin isn't bad.  Gin's a good start.  Chocolate's pretty good.  It has to be good chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can't be like Hershey's chocolate.  Well, I mean, I'd still eat Hershey's chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a Godiva advent calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Godiva's just not my thing.  It's not my jam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not my jam.  What's your favorite chocolate?  Here's the cheese on that calendar.  Or cheese on a target.  Oh, just a little bit of cheese.  Don't let the mice find it.  What's your chocolate?  What's your chocolate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really have a like I don't have a favorite chocolate.  I like the Franz and Seattle.  They have the Franz Carmel's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are why she's moving to Seattle.  Boys and girls.  Zephyr got the right answer.  Seize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't love Seize either.  I don't I don't love chocolate.  That's probably something else I should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a weird, strange thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not going to lie.
