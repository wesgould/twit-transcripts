All right, here's here's from  here's here's  Let me paste this in this is from the hill  Clinton did she tweet?  No, I think it was that because at the code conference here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? At this point  Miss Clinton is a private citizen. She's not she's not bound to do anything  Except perhaps not pose with a chopped off head of Donald Trump. But other than that I  Have not seen the picture, but I don't think I want to see the picture so  confivi

Transcript:  confif  Covive this is that this is the next gift versus Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so funny. It's no no. This is  In three weeks, we're gonna pull this out of the remembrance hat. Oh, remember be like, what was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although be so much between here and there you're absolutely right Stacey. Oh, I dread to think  What the next three weeks hold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was it? Betty Davis said you're in for a bumpy ride holds fasten your seat belts. We're in for a bumpy ride  I feel sad about this. I was you know, I'm leaving on vacation in a few days  This will be my last twig for a couple of weeks  And I'm getting ready as I often do this is gonna be a very, you know photo  It's gonna be a photo expedition for at least send me we're both bringing our fancy cameras and all that and I am  So I put the software on and I went to the Nick  Collection because I love the Nick plugins  For Lightroom and lo and behold on the site and actually I saw this and I didn't realize it was newsworthy  But somebody's picked it up a couple of days later the Nick collection  free and compatible with  Mac OS 10.7 through 10 10 Windows Vista 7 and 8 does work with Windows 10 and  Adobe Photoshop through CC 2015. We have no plans to update the collection  Or add new features over time. It's the death now. This is a company Google bought a few years ago  They bought them for snap seed which was the app which Google does keep up to date and offers on Android and iOS  It's an excellent photo editing app, but pros really liked in a collection Lisa uses  Their silver effects which and many pros use it as the best black and white  Photography filter, but they had a lot of other great treats. So it's a little sad  But the Nick collection it has been free  Since Google bought it they turned that it was 150 bucks and I bought it  Shortly before Google gave it a start giving it away. In fact, but it is free but it  Who knows how long it will continue to work? So that's kind of sad Lisa was complaining actually that silver effects was not working reliably

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm dying to know  Have you ordered an essential of course, well I put my name in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I I was on a little bit of a buying spree. Oh  Andy Rubin's essential which is of course Andy Rubin was at  Danger, right? He created this helped create the sidekick. He was an apple before that  Yep, went to danger with Bill Atkinson  Then went on to create on his own with you know, a company called Android which Google bought  Became the basis for the Android operating system worked there for a long time  Remember remember a couple of years ago  We talked about the fact that he was leaving the Android division  To do a moonshot with robots because he's with the guys really into robots his house his whole house is robotified  left Google to start this  This  Secret startup which now has kind of gone public  It's an Android phone called the essential and more than that. I'm Stacy. I'm actually very interested what you think of it a  home  Automation unit with an open source operating system not like coming another one of these  Pretty it's pretty it has a screen  it  it's  Apparently less dependent on the cloud whatever that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is not everything locally that it can and then there's some privacy functions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably a response to you know, people's concerns about Google Home and Amazon's echo  It's echo like although it also is for home automation, right?  Or what do you know about it because there's not a lot to say this is this is all we all we see

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I've seen I've looked at the website. I watched part of his code most of his code thing and then I got called away  I'm  Not super thrilled about this so this is gonna come out there's no pricing on the home thing yet  It's gonna come out in June into June. I believe is what they said. So we'll know more than I  Feel like the phone  The phone feels very fetishistic to me in a way that I don't care about because I'm actually not a gadget lover  Like so when he's talking about the titanium and the 360 coverage the only thing that I was excited about was like, oh stock Android  But this is this is just me. I know there's lots of people who looked at this and was like, whoa  So I'm really interested in how it's gonna interact with the home because what this says is  He feels like you have to have a phone to work with a home and they apparently need to work together. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wish that weren't true. I think he's not he's right  But and I tweeted a little bit about this  the focus on the gadgets  feels  Aging to me. It's an aging idea. I want to focus on construct  Sorry construct context  Hardware so much. Yeah, and and I feel like there's a chance that it may do this  But we just haven't seen enough in the context stuff is easy to say whoa  But it's really hard to deliver and he's got a plus on the openness. He's really hitting on openness which Kevin  I can't wait to hear your thoughts there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, the home is based on something called ambient OS which he says is gonna be completely open

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, and I signed up to get all the information and the SDK on that so we'll see but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a non trivial thing to do I mean he hasn't been working on this that long I don't I'm curious what he's I  Just I don't know  We don't you know, he hits. Yeah, I think he's hit the nail on the head when you said fetishistic. There is a certain  Fetishism having to do with these gadgets these phones  There are objects, you know, they're my precious  And I kind of agree with you and boy but at the same time, you know, I  Went kicking and screaming to cover these things  I didn't want to cover these things, but they have become the the computer that everybody uses more than anything else  So we kind of have to cover it. This is where yeah, I'm not saying it's not worth coverage. I just think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Want this to fade into the background? I feel like in 50 years  We're gonna look back at people clutching their phones and talking about them as like nuts, huh? That's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what well Mossberg said in his final column this week  He said this is the future of computing is disappear is that they will disappear  They will become part of the environment  Well, it's a smart dude, yeah  Well, it's actually it's pretty obvious. This is this is  Where we've been going for a long time and the computer is moving from this big centralized  object to decentralized and eventually in fabric every of our lives and machine learning will then as  As part of that as a thin layer of peanut butter on top of it  Be part of our lives and that's why voice interfaces and things like this  this home device  Are kind of I think going to be important because this is how we're gonna this is this will be the computer interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well and we'll interact with voice will interact with photos and images  Will interact with?  Other means I like that. You know what if what if the cloud were not called the cloud or were called peanut butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like that. It's everywhere. You can't get rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a Kevin do you think this is oh, sorry, please go ahead  I'm really curious on the the openness in obviously we don't know a lot yet, but thoughts there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what we knew he's he's demonstrated a belief in openness before he's done a good job with that with with Android  So he's got a track record to build on so I'm giving the benefit of down to it till we see the details. So  We do need you know Android has settled down as this as the the most successful OS we've had ever  And it has an open source base. So, you know more power to to rubin for starting that and continue it  I'm interested in the in the Internet of Things focus and and and  If he's if he's actually trying to bite off the can we write an OS for all of those?  Thing that that that is sort of hinted at here in this ambient OS stuff, but that's that's even there's even less, you know  Information about that now. So again very much wait and see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Maybe tied to the success of Android is also the in many ways the scariest least secure operating system  Ever I know many people who will  Secure ever well, no, you're right. There've been many many many more less insecure. However, given it is a reasonable sandboxing  yeah, but  Again, and again we hear about now. There's a you know, we talked about yesterday security now a fairly significant  flaw that allows remote root exploits of Android devices and in which Google doesn't plan to fix  And so this is more and more of a problem  And I know many people refuse to touch Android because they say it's just not secure  I mean they say I'm gonna use an iPhone instead. I don't know if that's really a good alternative, but but that's what the only alternative  yeah, what else you can you can use a  candy bar phone from Nokia, I guess  So I I think there's no other sweet split there's any more that's yeah  but that right because nobody's gonna bother to exploit that but I think that that's kind of an issue is  And I don't think openness solves this or contributes to it I want to be clear about that sometimes people say oh, yeah  That's because it's open. That's not the issue  But it is a problem and I you know  I don't while you could celebrate the success of Android  I think you you probably should also point to the fact that it's got some really intractable security problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that's I mean that's fair but  You know, it's  Yeah, we've seen a lot of a lot of security issues over the last since I was last on we've had we had the whole  And what it was called now but but the whole  Locked down the computers that was based on Windows SMB support that was left in there for several years  Yeah windows, too. Yeah  Yeah, and that was you know, there's this there's this and  There's a with me about some ways  It's very hard to completely secure something and the bigger the target the more time people spend on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. This is as big a target as you can get and the one of the stories this week Judy  New malware and Android may have infected 36  million Android phones  Partly because it's it's on 41 apps that were on the Google Play Store. They're now gone  It Google Play Store's screening is not very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's gotten a lot better. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there's some people might disagree with you for instance  Let me say what was the name of the malware we were talking about on security now yesterday  This is a terrible cautionary tale the the the bug was revealed to Google  Six months a year ago. They did nothing about in fact, they marked it won't fix  So the company that discovered the bug  Has publicized it  They even did a proof of concept where they made an app that took advantage of it  it's called the content jacking flaw they made an app that would take advantage of it and  Submitted it to the Android store was approved in half a day and it's still there and  the problem with this  Content jacking is it's it's a very it's a simple flaw  And I think the reason Google won't fix it is because it's used it takes advantage of accessibility features  There's two there's two permissions that it takes advantage of one is the ability to one application to draw over  another application and that allows a  malicious application to to present a different  look  Something like you're logging into your Google or whatever  Very difficult to mitigate this and Google doesn't apparently seem to want to fix it  This is and this is just the latest in a long line of these  And the Google and the Google screening process did not catch it  It's they say 60% of Android users almost a billion Android phones  Are affected by this and and Google just you know  So I just I you know, that's I only bring that up because I you know, I don't blame Andy Rubin for that  No  but  If you're gonna talk about the success of Android you have to mention this as well and  IOT as you know is a big issue security is a big issue  Yeah, well, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a different it is but there's  securing a connected IOT device is  Securing a connected IOT device is  Kind of a different kettle of fish and thinking about the operating system will solve some of the issues, but it's not going to solve  all of them, so I feel like  What we've done in smartphones isn't gonna work with IOT what we've done in smartphones hasn't worked entirely well with smartphones  But I think the stakes are a lot higher and the surface area is so much greater when we get to IOT  So it really matters and since everything historically has been so bad  We're gonna have a lot of problems until it gets better. I'm great  That's my optimistic thing someone in the chat room did point out from the verge the verge story where  Andy Rubin did say that  Ambient OS was gonna be open source and he apparently has some magic way of updating it more often  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even kind of contests that there are issues with  With Android and he kind of in his talk at code. He said well, you know people overstate the problem with Android  I'm not sure I agree with him on that. Well, he you know, he says he says nobody okay, Walt Mossberg  pointed out that Android  Is fragmented and splintered and and and people aren't getting the updates Rubin  Mossberg said the Google's OS is forked into wildly divergent versions around the world  But Rubin countered saying the variation was actually Android strength. Nobody gets a hundred percent upgrades  It's impossible Rubin said before suggesting that Apple's purported 80% upgrade rate was actually closer to  60 or 70 he did agree Android's upgrade rate was much lower. This is from the verge  That said that his new ventures ambient solution ambient OS had a solution for that which he didn't explain  Magic. Well, he said it's more of a managed service on the back end  You know, I mean part of the reason that it's so fragmented in Android is because you have so many  Manufacturers of phones many of whom sells such cheap Android phones that they don't you know  There's no aftermarket service and so they don't bother pushing out updates  If you if he makes the you know, the the essential home and you know, he could be could force updates  I mean, it's that's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple also controls its silicon which is inherently going to be more secure if you can control everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well and more to the point Apple has the carriers by the shorthairs and forces them to push the updates out  Which nobody Samsung even can get the carrier. I was doing my security update

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think last week and my phone went into the the boot loop cycle and now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know who gave you that new phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google did because it was still under warranty. I'm six months into you know, six months post pixel  so I didn't want to buy a new phone, so I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a their lawsuit was settled. I guess tell you what when I'm through with the essential phone. I'll send

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'll be bored with it within months

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't say all you do is you sign up for it. They'll tell you what's Chrome OS is update rate. Oh  Chrome OS I'm sure is almost 100% because that's right. They force it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an interesting counter example of an OS that does manage to update itself all the time  But that's because it's a browser based OS. So it it only works if you have a connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's forcing the issue in that way, right and there's no way to turn off updates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just happened you can run it without a web connection if you could you could yes, and you'd be safe you'd also be safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS is just like Chrome it gets automatic updates and and and on and it just itself. Yeah, and I should say

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to I think it was the Wired article that talked about this with the essential  One of the things they're talking about with the essential home is that it's gonna support like home kit and  the echo and  Oh, that's good all these other things. So it will be cross-platform. That's good. Well, so the way they did it is they  reverse engineered the public API's which I always caution people when that happens  That's great for early adopters, but for normal people they're gonna get really pissy when you know  Google or Apple changes their API their public facing API and doesn't tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essential and then poof. Yeah, that's always a bad way to do it  You want an SDK and you want to approved way of doing it instead of reverse engineering the calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So and I still have questions because they threw in home kit, but I don't know how they're gonna do that without a certification chip  so  mystery

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the other thing I spent money on this morning was the nest cam IQ

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You do first  Really? I'm a doofus  Giving you a doofus. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a goofus and a doofus. They see doofus. So we haven't seen anything new from nest in a while  But we'd heard rumors of this it's a 4k security cam  But you don't get nobody wants to push 4k over their Wi-Fi network. It but high-def is bad enough  You don't want to push the 4k. So what it does is and I've you know, there's the Mivo camera does this too  It has a 4k sensor, but it only takes a portion of the 4k sensor plus  They say it will recognize members of your family and let you know if the guy is creeping in the window  Is your brother-in-law or a bad man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That guy was clearly bad. He was wearing all black. Yeah, it didn't look good. Oh, but she's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what was this was this a mistake to buy this Stacy don't tell cuz it's expensive. It's 200 bucks  So no, it should have been 300. I'm sorry 300 bucks. The second one was 200 bucks. I bought two of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, so here's my take on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You do this. I'm a doofus

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, so is there better stuff out there is that what you're saying? Oh, yes, so it depends  If you run a really fancy camera and I  Have not seen the nest cam stuff like in my life because it's not out yet  So I might I reserve the right to come back and be like Leo. I'm sorry culture do this  But I think for most purposes  Though the nest the original nest works fine and my favorite camera. I happen to have it right here. Oh  That net atmo presents. It's not hooked up to anything right now. The net atmo presents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It costs it looks like it looks like a canary or something like that  Standalone camera devices. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, it doesn't have us. It doesn't have all the sensors like temperature and stuff  but what it does that is awesome is it does actual facial recognition and it has for years and  It also doesn't store this on the cloud. You can upload your files to Dropbox if you want  But the default is to an SD card  so what's cool about it is it recognizes members of your family and it does things automatically like when it  Doesn't see anyone it recognizes for a while. It's like, oh no one's home. I'll turn I'll arm the rest of the house  I'll arm the system. So  it's like the future in a lovely little camera thing that costs $300 and you don't have to send everything to the cloud and  If I were gonna look at the nest the only thing that the nest offers is slightly fancier like the  I'm gonna call it picture-in-picture. Even though it's not it's the ability to zoom in right on  Bad stuff or interesting stuff. We'll call it that and  Let's see. What else does it have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want the familiar face alerts, you have to subscribe ten dollars a month or a hundred dollars a year  Right. So yeah  So oh, yeah, or so again Leo. Yeah this guy  Well, I have to review it. I didn't I'm not like, you know, I don't you think I'm not it's I know it's confusing  Appears as if I'm buying this stuff and kind of putting it all in my house in the closet  But I'm review we want to review this so I'm buying it for review purposes just like the essential phone  Yes, that's just my job and I don't like to take free review units I like to actually try these things in in  Vivo I  Spend many many many dollars. It's expensive to keep up with this crap six core process  So I will look at the net that net atmo. I guess what we need you to do is a run down of all of these. Oh  Wait, is that an assignment coming? I'm gonna give you an assignment because well there's and then if there's not just the net atmo

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's also the canary, right? So I like the canary. I mean I've tested all of these so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which one do you like the best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for  Facial recognition and stuff. I like the net atmo the best  I think the array of sensors on the canary is really interesting and maybe more utilitarian  But if you just want camera and facial recognition  Oh, I have tried so I didn't love the canary flex because it didn't play well with my arrows  It doesn't play well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is another issue  Well, the neat atmo says it's a it's a healthy home coach a smart indoor climate monitor  Am I looking at the wrong thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a different thing. That's the temperature. They have a temp  They have an outdoor weather station and bring cool stuff and then they have oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, okay something else. So I want the indoor security camera with face recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  their outdoor security camera is really interesting too because it plugs into your existing light wiring and then it's got it's kind of  I don't know if I love the design but and then it when it detects motion that little light comes on  It's kind of like what the ring has with this outdoor camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is cool because the net atmo security camera will put what goes to your Apple watch and tells you who's who's came in  Lily just came in  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've been they've done this for so long. These guys have been really forward thinking about how to communicate with things like notifications  So like instead of I've detected motion and they're like, hey, I saw Andrew in the kitchen. You're like, thanks, dude

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's that actually is cool. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love how this and the Google stuff was shown is not is slowly but surely it's a conspiracy  making facial recognition, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And putting it in your house your house keeping an eye on what you're up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't I don't actually keep cameras in my house. I'll be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't look at how do you test these things you tape over? I test no I test them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have the camera area everyone in the house knows that the camera don't wear the wigs and costumes  When we tested the canary it was a problem because it's air quality sensor the part of the house where I had it it was  Like you're gonna die. It was just constantly read. Did you keep it in the garage?  It was like right by her front door  I moved it. They're like just try moving it. So I moved it and that's pretty funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're safer. So when you think was the outside air that was causing it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Alarm alarm it could have been  Just a vent blowing. I mean who knows that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barbecuing next door is it makes it? Yeah. Well, it's Austin. Somebody's always barbecuing next door. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so I don't think I'm that much of a doofus

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe I maybe I was a little excited for effect. Well, I know early adult

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know and this is why it's hard and with about the netatmo security cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the well, I know and they're French. Some people don't like them because oh, they're French

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We we  Okay  Don't you think though that a Google company like nest will do a better job of facial recognition? I'm is that just my own prejudice

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These guys have been doing it for years and they're perfectly fine. I  Mean  Yeah  It is I mean like I bet what's crazy right right now if like my housekeepers come in, you know  They're not for a while. They weren't recognized and then we recognized it because it was annoying but  How crazy will it be when your friends come into your house the nest recognizes them and then tells you who they are based on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google yeah, we have a very annoying neighbor that I would very much like to know when she comes in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does your annoying neighbor do she walks in or she walks into your house, yeah, you know Alice Kravitz

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of like  Mrs. Kravitz

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's a little she's a little here's the service Google  When this face appears call my phone and then you can be like, oh my gosh, I have an emergency. Goodbye  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go, well it's funny cuz we've never had any security at all and well we had a burglar alarm which we never we never arm and  I've never had any cameras in the house at all. And I don't feel I never felt any need to have cameras in the house to be honest  But I wanted I should try these I feel like every you know what it is. It's peer pressure everybody  Oh, you got to have a camera. Everybody's got cameras everybody our family has cameras  My father-in-law has cameras that is front is back and and my brother-in-law same thing and like they you can't hang out with them  Because they're always looking at their phone. There's somebody in my yard and it's like I don't want to know go ahead  Let them walk through my yard. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I have two camera use cases, okay that I love the Arlo's we put them upstairs on our roof  We have a roof deck and like when it's thunderstorm II like right now in Texas  Our furniture can blow all over the place  so sometimes we're like we hear these loud thuds on the roof in the middle of the storm and  I I've used the camera there to be like, oh  Okay, we're good. Nothing went over  so that's one and then two is we have doorbell cameras and those are nice because  you know seeing the packages and all of that, but the added bonus is it when my  daughter leaves when I'm out of town

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She always waves at the cameras like oh and I get a little alert on our my app my app  I kind of like that. You don't use ring you use. Well, who do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So right now I'm finishing up a doorbell camera review. So I have five of them  Really? Which is the bet? Which one's the best one? I can't tell you yet  The one I purchased and have normally is the August but I don't love that one. Okay, and there's skybell there's rings  Last year I said skybell HD was my favorite for the wire cutter. I remember this year. Yeah this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna shake things up a little bit. Oh, are you doing this for the wire cutter? Yep. We love the wire cutter. That's awesome  I love the wire cutter too. Oh good. So you can tell us what the best I  Mean, there's a I mean, there's a cut  There's a certain level that they all achieve which I mean  I love the idea that I could see when some I can hear when somebody's at my doorbell  I can hear when somebody's at my doorbell. I  Can see when somebody's on my stoop. I can talk to them all of those those basic features are really great  but I would I'd be curious we're you know, obviously we have a ring on ours, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'd love to know what else is out there. Do you have the ring pro or the ring ring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the original ring because I put it huh. Oh  I have to say they are a sponsor. Oh, yes. Sorry Carson's yelling at me. They're not a sponsor anymore. So I know  But they were at one point in time at one point they were responsive and they didn't pay their bills  so  No longer a sponsor so, you know, you got another one. Let me know  I guess that Richard Branson money doesn't go as far as you'd expect so  But I don't I'd like that basic feature  But but I'm curious if there's like one's better. Why would one would make one better than the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The biggest difference in them is the time it takes to have the image resolve and then the accuracy of the motion sensors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, cuz sometimes that's a good point cuz sometimes somebody will come to the door and it'll be ten seconds before I hear the them arrive  Right and then  Yeah, and then there's things like the bell  It has to be it has to be close enough in time so that you can answer  If they if you if you if you answer and they're gone, that's no that's not much use  But the end there's there a little bit at the mercy of the internet on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are I can tell you that my front doorbell the original one that I had hasn't worked for like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why rings as so well because nobody's doorbell works

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My husband is not impressed with me it's like I'm sorry, when are we getting a working doorbell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I need a doorbell. Would you stop reviewing doorbells?

Transcript:  That's good, you're gonna like it that's really good. Yeah. Yeah, we'll share share your nature box  Did we talk about I can't remember if we talked about Google contribute Google contribute last week  No, I don't think so. This is the one where Google and this is I thought we did maybe was on Twitter  This is the holy grail for advertisers Google now. Oh, yeah, we did we didn't know about that  Oh, actually, I think you said contribute. What is it? I'll tribute attribute. Yeah, sorry  This is an attribute  A tribute this is the credit card right track they can track they can tell they know so much about you  They can tell where a Google ad will stimulate a brick-and-mortar purchase  Terrifying I  Have to say I and I am you know up from watching the show the Jeff and I especially are Google fans  We love Google, but I do have to say after Google I owe  After this I'm starting to feel like I'm a little nervous  That  Google is everywhere in our lives and is becoming more and more knows more and more about us  I'm actually starting Jeff. Talk me down. I'm getting nervous about the privacy implications of Google. I am fine with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coffee V  It's it's it's a transaction is it is it is it worth the value  But here's here's the problem it's when you don't know so this morning Joe Scarborough was going on about  The privacy stuff being taken away and so so he is saying I don't like this  He told the story about how he started running for the first time in his life  And that he hadn't all he did was done was was tell me on the phone that he was running  He insisted there was nothing else. He bought the stuff ages ago. He hadn't searched for anything  I don't believe this but suddenly he got  Ads and said it's BS. Oh, yeah, it's BS. Not true  Right, but the point is perception. It's a coinkied ink  No, they got they got braces. I think he did do something. There was a signal. Okay, um, but but the problem is the perception is now  Even when they're when it is obvious when you know the reason when they're not watching you  enough people are gonna say they're watching me and  And legislators are gonna go crazy about this so I'm they've got to be more careful about  Both companies about letting you know what they do why they do it  And just be more upfront about it as it happens so that you're you know, you never get freaked  You don't get the creepy lines because it's it's valuable services. We love having this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they it seems if they're getting more and more data about us. It's good. Won't there be a  Backlash well, no a critical mass where they I mean just the fact that they can tell that you already have that critical mass Leo  They can tell you made a brick-and-mortar purchase based on a banner ad that was shown by Google  That so that's amazing and it worries me a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what we need and this is I say this every time and I will continue to say this until it happens  We really do need some sort of bill of rights around our data and our privacy  We have to have the government  Do this and I know it sucks  government government sucks and it's a painful process, but we need  we're gonna freak out until we have assurances and rules around this stuff and we are right to freak out about it and I  wish the industry would be a little bit more proactive about it because  Otherwise Google's gonna face a huge backlash and this is not  I'm not a person who's like yay government. Let's do it, but  There's really no other way we are in weird territory  And the information they have is scary a lot of people are unaware of it and what they are aware of is probably the worst-case  Scenarios, which just puts them all further  it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright, Stacy, how about  Don't forget right now. It's government that is getting rid of all protections  They're allowing your phone company to sell stuff this guy this government. I'm gonna do I am well aware. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's her it's her senators. It's corn runnin and Cruz. Yeah. Yes, they're lovely people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so  How could but I think?  there could be almost kind of a  Constitutional convention around this if you if you if you have a university and army to mine  convened people  Across various sectors of society to start to come up with standards for this  I think that's a legitimate thing to do  Because otherwise what's gonna happen is we will we will get the regulation that Europe brings

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it should be international. I mean these should be things that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want I don't want  China's Iran's Brazil's all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see this is the problem internet is international. Yeah, right, but there's no consensus international consensus on what?  Privacy should be protected and what shouldn't and as hard as that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So go ahead Kevin  So we tend to get the American rules rather than European rules  So the American companies will say well the way to do this is the is the way that we've considered it in America a lot  Of the time that is changing as their market markets move, but that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  status of things like ISP privacy, you know in the United States  We're dealing with two things right now one the repeal of the FCC  Decision to make ISPs ask our permission before they share our information with marketers and two of course  We're looking at a repeal of any net neutrality  Regulations, there's even a bill in Congress to force that  What is this? What is the status of that in the UK?  I know you're I know you're actually dealing now with not just the snoopers charter  But an even more draconian proposal from both the conservatives and the liberals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And well more from the conservatives than from labor  But that's that they're making part of the election campaign at the moment is is you know  The Home Secretary was on in the debate tonight saying we want to intercept more things and we want to be able to break encryption  And it's you know that they in some ways are asking for the impossible  But there was that that's the that's the position they've been taking for a while  the other thing that we've got is the the  European data protection directives that are coming through  And  The because of the brexit stuff UK companies are humming and harrowing about those but they're still going to come in before we leave and  it would make sense for them to  Follow the follow along with them anyway, so that I think that is that what you meaning by we're getting European regulations. Yeah  Yeah, GDP GDPR is that was called Kevin GDPR. Yes. Yes. Yeah, it may

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a really big law with teeth because it's a huge fine  It's like is it 20% of the people that are coming through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big law with teeth because it's it's a huge fine  It's like is it 20% or 10% of your revenue and or a minimum fine of like a crazy amount  I'm trying to remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey in my book public parts  not to plug that but  I argued that government  portrays itself as the as your great protector of privacy  But government is the worst threat to privacy because government has through the IRS and police and so on all kinds of means  to exploit  Your privacy against you  That no one else has  so they do but  Don't trust them. Sorry. I'm just saying I don't trust government to do it  And I think that that self-regulation from the companies themselves doesn't work because no one's going to you know  Facebook comes out with new privacy stuff and everybody's suspicious  So I think they're i'm agreeing with you and i'm not saying government shouldn't have a seat at the table  uh  but I think it'd be better if there were some kind of uh, independent organization that  The companies agreed to join in  uh and endorsed  self-regulatory standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I worry that the teeth there there's no teeth there the economic incentive to abuse someone's data or a group of people's data  Is pretty high  And so I feel like you've got to have a pretty big stick to beat them over the head with and self-regulation  The government should have rules allowing like dictating what it can access to  And we don't even have that  I was part of a I was part of a group of pardon me for this uh davos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh that that went through privacy and and and there were a lot of and so people like uh, vivian redding who have  Lambasted from the eu were at these sessions and others from the ftc and so on  And there was a lot of persuasive work there that says that advances we could make in um medical data  Could be thwarted badly  By privacy and that we have to also sell the advantages of sharing  That we can't just concentrate on what goes wrong  number one we've got to  Also look at the positives here so we know what we're balancing  And then number two  Balancing and then number two what was number two I had a number two. I swear I had a number two number one's bad  Was it?  Um, yeah, so so so we have to look at the advantages and oh I know we have to look at actual harm  The creepy line cannot be used as the basis. Oh, that would be creepy is meaningless  And is a dangerous standard. I just there's something about that. It's not a standard for regulation  So you have to go to actual harm  um, and and and and then I can start to get behind it, but again, I just  And i'm I know i'm sounding like a libertarian i'm not everybody knows and i'll get i'll get i'll get  Complaints on twitter tomorrow. I've been saying that i'm a democrat  um  But but in this way, I I have my libertarian streak that I don't trust government to be smart enough  to be a  Future thinking enough to understand it systematically  Um, but you're absolutely right the companies aren't doing it either  um  So I think we you know leo needs to call a privacy convention

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just glad i'm gonna be dead in a few years because I don't think there's a solution for this  This is just a mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is and I would say jeff I agree and there are efforts like to donate your data to medical science  And those kind of things are awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but you there's in that case you give informed consent. Yeah, it's no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not just donations tc. I'm gonna disagree there. I I think that that that that um  That's not enough. That's not enough data  Uh, if you have a confluence of cancer in a geographic area  um  Then you find out that there's an old hospitals you get that data from dr  No  No, it's it gets locked down in every which way  And and uh, no, there's too much fear of letting any of this stuff loose  So we don't compile it because of the fear of privacy because we've gone overboard with the fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is we have sold the benefits and called the recode project. Thank you kevin for posting this in the chat room  Policy recommendations for open access to research data in europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seems like a good idea, but is there is there support for this kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, there's I mean this this is one of the one of the things that there's been talks about in you know  Along with the gdpr stuff and so the the the researchers are talking about exactly what you're saying. They're saying  Just as you carry an organ donor card  You should carry a data donor card and say that your data can be used for medical research  And then we don't encourage people to think about it in those terms and then put some constraints about  You know  You know some corresponding things that make sure it does comply with gdpr  um, and you know the challenge is always  anonymizing it well enough and and that that's always been extremely hard because  For the data to be useful for medical research you need to have those, you know  You have to need to know that which hospital was it from and at which point you can get to the patient's fairly  Fairly easy and de-anonymize it again. So it's it's not it's not a straightforward problem  It is it is it is very hard to do but there's a lot of people trying to think about it  um the the gdpr stuff, I think  that's um  There's a bunch of pieces around that that that make a lot of sense in there and they're trying really hard to make these things  coherent  Um, but it's it's awkward when this is combined with the kind of of of surveillance stuff that the the the  The government is pushing here because that  That tends to be done in this sort of covert way that breaks all the rules and that has you know  That was the concrete thing where?  Hoarding vulnerabilities led to hospitals closing across the uk. I don't get the sense that gdpr is aimed at governments though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's aimed at in private businesses, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um  It's both

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I mean, what is what is the four percent of the annual global turnover of a of a government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point is the the the the rules and the thinking about it, um, is supposed to apply to government institutions as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This by the way is law and will go into effect almost exactly a year from now may next year may 25th

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you give up four percent of your revenue, yeah, if you're in violation, which if you're a large enough company  And you can get fine two percent of your records in order

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, this is going to be used as a cudgel you publishers are going to are going to are going to allege gdpr violations  Against facebook and google in a flash. I predict but some of this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I can't disagree with under the gdpr breach notification is mandatory  Where a data breach is likely to result in a risk for rights and freedoms of individuals within 72 hours  I mean look how long yahoo sat on its yeah, i'm fine with that. Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But did they know that you're stupid to know the right to be forgotten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one that's challenging because it changes the way the internet works data portability. I think that's a good thing  privacy by design  I think that's a good thing data protection. Well, that's that's an awesome privacy by design

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a really hard thing to talk about yeah, it is  So here's a question because this is something I think about a lot because this is such a thorny issue  And we've never historically we haven't regulated this way but with privacy violations  Should we be thinking about regulating by outcome in terms of like?  Like  And again, this is hard but like I know that if I donate my data to medicine  I'm cool with it going to help cure cancer. I'm really not cool with an insurance firm  Using that data against me to charge me more or just to deny me insurance, for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is where you there's there's kind of a blockchain of your data what permissions you've given complex  But there's a there's a possible structure there. Yes, I agree  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So yeah, because these are these are the things like when you use data for redlining you're like, well, that's crappy  But yes, that data is good for other reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's the caution stacy, but the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's saying hospitals are bad. Yeah, so if you know  If you the redlining thing is like, okay, which hospitals which areas are bad and is there bad coverage in particular neighborhoods?  And so you end up doing that in?  You do you know doing those that you need to do that kind of research to say actually this hospital  Has the bad treatment practices that we need to um  Attack and so you you end up having to have that kind of geocoding data attached to it as well. So  You know it and it does depend on yeah, it depends on  Transparency for the how the data is used as well  And that is that is much harder to achieve and it's particularly hard when you're using machine learning on it because you've  In a lot of the time they can't actually give you any transparency back  You know if you're using data to set policy  Um, that's that that's great, but you need to say how you're using it as well and that and then then you can expose the kind  of  You know treatment based discrimination or neighborhood based discrimination or you know pre-existing condition based discrimination stuff

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's the trade-off

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hard  Yeah, and and and and it's really hard to I think your your ai point is important kevin because  Because you know this data point has these conditions attached to it, but we don't know what we could learn from that data  in in future systems and and  Uh, you know part of what europe looked at was  Not limiting it when it comes to research  but then again  Private companies are coming google is coming up with things that can help people. Um  I I don't think it's just the the academic researchers are okay and google's not that's a wrong presumption, too  It's information at the end of the day. I think we have to keep in mind something here that  Information flowing freely in society is a good thing  Um  But it's not we need the conditions that enable it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, but it is not always it is not always well  It is not always a good thing forever. I didn't say always and that's  That's the challenge we have here is  information is not a benign thing it's its power and  Right now consumers and individuals have very little power over their information  And that is legitimately frightening for them because they are being manipulated. They are being  you know paying a price for things that  otherwise they may not and  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Blah gotta talk about the positives of information and knowledge at the same time  If all we do is concentrate on the bad that could happen then that's this is how we end up in this discussion  This is why I wrote a book about this because I'm so concerned nobody bought it, but that's that's another problem  I'll go read it  I'll send it to you. I'll send it to you. Um  because  There's a balance to be struck and the discussion now is almost entirely on the fear side and the what can go wrong side  And not on the positive benefit side that we that there's a societal benefit that comes  at some level

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is and I I talk about that a lot with like iot when people dis on iot. I look at things like  creating true energy efficiency across, you know neighborhoods and cities and there there's so many benefits  to applying this but they're  Those are those are hard  Those are hard to talk about when there are so many people trying to use it for perhaps material gain  and  Maybe we just need better publish publicizing of this other the positive things. I mean  I I don't know. I mean this is again. I agree with you. Jeff. It's super hard. It is really challenging. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is so kevin says did you see stephen fry's speech? What what did mr fry talk about he's  He's uh, the last I heard from him he was getting off twitter because everybody was mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he gave up gave a very long speech at the hayon wide book festival  About the future technology and gudenberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And oh no, I gotta watch it. I gotta watch it. He covers the 95 feces

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow  Oh lord, oh so jeff jeff would enjoy this but we may need to go away and read it and talk about next week or something  but it's um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Read it read it. Well, there's a transcript on stephen fry says there's a transcript. Yeah, I don't see a link to the transcript

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, I think the thing that there is a video but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he is you want his delivery. But anyway, go ahead kevin. Sorry  It is long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean the thing is that he was it's it's long but he was talking to a literary festival  Which is kind of the fun part of this. He's he  So he's talking to them about tech and being the interpreter of tech to them. So it's  it was um  And he doesn't come out with with a with a lot of great recommendations. He you know, he  He's his his answer is this is kind of hard as well  But we don't want to just leave it to the to the tech companies to think about this with the rest of us need to pay  Attention to I think that's the sort of high level thing of his  of his speeches and the the challenge is is that  We don't necessarily want  The reaction to how we use all this to be decided by  A small group of people who live on the west coast of america and that's that's that's that's part of this  You need to think about how else you use it as well  um  Because their their worldview may not match everyone else's and I think that's the I think that's kind of what you were trying to say  Stacey is that um a lot of  Data is good  But it's it's a lot less worrying if you're already relatively comfortable relatively powerful and it's much more worrying if someone  Can use it to have power over you and that's that's the piece that's very hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a just a little  excerpt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From his speech he's talking about I submit that it's nothing sort of scandalous to be in the middle  Of a general election in 2017 on the very brink of this awe-inspiring terrifying scarcely credible  But unquestionably real and imminent revolution and find that politicians are skating not to where the puck is going to be  Not even to where the puck is but as ever to where the puck used to be  Me Westminster's record is pretty grim in this  So  I would just say  You can argue convincingly that one of Churchill's greatest qualities  one which um  Helped him perhaps tide turned the tide of the second world war was his openness to science and technological development  As shown in the science museum exhibition a few years ago dedicated to his role in that sphere  The development of radar which he supported was of course a vital part of the victory in the skies in 1940  So now too was of incalculable importance in the battle of the atlantic  Churchill always listened to his scientific advisor lord charwell whom he called the scientific lobe of my brain  He got behind wonderful inventions and developments like the bouncing bomb and operation windows gyroscopes  And of course, he sent that famous five-word note  Concerning mysterious money that was disappearing into dollace hill and bletchley park and that the treasury couldn't understand  Churchill had gone to visit the colossus vacuum vacuum tube computer. Tommy flowers was building to help decrypt enigma  When he came back after having seen it, he wrote a five  word note  Give them what they want  That short note could be regarded as one of the founding documents of digital computing  But of course you could justly observe that so did hitler exhibit a loving and a belief in science  And that is of course true as churchill himself in one of his best notes speeches said  If we fail in the whole world including the united states  Including all that we have known and cared for will sink into the abyss  a new dark age  He's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was probably he's a professional

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coming out he should have played churchill

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to complain about the you know, the neutrality is technology will work for wicked people and for saints  as marshall mclellan observed it is as  To complain about it is as witless as cussing a buzzsaw for lopping off your fingers and complaining that you never saw it coming  The wick the witlessness of our leaders and of ourselves and I include myself is indeed a problem  The real danger surely is not technology but  Technophobic canutism a belief that we can  Control change or stem the technological tide instead of understanding that we need to learn how to harness it  Driving cars after all is dangerous  But we developed driving lesson requirements traffic controls seat belts maintenance protocols proximity centers emission  Standards all kinds of ways of mitigating the danger so as not to deny ourselves the life-changing benefits of motoring  We understand why ned lud destroyed the weaving machines that were threatening his occupation  We understand why french workers took their clogs their sabo as they called them and threw them into the machinery to jam it up  Giving us the word sabotage, but we know that they were in the end if you'll pardon the phrase pissing into the wind  No technology has ever been stopped  So what is the thesis I am nailing up?  Well, there's no authority for me to protest against no equivalent of pope leo the 10th for it to be delivered to  I'm certainly no martin luther. The only thesis I can think worth nailing up is absurdly simple  It is a cry as much from the heart as from the head and it is just one word  prepare  We have an advantage over our hunter gatherer and farming ancestors for whether it is winter that is coming  Or a new spring is entirely in our hands so long as we prepare  Unlike martin luther. I thank you for your indulgence. Thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stephen fry that's the code of his speech at the hay festival. It's an hour long. You can actually watch the whole video  We're we're yeah, we're we're on the bbc. Yeah, the bbc has it  If I just googled hay festival stephen fry  And especially the part of the transcript. Yeah, it's not that's not in the transcript

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, so the bottom of the treasure that link I just put in is yeah because uh, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the end of the speech, but I think it's a good it's a good coda to our discussion. I don't find it  Yeah, it's not it's not obvious what the answer is, but we but we still have to prepare

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, but but the but the thing the thing that I liked about it, um,  Uh, yeah, I didn't see all of it live but I did read the transcript was was his  Him saying we need to be thinking about this. We need to paying attention to this. This stuff is important. Right? Um, and just  reactively making your  Mapping it to your current talking points is is a is a shame and it's it's particularly a shame as you watch the uk election  Um progress that that's broadly what's happening with the tech part

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also encouraging and it makes a point and I think this is really great that we you know, we did do this with uh with  cars  That there is a there's a precedent for this. It's as as intractable as this seems to me  You know, we've done it before and and we do need to do it  We can't just sit and let it just happen, uh, which we have spent what happens but decades thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Our government is stupid. It's incapable of doing things and that it's bad  and it feels not that we're as naive maybe as people were in the 60s, but  If we expect better we might be able to get better and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't agree with maybe i'm stupid but no it's a hard argument to make right now though, isn't it stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it it is but like this is why i'm not leaving like there's there's so much of me  That's like let's abandon ship and go to europe or canada or somewhere. I can but I can't because  Because I have faith in people I I have to right. I don't know and I do think that government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the only chance for solving this is government, you know, I understand your your caveats  jeff  But who else and government?  In the in its best sense reflects our interest as a society and it's our interest in society that need to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Protected this is where eric schmidt would say would you rather have government run google or google run google?  And I would rather have google run google

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's a false argument. Yes, it is. It's specious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead stacy  No, that was all I was gonna say. Yeah, it's specious because google can run google, but it can't run google without any unfettered  There should be no, I agree with larry page wanted to move to an island because he didn't like anybody to say tell  Google what to do, but that's sorry google exists in a society and is let's not use the word. You know  Let's use the word society google exists in a society society has

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Differently, oh  It's well right now. They're different because government is imperfect privacy rights more than anyone has government right now  That's taking away all your privacy. Well, the the point of an election is to find out what people want  Well, yeah, we're there voted exactly why uh, you know, I again i'm a liberal  But in this case, i'll trust  the market more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well only because you don't like what the people said, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because no no no this goes back further because I believe that right now  The the key change here  And this wasn't what would google do?  I mean i'm in plug day  Was that that that  now that everyone can complain loudly about any company the  Of the the public forget market for a second then the public's ability to  Keep a company honest is greater than it's ever been  And if you are this is the this is the genesis of don't be evil right being evil is bad business  Because you'll get caught and it's going to be trouble  uh, so  There there are I that's not to say that I I I agree that we need  Uh a little broader discussion with more constituents with more guidelines possible with more opportunities to hold somebody against a known  Standard I agree with all of that  But I do think the market is in better shape now to fight back against companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I get back against

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  companies companies companies  Badly behaving companies. They are if they know the market has no solutions for badly. That's why we have antitrust law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The market is no solution for poorly behaved companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bill o'reilly would okay bill o'reilly is a very different thing and he's been  He's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the press there are even the most conservative people agree that there should be antitrust regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm not arguing with that leo i'm not arguing with that, but this is the essential solution here

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not antitrust, but there's so much happening that people don't know about  That the hard stuff think about all the good reporting that goes on that people don't pay attention to because it's  God, it's so boring. Um, but those are the kind of things  that public outrage doesn't solve because it's  Esoteric it's hard. I look at things like pharmaceutical pricing lack of markets for vaccines or new antibiotics  Just in that one industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, that's why journalism should exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, i'm not saying that journalism can't do it alone  Like I looked at the texas tribune in in texas  They did this amazing thing about half a year ago about a child  exploitation in sex workers  our legislature went in  And just did nothing about it despite the fact that this is  Great journalism about it  Completely there were actual things that could solve it in our legislature was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can always bring up counter examples, but what but sure so  I'll try to depoliticize it by using society instead of government does us do we not as they're not society  I understand do we not as a society?  Have an interest in  Protecting our interests against  uh corporations corporations have their interests and we have our interests and do we not have a right as society  To say to corporations. Okay, you can do this. Yes, but what are the mechanisms to do that?  Well, that's we only have one mechanism government is a reflection of society. I understand. It's not perfect  But what else is there? No, we also have market-based solutions

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Market doesn't market is market doesn't care about consumers unless you're in a are you an adam smith market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, i'm saying there are multiple i'm right now right now  The thing I am so distrustful of government at this second. This is the irony of this, right?  And i'm gonna get such crap people on twitter. Relax. You know, i'm liberal. Just let me be liberal. Okay, i'm me  This isn't even liberal. This is you're saying it's the invisible. I am I get all kinds of crap  Leave the tech leave the politics off of twig. Let's go back which is fine. We can do that in two minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're quoting bill o'reilly now  I don't know who i'm talking to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, i'm not well, but here's no there's a paradox here. The paradox here is that  Forces one and that's why I don't trust government

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, the reason okay, but they don't give up jeff. Good lord  You're gonna end up on an island in the middle of nowhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But don't give up on on the public and on the other mechanisms don't give up on the on the public pressure that can be put  By by by the people by the public don't call the market on government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't give up solely on government. The government is a tool of the people a government is a tool of not handing it all over to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and look I gotta say stacy  Your your point about privacy is right, but look who's ruining privacy in the united states of america today. It is the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're the ones who to go away it's data brokers. It's uber it's a lot of people and the government is enabling them now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government is not protecting and the worst fear of course is a collusion between private industry, especially google and facebook and  uh maybe  And and government that would be the worst case scenario  I agree. I mean if we have a government that is and and we kind of do have a government at this point that is  Uh run by money in other words run by big corporations  It doesn't do a very good job of protecting societal interests, but I don't know what other tools we have  You think that consumers could just rise up. I don't see consumers saying i'm not going to use google anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, okay  I I was a I was a teenage libertarian. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that like a teenage werewolf that's an intellectual horror movie yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, yeah back back in the in the uk in the 70s there was this like  Government is doing too much the the trade unions have too much power  There's there's a big problem with with society running and at that point the libertarian point of view the the high ikean market free market  Point of view was not getting much of a hearing and it wasn't a attractive alternative and that was  That gave us  That gave us thatcher and reagan  Picked up a version of that and um and it it it's  Solved the problem of  Trade unions having too much power  But we're now at the other end of that cycle and we now have these the situation where the corporations have too much power  And they have the same um  Lack of empathy with normal people that the trade unions had here in the 1970s  And so we're having this weird election going on here now  where  there is the you know, the the neoliberal consensus that  Um sort of blair took on board from the conservatives and said the way to do this is to encourage the city to do the right thing and  um  To do that rather than to nationalize everything that consensus has broken down and the and the labor party is campaigning strongly on a  um  a nationalization on a more control of the of of services  By the government because people see that corporations aren't doing a good job of it and that and that is getting a lot of resonance  That you know, they've picked up a huge um  Swing in the polls once they once make all the election and corbyn started putting on tv and saying these kinds of things  So we are seeing a swing back  Against that neoliberal consensus and it is wrong putting a lot of us because we you know  We're used to that idea of the markets delivering  But at the same time we can see these these kinds of flaws where people have too much power  Um, you know mark mark refatcher famously said the trouble with socialism is eventually run out of other people's money  Um, but that's kind of where we are with financialism eventually  Eventually the city runs out of other people's money eventually the venture capitalists run out of other people's money and these these things start failing as well  and  You know, we need to we just step back and say  How do we balance these these two points of view and and what it comes down to is how do we think about?  um  How about people and how they're how they're treated and not chase the abstractions too far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I was just trying to end on a high note with stephen fry but I obviously stirred up

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's get back to worshiping technology. Please segue for you. So here's here's the segue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see if we want to pick this up before you do the segue. I want to do an ad so I have some capitalism  But tell us what your segue will be and then i'll do the ad and then we'll do it  I was like your ad's gonna mess with my segue. Oh man. There's you got your segue in my ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here here's here's an example of the private interests  Not necessarily aligning with consumer interests as reed hastings talked today at the code conference about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His changing perspective of net neutrality. Oh, wow. What did he say? Oh, well, we'll find out after this word  That's not a segue. It's a tease. That's a really good tease now i'm dying to know what happens  Our show today, how about a little capitalism? I'll just mix it in here with a with a little corporatism along with that libertarianism  There's a great guy who is an absolute capitalist. His name is jay walker  You probably know him as the guy who created priceline if you don't now you do  He I asked him when I talked to him. I said are you the guy who hired william shatner? He said yep  Jay's a great entrepreneur and and as with the best entrepreneur entrepreneurs, you know, he sold priceline  He can't he can't take it easy. He decided after his non-completes wore out. There must be another area that we could  You know disintermediate there must be some thing that's not working in the world and travel that we could make better and he found it  Business travel if you're in a big company  You have a travel department you call them up. They make your travel plans for you  They have pre-negotiated prices with the airlines with the hotels  The company likes it because the company knows it's going to get the best deal  You like it because you don't have to do any work. It's a win all around but if you're not in a big company  How does it work now you're doing your travel booking  The the company itself maybe isn't real happy with what you've booked first class all the way  And and you're not getting the advantage of pre-negotiated rates  That's where upside comes in jay's new company upside.com the better way to buy  business travel upside  Is very simple pick your pick your destination  It'll now what's nice is they've got pre-negotiated prices with a variety of airlines  And a variety of hotels  It will offer you the best six deals right off the top  Now if you want more you can do more all curated you get to choose the hotel you get to choose the airline  You get to choose your flight time, you know, there's no mystery here. The other thing you get  You get a gift card  Now if you're the owner of the business you can apply the gift card right away and save even more on your flight and on your hotel  And on your hotel, but if you're booking for your company for your travel the company's paying for it  Company's going to get a great deal, but you can keep the gift card and gift cards  Can be 100 200 300 more if you're traveling overseas and it's good cards with great companies like amazon  target  Nordstrom 50 of the best brands you'll get your gift card within 72 hours after booking your trip  It's a win all around you get a gift card your company saves and you get great business travel plus  24 7 concierge level customer service  You can call them email them chat with them reach out on social before during and after every single trip  You're going to save hundreds your business is going to save hundreds you get a gift card. It is though  It is a great idea the best way to book business travel  upside.com get a hundred dollar minimum gift card on your first trip by using the promo code twig  That's minimum. You'll get at least a hundred dollars if you use the promo code twig on your first travel  That's upside.com  promo code twig  Save big on travel and get a big gift card every trip minimum purchase required see site for complete details  upside  dot com  All right, stacey  What the heck are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So netflix ceo reed hastings at the code conference  Said that basically net neutrality  He's not that he's not big on it this time around because it's over big enough  Well, he says quote. It's not narrowly important to us because we're big enough to get the deals we want. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So basically he's like  Thanks for last time moving right along  bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geez, well, it isn't all right. Well, stacey. It's fair. It's not his battle. It's fair  but you would think that as somebody who  Came up on the internet that he would like to keep instead of pulling the ladder up after him  Keep the internet free and open for the next guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've been big enough to do their own peering agreements for years. Right thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Once they had that big kerfuffle with comcast they and they won that and did their own peering with them. They're like, all right  We're good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  although wasn't it comcast that  Turned the dial down on netflix to squeeze them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what they did? Oh  Oh, all right. So what they did is they blocked certain ports, right? And then they also had they didn't buy more cables. They did  They they didn't connect more ports for them, but they they did say when comcast so netflix said hey  We will offload this stuff for you because we have our own cdn boxes that will hold our content  So this doesn't even have to be a problem for you  You've got so many people will just stick our boxes in your data centers near the customer  Comcast was like no  We don't want to manage other people's boxes if we do it for you. We got to do it for everybody  meanwhile comcast comes back to them and is like  Here you can stick you  You can send all your traffic to the following two data centers to serve our entire user base around the countries and netflix was like  Oh hell no, that is not a good deal for us and that's super complicated and expensive  And so then they got in this massive fight it was highly technical  And the bottom line is the fcc started to get interested because they were like dude guys work this out  And I think didn't john oliver do something on it, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, yeah  I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was very excited because I was appearing nerd. I am still appearing nerd and  You want to talk about the open internet? That's a complicated subject man. If you understand that i'm impressed  Nanog conferences, I love them  um  so  So basically the point now is  You know netflix and comcast they've done their deal  Yeah, they as you said they're pulling the ladder up behind them  It's frustrating and even  In dc in talking to people about this like at south by southwest  They were like no one wants to expend the capital and this this is not an issue for google and the guys who fought it last time  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's sad because it's uh, and in fact  I mean it affects twit  it uh  It affects uh the next twit  Anybody who uses the internet? I mean I can easily see a situation where?  Comcast says well it won't cost you anything to watch netflix or amazon  But if you want to watch a video podcast from twit, well, we're gonna have to you know, that's that's that's another matter entirely  We're either going to slow it down  Or we're gonna it's going to count against your small bandwidth cap  Um, I and and forget twit I already you know, i'm already made my business. What about the next guy who's just starting out?  yeah  keep our netfree which is a uh, a pro net neutrality  Uh website has created it's a little bit of a propaganda  chrome extension  Called a removal of net neutrality simulator  If you want to install it  The net gets slow all of a sudden when you go to facebook it says maybe you'd prefer myspace  when you  You know, uh, should I add it? I don't know. It's gonna screw up my internet really bad  Okay, so so let's uh, let's let's see what want to stop the internet from becoming a reality voice or concerns  um  Let's see if I what happens. That's a little thing. Okay. Yeah, let's see what happens if I go to facebook.com  Is it giv- oh this website does not function correctly on your isp service, please use myspace instead  Now I don't that's a little bit agit prop that's I don't think it's really gonna be like that  But it's going to be much more subtle and what's bad is it's people aren't gonna even notice I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's a historic joke in the um, if you remember who bought myspace  Um, but that's you know, it rupert murdoch, right?  Rupert murdoch who owns both tv companies and and net switches. So yeah, yeah  But  Okay, so  I'm not sure if this is fully related, but it is it is kind of um  Connect it joins the thread back. So there's a bit and it's another uk theme thing. So there's a story  Um coming on in the uk at the moment in that  The top song on the charts is going to be not be able to play it on the chart show  Because it's oh a protest song called the prime minister a liar. Yeah  um, and and the so this is an interesting thing where it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's number one, even though it got no radio airplay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's what it's number one. I think it's I don't know which is quite number one itunes yet  But it's I think across because they now count itunes and youtube plays and social media things in the charts  Um, it's going to be number one in the charts and they're not going to play it on the radio  Because they're in an election and they and they've got a duty to not play partisan songs

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why they're not playing it. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's like a fairness doctrine. Yeah, we didn't we we eliminated that yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No this I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the way it works here is you can't buy airtime  Um, but there are rules about  Um, you each party that has is feeling enough candidates is given party political broadcasts that are put on the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I can play it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a mission to make britain a country that works  Not for the privileged or not for the few but for every one of our citizens  together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We is that nigel farage?  And that's um, of course that's boris johnson  I don't think you'd have seen this on cnn if it had been hillary either  She's a liar liar  Number one on apple's itunes charts apparently captain scar she's a liar liar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean  I'm not sure how that quite plays into this and it's an interesting, you know counterpoint to  You know the difference between the the way things work here and here and there  in the states  They would have played that as a as a commercial, you know, right?  Yeah, absolutely  They would have said yes will play as a commercial here  It's a it's a grassroots thing that someone has put together on youtube and people are buying it because they find it funny  And this is a great british tradition of that as well. There's there's a whole christmas number one thing we can get into

Um  Sidelight on how privacy actually can help  Turns out an interesting study at harvard  When wikipedia switched to https  Which made it impossible for governments to see what stories you were reading  It it turns out there was a direct connection to less government censorship  Because governments don't want to block all of wikipedia  They would like to just you know block the  Articles about tnm and square well, I guess turkey doesn't mind blocking at all  But there are most countries are censoring bits and pieces about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, mostly they want to censor a particular thing, but they end up blocking all of it. That's because right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh the the study after a painstaking this is from motherboard painstaking the long process of manual analysis  potential censorship events the researchers found that globally wikipedia switched to https had a positive effect  On the reduced in other words the number of censorship events  Because they can't see into what you're looking at  right  So there's an argument for uh for privacy  Uh when governments don't know what you're reading they're less likely to censor it  Chipotle says most of most of its restaurants  I think you might want to say all of its restaurants were infected with credit card stealing malware

So I I I bought a  Mail signing certificate from global sign. So i'm gonna search for global sign and then under more I can make it per let's get personal  I'm gonna get personal and then you could show this is nothing  It this is in my gmail. These are this is the back and forth with global sign

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Haven't they done? Okay. So gmail is different, but haven't they done something similar?  like I know sometimes when I search for things it gives me like  information that  Based on information they have about me and it's like only you can see this results from google products gmail google calendar and google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're mixed one boxes in that do that for a while. Yes  So if you search for someone in your contacts, you um, you'll get you'll get their phone number  But it says this isn't a google result  This is from your contacts, so they're the kind of thing and it does a bit more on android as well because android is  the search  the google app there has  Insight into bits of your phone that is necessarily there on the on the web version  But yeah, they've done this for a while, but they've been making it a tab just for that is interesting  I think that's okay that's saying oh this this is  You know, this is this is actually searching your gmail actually searching google accounts and it's giving you a reason to have a google account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As well, it's the other half of that. So I searched for a comcast and on the personal results. There's a bill  as well, right purchases  Uh as well as comcast email  And if I had a I think if I had an appointment with a comcast technician that would show up there too if it's i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they could be like unroll me  And I could say eventually. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry y'all  Sorry, um, I could be like  Gee, how much did I spend at amazon and it would be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's services that will do that if you sign up for them go through I know like unroll wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we haven't talked about google and its inability to  Discuss how it pays people and we need to do that. Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's sorry. I'm not letting that go. No, you're absolutely right. We gotta mention this. Um, yep  so, uh  You want to tell the story stacy while I uh, I pull up the link

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, so well, I may not tell you the history the history  the department of labor  Is suing to get data from google on how it pays female employees because it's concerned that it is  Paying them less and is discriminating against them. I don't remember the law it's using

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but google  Says, um, we can't give you that information. Here's the story from the register  Which of course in its typical snarky way snarky google can't spare 113 seconds of revenue to compile data on its gender pay gap  Uh google said if that it would cost them a hundred thousand dollars  To to figure out whether they underpaid women  Um to compile accurate wage data to compare women's income to men's income would be 500 hours of staff time  So, okay  I don't know. You know what? I have a feeling that the labor department's not gonna accept that excuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we'll see but but you know, no one in Texas has an excuse either and google is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ex-googlers is definitely mocking them. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, they spend 150 million. They have 150 million dollar diversity program

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like how much have they donated to girls who code or black girls code or right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean students spend that on it  but how much have they spent on the salary of the hr manager who who's completely failed to  Improve their hiring practices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do we I mean do we know if google pays women less than men? That would be a shameful thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I think that's what they do is that is the thought process and this is the data they're trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, um broadly they do yes measurably, um, and it's it's similar to the  to to other companies in that they um  They hire women at lower lower wages at lower slots they promote them less well and  The attrition rate is higher  So fewer men end up as managers google does have some from senior women has had a lot of senior women  But their promotion system is has has been bad. Um, kelly ellis has written about this a few times and said, you know  you know concretely  the  The system that they use doesn't necessarily  Um  Because it uses performance ratings and existing um  existing salaries  It means that any bias that starts is baked in is continued. So  She came out of college and was hired into into front end development because because she was a woman  Even though she had experience in back end  Because they they decided that would be the right place to put her right she didn't know  Um, and then  To actually get through the promotion process you have to you have to show that you've overformed and so on so the the actual process  Is it's very difficult. I mean she's there's a long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like there's a long series of posts that she brought up the department of labor  The department of labor said the investigation is not completed  But this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at google headquarters  So  Uh, they're looking for you know more evidence from google google says well  We can't afford to compile that information for you, which sounds to me like a company that has data data data

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds to me like yeah, it's like  We don't want to really google. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a federal contractor. So one of the issues is as a federal contractor they're required  To give the department of labor access to records and information about compliance. So that's that's one of the issues  Um, so google has to as as a governmental contractor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like you can index the entire web, but you can't actually look at your own employee database kind of hard to believe. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of hard to believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is the challenge and you know, hopefully the government doesn't let them off the hook and I know I know google is not the only one but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You but the funny you would think google of all companies would that's why this is so interesting  Equally and not and be merit focused and not gender focused and and look at a coder  I understand really probably some some of this anyways is what you were saying kevin, which is it's just  It's just kind of a quirk of historicity or maybe even you could blame the previous employer because well, it's just bias still

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bias. It's and and it  It's great that they're going after  Yes, I was gonna exactly google nobody google is like we are not going to pay women equally  right most people at google are probably like but yeah, they need to  they have to be forced into wreck it like realizing this and doing something about it and  Then you know, because if you can say walling is not the solution google. No, it never is. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean it is it is more complicated than than  Equal pay equal work. It's also more opportunities for women minorities for better hire jobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So how you analyze this is on both fronts promotion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Churn things like that. I mean there's right. There are tons of things that I mean as a woman who has worked in startup environments in tech  There are tons of things that can push you out  if  If you don't have the support network at home if you're not working with people who are actively supporting you and trying to push things ahead  I mean there are a million days that you can wake up as a woman in tech and say you know what?  I just don't want to deal with this bull anymore  and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to say that my wife makes more money than I do. So  I mean I you know  But the funny the thing is you do you'd expect google of all the companies to be like bending over backwards  Yeah, this is I took this picture at google io when you sign up for your badge  They say we care about your pronouns add a sticker to your badge  To tell them whether you are they them or she her or he  They I mean it's uh, they they they act as if they are really open-minded and really care and really progressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they're you know, they're trying you know, they they they have an internal culture that is is trying to build this stuff  Of course, um, and you know the women in google groups and the gaglers and all those kind of organizations exist  but at the same time  They think that they are  Naturally immune to this because they're so rational and don't and don't you know don't introspect it and don't actually measure it very well  And that's why that's why I was thinking to kelly's thing because kelly was saying exactly this  Um subconsciously they would decide that  the um, you know the guy who looks like me is is is a better coder than the guy who looks than kelly who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's here's here's google's cfo who is a woman ruth porat answering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh caris swisher at the code conference. I'm gonna ask is about the google salary, right?  Why will not you pay a hundred thousand dollars? Whatever? Why will you you won't give this information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To the federal government so I think what you're asking about is the department of labor has been through their federal contracting office is  Doing an audit about gender pay equity. We are very committed to gender pay equity  we've done a ton of data analysis and looked at  um at job families and levels and  Based on that have said including equity because that's really including equity  Absolutely full comp and based on all of the analysis are very comfortable confident saying we we don't have a gender pay equity

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, i'm so glad for you to say that but why not release it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so we have given the department of labor hundreds of thousands of records millions of data pieces of data  And the lawyers at this point are saying, you know  This next round of request is actually looking for personal contact information from thousands of our employees  and our view is that uh, it's too much and so  Uh, you know having given them hundreds of thousands of records and millions of data points our view is that  Uh, they've got they they have what they need and we're leaving it with with the lawyers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you have all this data proving this why don't you put up a big splashy website explaining how great you are?  I think we have I mean the way we've done our actual I mean you guys like data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty certain you like data. I mean the data we've we've looked at again looks across  It's it's job family level  performance rate the whole host of things and it's on that basis that have you ever thought of releasing that data to people to show this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's one of the arguments was we didn't want to pay for it. Is is that they did do a report by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh gender they do a diversity report in a gender equity report. Yes, they don't they release that information of some kind  um  Good for cara for digging in on that but I I think maybe uh, Ruth porat's responses  Uh, well now well no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry go ahead go on kevin no god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, yeah, she's she's she's giving the company line the party line, but she's not but  the challenge, you know, um  Someone at google started compiling a spreadsheet of internal salaries  Um and breaking it down by gender and race and google shut that down so fast  You would not believe and the woman who started is no longer working at google, right?  Because they're really really sensitive about it because it doesn't actually line up. Well, yeah, you remember that  and you know, it happens over and over again and the the the challenge is it's not the  You know, you can you can always find one or two, you know, um  Supposedly count as I'm like the cfo is a woman and you know  And and so on but if you actually look at the experience day to day of all the employees  It doesn't work out that way and it's very hard to  To show that without actually having the conversation with the people who've suffered under it  Particularly in a company that is all is all about  Yeah, as you say it's it's per its internal image is that they don't do this kind of thing  So when this kind of thing does happen people get away with it because they think that couldn't possibly happen  right, and and the stuff that the  Susan foster talked about at uber  um  Is more way more egregious than people said at google  But but the same kinds of things and the same trends are there and it happens at a lot of these companies and it is  Is a structural problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, what were you gonna say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, basically less eloquently exactly what kevin said  So there we have it and if we if we want to solve the structural problem  Jeff we're gonna go full circle. We're gonna have to go back to the government government and we're gonna have to do things like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Child care is important. Yeah department of labor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but you do that you do that if you you know you the you  Existing laws you have to go to congress. You have to do things that that um, yeah, I mean, I don't I don't I don't  I don't argue with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says it is so good. It is so good at uh at machine learning  That that it is now blocking 99.9 percent of spam and phishing messages in gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, it's also blocking a lot of other things. I don't I I still see spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get a lot and lisa gets a lot of those messages. Hi, my name is uh is uh,  Ramundo, what you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My favorite is google blocks the white house because I signed up for the white house emails  So those actually go into spam for me and i've never done anything about it  So i'm guessing other people are like you could reverse that you could reverse I can't no  But the point is like if you don't check your spam you're gonna get them it  It sends all kinds of crazy stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to google 50 to 70 percent of messages that seems like a broad range  But 50 to 70 percent of messages gmail receives their spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so if they're only blocking 99.9 percent of them, there's still a lot of there's still some get through

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Messages left. Yeah, I think gmail does a very good job in spam. It does I do too

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love I love gmail as a product. It is a wonderful product. I even pay for it  I have the same issues jeff does because of that but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep  Oh, so do you want to tie that up to the people using?  amp to get around this  Oh, no, really they're using amp to spam  Because amp has a google.com address. Yeah. Oh no because they're caching things  It was the stories some of the the fishes are  You know putting up their their amp site marking up with them getting caching the google cdn and then sending that link to people  Jesus  Oh, it's this is something but I can't I can't find it now. Hang on. I do I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, you'll be happy to know I turned on amp on my wordpress.com. Oh my yes  Well, it was just a little plug-in and I checked the box and that's fine. So it's there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so I want your your view on this so so publishers have been been begging  Facebook and google's been pushing facebook to  Recognize the amp standard and facebook took a step that way today, but it strikes me as one way not the other way  you can publish instant articles on facebook and then  hit buttons to have it go to  amp and  Instant articles, but I think what people were asking for was kind of the opposite as well that that instant articles  Would be amp compliant. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think well, it's basically around you look at it. So  Facebook has a tool that lets you generate instant articles and now they're also generating amp pages  Yes, so it's um, that's nice  So you're saying that they should also read amp pages and present those inside facebook, which I think what if what if you're already set

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Up to make amp pages in your cms, which you can do right wordpress leo's example wordpress. So  He sets it up to automatically create amp but that doesn't do him any good in terms of getting that into instant articles  So you want it to be compliant for that way right you want both ways  Well, it's a nice thing facebook did i'm not denying that  But I could imagine in leo's exact case  You wanted to go the other way as well. No, yeah crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that makes sense. I think part of it is that amp is slightly more general than instant articles  So instant articles is you have to put these particular bits of markup in and then we'll recognize it as an internet article  whereas amp is  Here's you know amp is more if you put any of these up these bits of markup in it isn't amp. Otherwise it is amp  so  So one thing the other thing is actually centered

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And amp has more functionality. I mean, I mean instant articles has more available functionality than amp does  amp is a subset of both html and the census and articles so that i'm not sure that's really true. So it's an instant articles. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as I recall it is  Their own sort of subset of browser functionality that they will use to render it in their in the facebook style  But you have to mark it up with a set of classes that says or a set of elements even  So you have to have a certain set of elements in it. Otherwise, you won't recognize as an instant article. It'll it'll fail the validator

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

So, uh, even though the court can't do anything uber has fired him  So fifth amendment doesn't work just a little tip in employment matters can't plead the fifth
