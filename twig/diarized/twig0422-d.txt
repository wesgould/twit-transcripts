Blogger, Buzz Machine, author of many a book. Good to see you.  You survived September 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it still send a chill up your spine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't done it every year, but I went there and do that.  Yeah.  I took pictures of the spots where I was when the major events happened.  Do you do that every year?  Not every, but almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. Have you been in the museum yet?  I don't think I can do it.  Yeah, I was talking to a firefighter. He said the same thing.  Really?  Yeah. It's very emotional. It's really emotional. I was in tears most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Besides health conditions, the one big impact on me personally is that I am now, this is really weird.  I've never said this out loud before, but I find myself almost unable to control emotions in ridiculously manipulative tear-jerker moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? That's not the 9-11. That's age.  That's age.  I think that's age.  It's the same thing. And remember George H.W. Bush. He was very teary. He would cry. I cry at everything.  At least he goes, stop crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like being a pregnant woman. I'll just tell you. When I was pregnant, I cried at the drop of a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have the belly for that too.  Very emotional. But it is a tearful thing to go there and see the melted fire truck. It's funny.  It's not the people who are the victims in the building as much as I really get choked up when I think about the rescue workers, the FDNY and the NYPD that ran into the building.  And the priest who's giving last rites and then himself got killed.  Those things really start the waterworks. It's a beautiful museum though. It really is well done. But it's made to make you cry. They have phone calls. They're playing audio from phone calls. It's very heavy.  But what a beautiful memorial. So you go see the memorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've done that. I waited a while to do that too.  Because at first when you went, it was worse than airport security to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Now it's wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey, we missed you. Stacey Higginbotham is back from her jaunt to Intel, right?  Cedia and Qualcomm.  Qualcomm, Cedia. How was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both were very illuminating. I learned a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Qualcomm is in it. And we should mention Qualcomm is now a sponsor. They have ads on our network for their Snapdragon gigabit LTE chip.  And they also ran ads right before the Apple event.  They're in an interesting tussle with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because Apple stopped using their chip to build their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Apple doesn't use any Qualcomm stuff anymore, right? Not even the radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. After that lawsuit and licensing fees.  Although they might... Does the iPhone, if it falls back to CDMA...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they're using CDMA radio, they have to use Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I assume you still have 3G and a Verizon to iPhone. So unless they fall back to nothing, which would suck, they have to be using Qualcomm chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Qualcomm had a blog post, rather, in which they...  I should show you.  Android Firsts. This was the day before the Apple event.  Brought to you by Qualcomm.  Of course, there was no surprise really what Apple announced we had already seen in Leaks.  So they're responding directly to the features Apple is going to be announcing tomorrow, the day after this blog post.  Fast charging, quick charging, dual camera technology, iris head authentication, facial recognition, fingerprint under display, augmented reality, depth sensor.  This is all stuff. OLED display, 4K display, gigabit LTE.  This is all stuff that Apple touted in its new iPhone X.  And it was all innovations that appeared first in Android, thanks to Qualcomm.  I think that's really... But they're locked in a major lawsuit.  Yes.  Yeah. Withholding payments and all sorts of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think... And here's a question. And when I talked to Qualcomm, this was mostly a tech visit.  We did not discuss the lawsuits because they can't discuss the lawsuits.  So you can smile and ask and they will say, hey, we can't talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a different building.  Would you like to go there right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But China, when they started fighting this and then South Korea again went after Qualcomm for their patents and the licensing fees they were charging, it kind of opened...  It opened the door because Qualcomm actually, to get into China, had to accept some of the constraints.  And so then, of course, everyone else is like, oh, hey, I don't want to make such high patent payments to you too, or high licensing payments to you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay. Qualcomm has had a good run as a licensing company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they... I mean, it's not like they're a patent troll. They didn't buy patents and then sue over them. They're all things they invented, right? I mean, it's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, they invented it, but they also were very strategic in buying companies that have patents as well.  Okay.  And the question is basically, are they fair and reasonable when they were under the state?  And it has been years since I've delved into the Qualcomm patent wars.  So there are issues of what terms did they participate in standards organizations with, since they have only these patents, are they licensing them fairly, et cetera, et cetera.  So there's a bunch of really nitty-gritty legal stuff there. It's not as exciting as the stuff I talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it really isn't. And there is no legal definition of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory patent terms. That's something that people just agreed to.  It's a voluntary commitment, not a legal commitment. So you could say, well, they're not adhering to FRAND, but that's voluntary.  And maybe they feel their licenses are worth more. I don't know. And I wouldn't even want to weigh in on this because I don't even know if they're adhering to FRAND or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because you would have to. So it is to participate in certain standards organizations. You have to be like, yes, I will. They establish a FRAND benchmark.  So, but I don't know again so long since I've dealt with this. And they also, I believe they bundled some of their radios.  They integrated some of their radios. So you had to buy and pay licensing on, which is another issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they would argue. Yeah, well, it's a system on a chip. Of course, we bundled it. You want us to unbundle it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what Qualcomm does. They take a system on a chip and go, whoosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why you get such a great deal and so much power because it's all in there. It's all in that system.  Well, anyway, so I'm glad you had a good time. And I'm surprised you didn't stick around for the Apple event. You could have killed two birds with one stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to come home and see my family before I went gallivanting off to Vegas next week in San Francisco the week after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to Mobile World Congress in Frisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I'm doing an event for some friends of mine in San Francisco.  And then Vegas is a user group for an industrial Internet company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You work hard. Aren't we impressed, Jeff, at how she is an intrepid reporter?  And an entrepreneur. Yeah. Well, that's right. You kind of have to work harder if you're doing it for yourself, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I put all that hard work on to Andrew. That's his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you're doing all the reporting. No, you're doing it all. You're doing the work. I'm impressed.  That's why we have you on because then I could say, well, Stacy, what's going on? What does this mean, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us. Only on the IoT or 5G. No, no, no, no. That in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So did you both watch the Apple event? I watched it while working out.  That's perfect. Perfect. And that Apple watch then said, hey, you're heart rate is abnormally high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have an I'm not an Apple girl. I am. I am not that lady. So I do see more and more Apple watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I was actually quite impressed with the Apple watch improvements in the series three, including cellular.  And you can make and place phone calls, make and take phone calls on the new phone.  It also has some additional fitness stuff that people will welcome.  Things like calculating your resting heart rate, monitoring your sudden acceleration.  It will warn you if your heart rate's gone up and you don't seem to be moving. Things like that.  I think that's all great stuff. I think it's it's and it you know, they announced this is a very unclear,  very appley kind of announcement that they were the number one watch company because I noticed that number two was Rolex.  So it was clearly not unit sales they were talking about. Must have been dollar sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they are. They are the top in the fitness tracker market.  They took a lot of market share away from Fitbit. Actually, a lot of people took market away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but that was my reaction seeing the Apple announcement is that's it. It's over for all the other fitness bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is I mean, there will always be people who don't want to buy into Apple's ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to buy an iPhone to use it. It's not usable with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I right now. Oh, guys, my phone died right before.  Oh, so what are you going to get? I don't know. I've got my spare iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can wait a little bit. I guess because I think it's I think it would behoove us all to wait till October 4th or 5th whenever Google announces the Pixel 2.  That's what I'm waiting for. But I am in love with the Note 8.  Really, it's a beautiful phone. It's big. It's it's it's tall. It's not wide.  And it's a little bit bigger, but not hardly at all bigger than the S8 plus.  It's just a tenth of an inch bigger diagonally. Does Lisa have one?  She's an Android. I mean, an iPhone person. She's not an Android person.  She has an iPhone 7 plus, but that's a five and a half inch screen.  This is a six point three inch screen in almost exactly the same size as a seven plus.  No, but it's the same size as seven plus. Well, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But guys, your pockets are bigger. So you're like, I can still stick in my love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The seven plus. She's she's completely happy with it. She likes a big phone.  She likes the the cameras in the seven plus. I do, too.  This has dual cameras as well as very similar in some ways to the seven plus.  Has a live focus feature that's kind of interesting.  Let me see if I can do it upside down and backwards.  So it zooms in a little bit and then it has a slider.  I don't know if I can actually do this, but I can bring the background into and out of focus, depending for the portrait.  Oh, and you do that live. You know, that's Apple has that in their portrait mode.  But then Apple leapfrog them. Then one, the iPhone eight, eight plus and ten will have a new lighting mode, which is really cool where you can change.  Isn't that amazing? Yes.  And I think the interesting thing about that is in order to do that, they took part of that new A11 bionic chip.  They took a chunk and said, this is going to be for the camera.  And that's where Apple has an advantage over over Qualcomm, over Samsung, over anybody.  They designed their own silicon. Yeah, maybe they started with the ARM platform years ago, but they have a thousand chip designers working at Apple.  And now they do their own GPUs. This is the first year they've done their own GPUs.  And they design their own silicon.  And there are more than a billion transistors in this A11 enough so that they could say this part here, that's the camera.  So they dedicate hardware, silicon to camera processing.  That's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's actually that's the way things are going now in general.  So Qualcomm, if you look at its drone reference designs, they've I mean, and I just know this for a fact because I was sitting there talking to them about their chips.  But everyone is designing. There are certain core features that you're going to design into silicon.  Your camera has been there for a while.  What you're going to start seeing next is DSP is dedicated to voice.  So wake words, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, Apple mentioned something called an ISP as well, which doesn't stand for Internet Service Provider.  Is I what was it? Is it a machine learning chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was. Yeah, that's their that's their AI chip, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, yes. So that's this is what's interesting is you now have so many.  It's an image and signal processor or no, it's yeah, image and signal processing group.  So you have so much extra silicon because the dies, you know, we've shrunk the die sizes down so much.  You get so many transistors, you have enough room to dedicate parts of the chip to different processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is fascinating. Well, it's more I mean, it's so essential because when you're opting, I mean, at this point in time, we don't need more gigahertz, right?  We're not we're not optimizing for performance. We're optimizing.  Well, sorry, general performance. We're optimizing for battery life and performance.  So what happens is it makes sense once you have a function that is integral to what your device is.  So a camera on a phone now is integral. You wouldn't buy a phone without a camera.  OK, like five of you might. But it makes sense to say, OK, let's put this in hardware so we can eke out the most power savings for the best quality.  And that's exactly where we're going. And it's super fascinating because if you talk to the chip guys, they'll what they're designing today is the stuff that five years they're believing is going to be integral to your phone.  Maybe four years. It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I love it that there's a competition between Apple and Samsung and Qualcomm.  Yeah, you know, Google and yeah, Google doesn't. Google is not making these chips. Google's using Qualcomm.  I wonder if Google will, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my speculation and I could be proven wrong or not proven wrong. I might just be wrong.  Well, that would prove you wrong.  Yes, Google is they have to be investigating making their own chips for cell phone.  I mean, they've done it on the for embedded for cell phones, but also for things like IOT type stuff.  So they've got where they have their hardware. I feel like they've got to be doing something there.  Chromecast would be, I guess, a good place to start because they sell so many because you do to design your own silicon.  You really need to have massive sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, look at this story from your former colleague, Yanco Rutgers.  Google in June hired a veteran chip architect away from Apple and is now looking to build its own chips for future versions of its Pixel phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that gives it the ability to control security updates the way that like Apple can.  So you could they could keep the phone working or secured and supported over a longer period of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is Manu Galati, Manu Galati, who had been at Apple for eight years doing chip design.  He is now Google's lead SOC architect system on a chip architect.  So I think that pretty much tells you you nailed it. Google is going to make their own silicon.  I wonder if we'll see that in the Pixel 2. That would be very interesting.  They always said that the Pixel was a rushed kind of stopgap phone.  That wasn't what Google really wanted to do.  No, seriously, everybody's very interested.  The one rumor I really hate and I hope it's not true is that they're going to abandon the headphone jack on the Pixel 2.  Oh, God, no. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's that's it's so nice to have competition among features like that.  Like I like my headphone jack because I never remember to charge all my stuff.  And I know that Apple now has their charging math that one one day they finally have charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but it'll work. The iPhone is using Qi now, so it'll work with all the other chargers you have.  This has wireless charging. Actually, this has wireless fast charging.  They use dual voltages to speed up the charging on the Note 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, is it that they don't have a Qi chip in the AirPods?  Is that why they don't charge on the charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The AirPods, which also use it. No, they only use cable charging.  So what Apple said is they showed this mat, which they may or may not ship next year.  There's some issues with it because some of the features of it are not yet part of the Qi spec.  And they showed it with an iPhone on it, an Apple watch on it.  Yeah, they both use inductance charging.  But the AirPods and then they and then they said with the optional AirPod wireless charging case, you'll have to buy a new case for your AirPods for wireless charging.  I do. Do we like wireless?  It's funny because there was a period where people were making wireless devices and all my devices use wireless.  And I bought a lot of wireless things. And then it's felt like it was going out of fashion like, oh, it's too inefficient.  It's too hard to do it right. Let's go back to wired charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is inefficient. I mean, it takes much longer to charge.  And this is like two years ago when I last tried a Qi mat. So it's gotten better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's gotten better. And as I said, Samsung on this Note 8 has a fast charger, wireless charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, we'll see. And I mean, because when you the the double this, what's it called?  Quick charge, the like half your phone in 15 minutes kind of charging Qualcomm quick charge.  Yeah. So that who that's great. You wouldn't want to compete with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, so well, if you could do it wirelessly, I mean, this is OK.  So one of the reasons thrilled Apple is using Qi charging a because unlike it's very unappley because you would expect they would use Apple charging.  It's incompatible with anything anybody else is doing. But they didn't.  Which makes Qi, which was already the de facto standard power mat was starting to lose ground.  It makes Qi the definite winner. And now you're going to see I suspected airports at bars, which is great because there is a real disadvantage to plugging in your phone or your device to some stranger's USB port.  That is very risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hasn't Starbucks had that for years now?  And I don't recommend it. I've never seen it.  No, no, no. Why?  You'll see them everywhere now because I've never seen I've never seen somebody use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that funny? I've used it, but you had to.  So the other thing is you had to have a mat on your or you had to have capability on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if it were built into the bar and anybody when you put your phone down on the bar, it's just getting a charge just because it's so I can't make the sign table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think of all the uses we had.  Go ahead. Ikea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ikea has a side table that does this.  It was either Hilton or Hyatt in a couple of its hotels had bought furniture that allowed this.  I wrote about it when I was at Fortune.  So, I mean, this is a 5999 nightstand with wireless charging.  Yeah.  So it's just it's slow because it's been hard.  One, we had to get the standard.  Then you had to get everybody to put it into their phones and everybody's like, we'll do something when Apple does it.  Well, it's done. It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So now, yeah, I had somebody in.  Have we aired that triangulation yet?  Carsten, it's coming up.  Probably while I'm on vacation, right?  I interviewed a guy who is working who founded a company for wireless charging based on gallium nitride technology.  You remember for a while, everybody was all excited about gallium arsenide was going to change chip manufacturer.  It turned out not to be very easy.  But gallium nitride is you still use a silicon silicon semiconductor.  That's a well-known, robust technology to make silicon wafers.  But then you apply a thin layer of gallium nitride on top of it.  And what it's it makes it almost a superconductor.  It makes it so it's eventually going to change the way we design microprocessors.  But for now, it's being used for fits for field effect, transform, transformers for amplification.  And it's and he it can be used for wireless charging.  And he showed he brought in we had a table that you put anything on anywhere on that table.  It will charge. I mean, a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is who is this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the company name?  What was the name of it was something power something.  We have to look it up. Why do you know him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I have had people pitch me the gallium nitride story.  You brought a ton of stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know you brought a ton of stuff in.  It was working. I know.  Efficient power conversion.  You think it's bogus?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the science is there.  I think the challenge with any semiconductor process technology, which is what this is, is.  You have to get buy in from the foundries.  You have to get buy in from the manufacturers.  OK, so I agree. And this is what he's answered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I said he says it's the found.  No, it says the foundry is unchanged.  We can actually add a little shed off this effectively off the side of the fab.  The fab is still doing silicon.  Everything to say that's the beauty of this.  You don't have to get a new substrate.  You're still using silicon.  And then we just take the wafers and we spray them with gallium nitride.  And then we put it in through the red.  I mean, he's building stuff now.  So I really think this is.  But the point being, you're going to see he had a drone.  We were charging at distance.  So the drone would hover over a charger and it would charge, which was pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing.  Yeah. So this is.  Did you stick your hand in the middle of it?  And have it not get warm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said the reason he said it's not recommended.  The reason that these wireless chi chargers are fine is because it's it's not just blasting power like that.  It's like a little Taurus or something.  You know what? It's inductive.  Yeah, it's inductive.  So it's not it's not doing anything to you. Right.  Anyway, I'm excited.  I don't know why wireless kind of went through this this dip, this down cycle.  The new Google, the pixel doesn't have wireless in it.  Apple's never had wireless until now.  But I hope it does come back because it's really convenient when you get in bed just to put your phone down.  I have a little easel.  I put it in. It just sits on there and it's just really convenient.  And I don't care if it's going to take a little longer because it's going to be there all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, and that's that's the and if you have enough devices that have support for that, it's amazing.  Because you can just be like, do, do, do and just leave them there.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're arguing that if you didn't need to plug in the phone for charging and you don't you don't have a headphone jack.  You have to plug it in for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure Apple would love to get rid of everything.  And you're right. If they don't charge, the lightning port would be gone.  I. Why not? USB-C.  Yeah. Well, because that's Apple.  I know they have they have so fragment.  OK, I'm not going to get on a high horse here, but they are so fragmented their line now that it's very confusing.  They use USB-C on their computers. They use lightning on iOS.  They have fingerprint readers on some of their phones, but not all of their phones.  They have headphone jacks on some of their phones, but not all of their phones.  It's just the user interface when you don't have a fingerprint reader changes because you don't have a home button either.  So they literally make now their newest high end phones, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 have different user interfaces.  On one you press a home button and another you have to slide in different up, down, left.  It really is fragmented. And this is not good for users.  It is not a good way of doing business.  And it surprises me because Apple was famous for being the company that said, no, we're going to do this, this and this.  And that's it. I fear for them in the long run.  I mean, obviously they're going to make plenty of money, but I fear for their eternal souls in the long run because I think they've already lost.  They lost me on laptops. They have screwed up their laptop line.  They've pretty much screwed up their desktop line.  The iMac is still a very nice desktop, but the rest of them are not.  And they're about to really, I think, screw the pooch on phones, which is stunning.  Well, what are consumers? Look, if you're going to buy an iPhone, which one do you buy? The 8 or the 10?  The 8.  Because of the price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good God, man. That is a freaking expensive phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so is the 8. I hate to tell you.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not buying either of them. But and face ID feels kind of gimmicky.  And I think a lot of people net out the 8 for normals.  And then there'll be some people who live in Silicon Valley who will go the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have learned not to bet against Apple.  You just watch the iPhone 10 will be the fastest selling iPhone ever if they can make them.  The real problem is I don't think they can make them very fast.  They've got problems with manufacture now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe. Hence the great pricing.  No one will buy this phone for a thousand dollars or twelve hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But why is a thousand dollars such a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight hundred dollars was a bad thing. I feel like six hundred dollars.  This Note 8 is nine hundred thirty nine hundred sixty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, I didn't I didn't want to buy it at that price, but I got a trade in because I had the Note 7.  And so I got it for four hundred, four hundred bucks.  Plus, I had a trade in my old phone, but I didn't mind that.  I just I like this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You only have a certain amount of budget or normal people who do not have a lot of money or who have a normal amount of money.  They have to make tradeoffs.  And if you're looking for I'm just there's here's the good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are ample excellent two hundred to four hundred dollar Android phones.  And now you can get an iPhone SE for three hundred forty nine dollars.  What is it? Three twenty nine, three fifty.  So the lowest lowest price brand new iPhone is three hundred fifty bucks.  So there's the good news is there are all of this technology has trickled down and there are very, very good and expensive phones.  The Motorola G5 is an excellent phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what do you really miss if you buy one of those phones versus buying one of the top screen and camera?  Yeah, that's it.  You know what? The screen tells me everything.  No, it still works. Camera.  Same apps. Absolutely. Absolutely works.  And the camera. Yeah.  Better cameras always nice, but is it worth five hundred dollars?  I think a lot of people go buy a heck of a camera for five hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a lot of people feel like a decent cameras find that's just really a casual camera anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Although as like things like this portrait mode, I got to say, like, that's pretty crap.  Now I can't I cannot take bad pictures with an iPhone.  And so now when I take my normal bad pictures, which I do all the time, people are going to be like, really, Stacy, are you living in a hole?  Do you not do not know that this exists?  And now people are going to it's just up in the game in a way that I just don't want to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's kind of what I'm thinking is that at some point consumers are going to kind of bridle at Apple.  Maybe not. There's no history of that.  But I mean, I would not bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Darn it. You're giving me such a nice feature that I should be expected to use because otherwise my photos look like crap.  I mean, really, that's me being kind of lazy and I will still do it.  People, but you won't pay a thousand bucks.  No, I will not. It's kind of like when manicures became everyone has them right.  I still don't have a manicure because I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to pay for that.  But now I look at when I go places, I'm like, oh, I'm like, one of the people pay for a fifteen hundred dollar oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, OK, because I have to. It's priorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Priorities. Because food is life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll pay for a lamp you can talk to.  But but but I actually spend it goes elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually do find that that's true that people who say I'd never pay a thousand for an iPhone will gladly pay a thousand for something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just what it's whatever your price is the device I use more than any other device in life.  So I'm OK with paying by the pixel forty five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't pay that way.  No, but if you but I mean, seriously, think of it if you amortize it over the life of the phone, let's say it's a couple of years.  Forty five bucks a month.  Mm hmm. What is that?  Listen, it's like a buck twenty five a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And actually, if you if you look at the cost per usage minutes of that phone, Stacey, versus that oven.  Yeah. Oh, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much toast can one person make?  By the way, I tried a recipe I did.  I did the cauliflower in the June.  Oh, yeah. It was a little soggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you do the you can't say he did it wrong because the oven did it for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would have cooked it longer to because I maybe it's just me.  I like my cauliflower roasted cauliflower be a little bit more mine gets kind of burnt.  See, I want to burn. I like the caramelized when you put it in there.  Well, I just important to dry your stuff.  Oh, really? Oh, maybe that's what went wrong.  Oh, yeah. When you watched it, I just watched it.  So maybe it was. Yeah. Don't put damp because that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cauliflower's. Yeah. Cauliflower's real sensitive to that, too.  Damn it. The oven should have known better.  I you know, we'll we'll ask them to stick an extra sensor in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just say, wait, is this steaming?  Dry it. Yeah. Did you dry it yet?  Of course, that's right. That's exactly right.  No, they need a little blow dryer setting.  Well, it is convection. They could do that.  Blow out the steam there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, wait, OK, not on the June.  But let's go back for a second because I think it was a fast company article.  Maybe it was VentureBeat that asked if the they were like the iPhone 10 doesn't come up with a new metaphor for computing.  And they were sad about that. Did you see this article by any chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's quite a burden.  Isn't it a burden? A slab of glass that has to fit in your pocket.  Where's the new metaphor for computing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, they were like 10 years. That's what we need.  But I will say, I will say, I think they kind of showed it in.  What I think what I think and I did a little of this on the podcast.  I've been thinking about it a little bit more is with the iPods, AirPods, sorry, AirPods.  And the watch today, that watch is not great because it doesn't have a lot of talk time, et cetera.  They freed us up from carrying our phone everywhere.  You're still going to bring it to work or something like that.  But when you walk the dog or maybe you're just running out to the corner store or you just don't want to pull out your phone,  you're going to start leaving it in your bag more the same way.  I remember back in like 2008, I think it was at South by Southwest.  I suddenly noticed we shifted from everyone being on their laptops at the event to everyone just charging their phones.  So you'd see people instead of sitting on the floor charging their laptops and doing their stuff.  They were sitting on the floor doing everything with their phone.  And I think if you think about metaphors for computing.  That unless you're in content creation, because that's why we all still have laptops, that that's a really interesting possibility.  We'll go there. It needs to improve. But I think that's kind of where we might be heading.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you don't call this the new metaphor for computing, I don't know what is.  Animojis, my friends.  All right. You know who's going to do that? If you really want somebody reinventing computing,  Samsung has said, and I hope that this is they're not just blowing smoke.  Samsung has said that the next note, next year's note will have a foldable screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be a new metaphor, wouldn't it?  OK, no, that's just having a foldable screen.  It can fold back on itself.  It can. So imagine something the same size as the phone that you could put in your pocket,  but that when you needed a larger screen, you'd open it up and it would be maybe seven like a tablet.  What about that? Huh?  Now, how much would you pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's still just a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but that's I think that's well, you're right.  I mean, I guess if you make the screen a Windows desktop, it's not a new metaphor for computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually not a new metaphor, but it's cool.  I'm not I'm not lying that it's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a pretty big I mean, if you came from another planet, if you came from another planet  and you saw us arguing, is this better or is this or that better?  You'd say, well, but they're all glass slab rectangular glass slabs.  What do you mean? They're all this.  What's the difference? It's like Angel.  How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?  It's a completely silly academic argument.  These things are so similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So think about a new way to there's a there's a new way to interact.  So the phones represent about the new way to interact with computing  and new opportunities for computing because they had always on GPS that you could track.  Right. And voices change things, right?  The ability to voice voices doing a similar thing, which voice is part of this.  Like the upcoming metaphor for computing with computing embedded throughout your right.  Not embedded in your body, but you won't even around screen.  Well, that's that is my thought.  Your screen is going to become the same way, the same way that I have to pull out my laptop.  If I want to write a blog post, your screen will become something that you pull out  only when you need that functionality and you'll need it still quite a bit.  But it's going to be less and less in your you could do everything soon from not everything.  Most things from your pods and a computer that sits on your wrist.  And maybe also talks back to your phone for pulls from your phone for extra compute power.  I don't know. Next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last thing the last thing that changed the the metaphor of computing was the iPhone 10 years ago.  Yeah. The last attempt at it was Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Google Glass, it was just before its time, because imagine a pair of spectacles  that look roughly like your actual glasses with AirPod style audio and speech in the temples.  Camera heads up display, augmented reality, heads up display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something before. Yes. But something that is before its time has not successfully changed computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, the Nokia talked about disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at the Newton. The Newton was a flop.  But predicted everything that has happened since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, Nokia had smartphones and I remember vividly sitting with, you know,  executives at Qualcomm about like tablets. Right.  They we discussed the iPad before the iPad was even a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So long tradition. In fact, that might think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One changed the the metaphor of the slate was the Go computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I buy it. I buy it. There's a long tradition of very clunky, poorly implemented attempts to do what only later technology would make possible.  And I think that I think that the Google Glass actually is going to be we'll look back on it much like we look on Newton or the slate and say with a laugh.  Yeah. Yeah, that was a good try. But time wasn't ready at Holo Microsoft HoloLens is still not ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all right. QCat. QCat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a sign of the times. I have it. I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The single worst business presentation I ever went to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think would you now you like a smaller phone, Stacy, right?  So you're not going to get the pixel to XL. You'll get the pixel to the little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll get the smaller of my options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  October 5th is supposedly the date. We'll find out.  Google has not said.  I think I think that will be the end of it.  And you can at that point make a reasonable choice between the options.  I think the LG V30 is going to be another one to look very closely at.  All right. Especially if Google doesn't have a headphone jack.  Does he? I hope the LG. Let me see if the LG does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I have this is my phone that died.  I have the Nexus 5X that LG screwed up so badly.  Yeah, this was actually my replacement that just died like literally in my bag one day.  I pulled it out and it was like done.  And I just I'm too lazy to actually get to do it back for a month since I have a spare phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So. So that's me.  I would also look at the V30. I'm trying to find out though.  Yeah, it has a headphone jack. See, that's going to be that.  That's going to be the effect. The for people who need a headphone jack, the pixel to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll go back to this with the chart. You really could.  Apple could eliminate all orifices. I feel that they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel that. Can we not call them orifices?  I'm just going to put that request. It's just a fancy word for a hole.  Yeah. Why don't we just call it what it is? Ports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can call it worse, actually. I think hole sounds worse. I agree. Ports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. Ports. So if you if you care about if you care about learning about 3D printed  self-folding electronics. Yes, I do. What we're what we're just talking about.  I received today an article from the Applied Materials and Interfaces publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get such great magazines at home. That's such a good magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It is. I don't think it's. Yeah, I can send you here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll drop a link. Stacey, your new Applied Materials magazine has arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait. Quick, give me that.  If you don't know how things work, how can you talk about it?  Here, I'll stick it under Stacey's thing.  I know nobody's going to read it, but by golly, I am.  By golly. By golly, I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't have to read it because you did. So tell us what's in it.  I haven't read it yet. Oh, when we were talking about the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is I literally got it today. It's on my it's in one of my tabs.  All right. I'm loading it up. 3D printed. It's pretty complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Self-folding. Well, you didn't mention self-folding.  You don't. Yeah. So yeah, this is this is really cool stuff. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Composites that self-fold have so far relied on using the stimuli responsive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mechanisms focusing on reversible shape change integration,  integrating additional functions within these composites can.  Oh, so they're going to have different shapes depending on their function.  Yeah. Wow. I mean, once you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is cool stuff, right?  Upon peeling from the print platform, you can see the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The composite self shapes itself using the residual forces resulting  from polymer swelling during the layer by layer fabrication process.  As a specific example, electrochromic elements are printed within the  composite and can be electrically controlled through its folded legs.  Our shape transformation scheme provides a route to transfer planar  electronics into non planar geometries containing the overhangs.  My God, how do they ever think of that?  How do they ever think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an academic paper, guys. Let's let's let's all know it's printed flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then when it's removed from the surface, it goes and assumes a shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that cool. Yeah.  Did you ever read Ken Lue's paper menagerie short story where in his he folds  origami shapes and they get up and walk around.  You could create those and that would be neat.  OK. All right. Sorry. The future is cool.  We'll move back to the present because there's Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would like to live in the future. I'm just saying there is lots of Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Let's take a break.  And then we'll get a future without bodegas.  We'll get to that. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to talk about that. That story is amazing.  And more in just a minute.  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT, the IOT podcast dot com at gigastacy  on the Twitter, because she was with Giga for so long.  She's still got the giga in her.  Oh, I do have a mouse thing over my door.  Yeah, that's ours. We put that there for you.  It's a new it's a new hook hanging on the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's not chrome like all the other looks so realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it moved. Oh, my God.  Now it's on you. Get it off of me.  Get it off of me. Also with Jarvis, he's at buzz machine dot com.  I have no idea what's happening. Yeah.  I don't put a put a mouse on him.  That's all right.  We are brought to you today by Rockets Mortgage.  Put a mouse on your mortgage.  Quicken loans is one of the best lenders in the country.  Realize that the mortgage process really wasn't keeping up with the times.  It was directly out of the 20th, maybe the 19th century.  You had to go to a bank, beg in hat and hand and say, please, sir,  can I have some money to buy this house or can I refinance my house  and take some money out of it?  And then he would go and look through a bunch of fool's scab paper,  thin paper and search for the best rate.  Maybe, you know, he'd then say, all right, well, here's what we'll need from you  and give you a laundry list of documents you have to find or beg, steal  or borrow from your bank and other financial.  This is all history. History.  Thanks to quick and loans, they've invented Rocket Mortgage.  It's an entirely online mortgage approval process.  You do it directly from your phone or your computer or your tablet.  And it's fast.  You don't have to go find papers because they are, you know,  paired up with all the financial institutions.  So all you have to do is share your financial information by touching a button.  And then they crunch the numbers and based on your income assets and credits,  they will come up with a home loan option or two or three for which you qualify.  You pick the one that's right for you.  And all of this, thanks to computers, took minutes.  You didn't even have to get up from the chair or you didn't have to leave  the open house where you're going to make that offer because you could show  the realtor your phone that says you're approved.

We thank you so much for supporting this week and Google couldn't do it  without our fine sponsors.  Well, we could.  We just have to charge you.  Which would you prefer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.  Keep this business model alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's I think we've talked about this before.  It's but I think you said something and I really like this.  It's fundamentally democratic to have ad supported media because it's free.  It is. Yeah.  I mean, all you have to do is give it your attention.  But, you know, you got to give up something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's blood in the water in Silicon Valley.  I thought this was a very interesting think piece.  Ben Smith, its editor in chief, pointed out that it is I for a little bit thought it might be a golden age for Silicon Valley and mega corporations because of their being there'll be no antitrust prosecutions under the Trump administration.  Or will they?  Well, perhaps they will.  Steve Bannon and Bernie Sanders both want big tech treated in as in Bannon's words in Hong Kong this week.  Public utilities.  Tucker Carlson and Franklin Four have found common ground.  Even the group no labels.  I'm reading from his column.  An exquisitely poll tested effort to create a safe new center is on board.  Robert Murdoch never shy to use his media power to advance his commercial interests is hard at work.  Antitrust is back, baby.  It started with Yelp complaining that despite a 2012 consent decree, Google continues to scrape photos from the Yelp site and put them in its business listings.  They want an antitrust case against Google and they've gone to the STC to ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it started long before this.  If you if you look at things like Europe and GDPR, that is.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  That is absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I feel like Ben says this leads to a kind of murder on the Orient Express Alliance against big tech.  Everyone wants to kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's totally add in Europe.  And I've been trying to write this and it's impossible to write without setting horribly haughty.  But but but we talked about last week on the show a little bit.  But what the hell? I just never stops me.  I don't sound haughty. You've always been a haughty.  It's OK. Exactly.  But but with so much in their control, with so much power, with with the future of the Internet control, they've got to go head over heels to be decent.  And it wasn't sufficient to say, don't be evil.  The motto should have been do good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think Facebook is Google actually tries, you know, Facebook, on the other hand, has been pretty shruggy about it all.  So I think I think Google with don't be evil very sincerely for a long time really was trying not to be evil because they were aware of what kind of future they could build with access to all of the world's information, which used to be.  Is it still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I make it accessible and always for the record, the News Integrity Initiative, which I started, got a lot of money from Facebook.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I caveat done.  No, I think I think that Zuckerberg when I interviewed Zuckerberg years ago now, no, he honestly earnestly believes that a connected world is a better world and getting more people to connect with each other and create communities and working communities is a better world.  So I know I think Facebook has a mission to how well they do with their missions is a different question.  I think they need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think now Zuckerberg is doing the soul searching necessary.  I don't think Zuckerberg was malicious in.  Well, actually, he kind of was a dick.  If you think about why he created Facebook in the first place, but I don't think you're assuming that this is the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  None of these things are assuming that this is because of the malfeasance of these corporate titans.  It's just the public opinion is turning against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think people are becoming more aware of how much information these people have, how much influence there is, and they're also feeling alienated in ways that are probably very confusing.  So when you think about how people are rewarded in the faces they show on these sites and how how not true they are and how intrusive it becomes to maintain that facade, I think people are becoming a little bit more.  Aware of the it.  It's not harms.  It's just of the permeation of the stuff into.  Yeah, but I also think Stacy there.  What what what Ben Smith's article does is it makes clear that there there are a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are also a lot of enemies with agendas who are hanging up, and those enemies include media who think that Google and Facebook stole what God gave them in revenue.  Yelp, which is a competitor.  Murdoch politicians.  That's how this always goes, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to.  I mean, to take down if you want, if you want to regulate or put some sort of governance on what Facebook and Google are doing or the other big tech companies.  And I actually don't think that's a bad thing.  You're going to need this kind of murder on the Orient Express come like group.  And is it does media have an agenda?  Oh, yes, they do.  But I think it is a Facebook.  That's where we split.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think I think that if government if you imagine, pardon me, that's just how politics works.  Government's regulating those companies.  Thus the Internet.  I dread that.  I dread any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dread all government regulation because we have to dig through so much crap.  To get to the real issues and things that might actually help individual people.  And I'm always going to be for the individual consumers in every fight.  But well, let me ask you this.  That's an interesting starting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no I mean, the power of capitalism is that when somebody becomes wealthy, makes money, they reinvest it.  They make money out of innovation.  They don't.  It's not a zero sum game.  They don't become.  And I think you could say this is the case with Google, Facebook, Amazon, maybe not Amazon so much, but certainly Google and Facebook.  They added value.  And that's where all that money came from.  And all that power came from was adding value.  It wasn't they took it from somebody else.  So everybody acknowledges that these are valuable entities.  They provide value in our life.  But there's also seems to be a growing awareness that they have become so big.  So big that they have too much power now.  It's different for each one.  But let's use Facebook as an example.  Margaret Sullivan in the Washington Post.  This is again from Ben Smith's column wrote, Would Donald Trump be president today if Facebook didn't exist?  Although there is a long reason of list of reasons for his win, there's increasing reason to believe the answer is no.  And the more we learn about the Russians very effectively using Facebook and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's where there's a bit specious.  That's a bit of a specious argument.  Is it OK?  Yeah, it is because because, you know, would that's from the left without radio, with X exist, without TV, without whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But radio, TV or industry, Facebook is a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we used to have fair fair.  Is it the fairness doctrine?  Yeah.  When we were talking about political parties, I mean, TV and radio.  Back in the day, you had to publish.  Is it the fairness doctrine, Jeff?  This is my media law classes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the fairness.  But but but I have to say there's a difference between saying I don't want to shut down radio and TV because that's shutting down industry.  But and saying there's a company that one company that wields too much power.  Well, the president's not on Facebook presence on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's remember is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we're having this debate about like Sinclair with its pro Trump agenda and letting the FCC FCC approve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unless we sound too left wing on the other side, many conservatives say that these companies, Facebook and Google are fostering a progressive agenda that they don't like.  So it's that's the point is it's coming from both sides.  Now, there's a general building consensus that these companies are too big.  There's also a general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, interrupted.  There's a general the institutions that are challenged by these new companies and by this new reality of the Internet are fighting back because they're challenged because they're disrupted.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I understand that you're talking about newspapers, for example.  I understand that.  But that's not the only place this is coming from.  It doesn't become a problem if it's just newspapers or if it's just the left wing or if it's just the right wing.  But when every when you get these unholy coalitions between all these groups, if I were Google or Facebook or Amazon, I'd be threatened.  They should have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I want to go back to something we said last week because it was on the show last week that the story of the one hundred thousand dollar Russian political ads on Facebook broke.  Right.  And we were talking about it.  My first thought was, well, no matter what my first thought was, I was wrong.  Whatever it was.  But I in first blush, I wondered whether Facebook could have known they were Russian.  And that's key.  If there were ads, there were ads.  There's another talk about saying that Facebook should be under the same regulations, Stacy, as television and should be transparent about this.  This to me becomes pretty easy now.  And Facebook's not doing this.  Facebook should disclose the ads and the targeting that was used for them.  It should expose how the manipulation occurs.  The public deserves to know this.  Well, wait, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what so so tied to that, though, we have a story about that.  This is not the sponsored tag, the controversial tag, not actually helping on Facebook.  And I'm wondering if what you're proposing would have the same lack of effectiveness.  Well, I think it's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Let me answer that first.  It's not it's the disputed tag, which is the fact checking thing.  And here's here again.  I'm going to criticize Facebook.  That was a study, one study with interviews outside of Facebook saying that the fact checker dispute only affects a certain amount of of attitude towards something that's disputed.  And if it's ideological, one way or the other, it could actually make it make it make the spring of it worse.  The problem here, too, is that Facebook is not being transparent about this.  And journalists are asking Facebook because journalists are helping with the fact checking.  Would you please give us the data on this?  That's complicated to this extent.  When the disputed tag comes up on Facebook, Facebook itself reacts to that.  Right. They I think that they don't promote stuff that's disputed now because they don't want to be accused of pushing what is seen clearly as fake.  So you can't separate the user behavior, the impact on the user behavior from the impact on Facebook's algorithm.  Nonetheless, in both these cases, facial should be open.  So the difference between that, Stacy, and the political ads is that's not about trying to expose the political ad to the user.  It's about exposing this set of political ads and their targeting criteria to researchers and media so we can understand what did the Russkies do and how did they do it?  Who do they go after with what and what impact that they had?  So that's more for researchers than it is for the end user.  But both cases are about being transparent.  And you're right, Leo, if this kind of stuff is going to go around, it would only be wise of them to say, let's go overhead over heels to be transparent, to be open, to get the help of researchers to figure out what's going on here and do something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, how does this tie into the bodega?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the bodega story is about, by the way, our friend Siva Varianathan has the great hashtag on this one, the brodega.  That's exactly what it is.  It's about Silicon Valley adage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to explain the story first?  Yeah, so a couple of former Googlers have created a very interesting product.  It's a locked box, display box that goes in your apartment or, you know, other public place, maybe your business.  You unlock it with your phone and take what you want.  Stacey would have this at her home, but no one else would.  There's no human here.  It's just like that Amazon store that knows who you are and knows with cameras and sensors what you've purchased and charges your phone automatically.  And you walk away and the thing locks itself back up.  It is a corner store without any employees.  And this is a startup and they call it bodega because it will replace all the little bodegas in New York City.  I don't know if it will or won't, but it's certainly not going to have the range of products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so this set off a firestorm of people saying of brodega jokes.  There's a Josh Marsh tweet.  I actually appreciate the douchebags who rolled out the let's end bodegas idea.  The burgeoning tech backlash needed this moment of douchebaggery.  Well, wait a minute though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should an entrepreneur worry about that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so because it shows the haughtiness, the separation from reality of real life of Silicon Valley employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What if it's a better way to serve people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And be sensitive about how you do it.  Find a way that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should Uber not attempt to replace cab drivers because of the poor cab drivers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should figure out what the impact is and have some kind of...  I disagree entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to disagree with you there.  Do I think these guys were tone deaf in naming their company bodega?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They probably shouldn't have named it bodega.  They could have just called it the stuff box or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could have called it Vending 2.0 and nobody would have complained.  Yeah, it's just a vending machine.  A vending machine.  So then they wrote a post trying to walk back as fast as they could.  But all it does is it showed the attitude in Silicon Valley and it showed the cluelessness as to the current atmosphere which Ben Smith wrote about.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, they maybe even took it a step further because I guess there's a meme called bodega cats about cats that sleep in bodegas.  And they took the bodega cat as their logo, which probably added insult to injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, hold on, guys, because I think there's some blame to be had here, too.  The media flipped out on this one.  And the Fast Company article is the one.  Didn't the Fast Company article actually suggest that this was going to, in the headline, replace bodegas?  Yeah, it says it will make them obsolete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not necessarily what these guys were planning, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's talk about that.  One, a lot of this outrage was from this headline, which totally find these guys in their walk back.  Do I again?  They're like, oh, we talked to some people in New York and we had branding firms.  And I'm like, yeah, but did you talk to the right people?  Probably not.  And I get it.  And totally tone deaf.  But this is like a tempest in a freaking teapot.  You guys, this startup may not even be around in six months.  It's not that freaking innovative.  Let's let's joust at something real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Stacey, I like your point about media.  And I just put up something on the rundown at the bottom of the of the other.  Which I think demonstrates your point excellently how fake news is created.  Parker Malloy put up a Twitter thread that Jennifer Lawrence allegedly said that hurricanes are punishment for electing Trump.  And this spreads around.  You see the first The Daily Wire.  You see it on Alex Jones.  You see it everywhere.  You see CNN write about it.  You go to the next tweet, you know, she didn't say that at all.  Not at all.  But it takes on a life of its own.  Media get used.  They go for the clicks.  They're the chumps.  The bad guys put this into the agenda.  And now poor Jennifer Lawrence is acting like there is a war over this when there's not.  It does not pay to be in the public eye anymore.  Geez, Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just just if anybody is considering at this point being famous, don't.  Just don't.  It's not all that it's cracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not going to get better either.  And what what people remember is still a lot of times the fake news.  I mean, look at look at everybody and out poor Al Gore and inventing the Internet.  I mean, so this is it's not new.  It spreads faster.  You can do it easier.  You can make up just about anything.  And the bodega guys have apologized.  Yeah, I still again, they're idiots.  But God, y'all, let's just know that they're idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that sounds like a pretty good idea.  It's not that new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook has had this in the vending machine.  I'm like, I feel like in Japan, you could probably walk up to.  I'm sure there's some supply chain management and optimization and they can grab like Zareli  ESC algorithms.  Who went throwing eggs at the Google bus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People in gentrified neighbors and neighbors in San Francisco where bodegas were going away, getting replaced by Starbucks.  It doesn't take a genius to say, hmm, we're going to have a public relationship here.  What should that relationship look like?  What should we be sensitive to in an age when jobs are going to be eliminated, when we know most retail jobs are going to be eliminated?  We're going to come out with this.  What should we how should we position this?  What should we call it?  Let's call it little Spanish guy down at the corner who's going to be jobless and poor soon and deported by the president.  And we don't care because we're Googlers.  That's it's just dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it really all it was is just a total lack of awareness of the outside world.  And everybody's mad at Silicon Valley for that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's my only point.  That is my only point.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just it's the media.  It's so interesting.  I need a vacation.  The landscape, the media landscape is so broken and people are I mean, this is none of this makes any sense or anything.  It's just in Jennifer Lawrence and Bodega's is a very similar thread here.  It's just a bunch of it's I blame Twitter, but it's not just Twitter.  Although Twitter is definitely helping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is this is this is my point about the Franklin four piece.  Did you see that one?  No, what's that?  Franklin four wrote it were an absolute screed against technology.  And it was excerpted in the Washington Post.  And then I did as we used to call it a fisking in blog days.  It's on the run now where it's just it was amazing because it's a technology is going to take away our individuality.  And I thought how unselfish where can you be?  Mass media never gave us individuality.  It never never got us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's got a book called World Without Mind.  That kind of crap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it let us ignore like it let us create our own individuality without being having things shoved in our face.  I just want to say we did it to ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We did it to ourselves.  This is not there's no blame here.  This is the environment we've created.  We did it.  That's a Radiohead song.  Oh, well, yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  Radiohead.  You would know what else.  I can't sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  It's easy to blame Twitter or Google or try Reddit or 4chan.  But really, this is this is the world we've all created.  I mean, I blame 24 hour the 24 hour news channel.  Absolutely.  I blame Sean Hannity.  I blame the business model of mass media.  Irma.  I blame.  It's all.  It just makes me want to move to the wilderness with her and.  And Leo, Leo, you would not last 20 seconds in the wilderness.  But I have a note eight.  I could probably figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm going to give you the note eight.  It's too big.  You cannot carry it in your pocket like that.  It disrupts the line of your suit.  It pops up like an ugly handkerchief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if I put it what if I put it here?  It's just because I'm lazy.  See, now it's in my breast pocket.  I have your jacket.  It's going to be.  And it's.  Well, I was going to hang it around my neck.  How about that with a little pendant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, who was it?  One of the anchors down in Florida,  did they put a baggie in the phone in a baggie?  I think it was I think was Leonard Holt, Leonard, Leonard Holt, Lester Holt.  Holt.  I think he had his phone in a baggie,  which was better than the MSNBC reporter who tied himself to a building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw that picture you tweeted so that he wouldn't get washed away in Irma.  Every time I saw somebody doing a stand up in the storm, I thought of you, Jeff,  every single time screaming.  But, you know, I think the ratings if he got washed away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but but I think the business model, it all goes back to the business model.  Exactly.  Stacy Anderson Cooper explained it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anderson Cooper standing there is soggy.  He's wet.  He explained it.  He said, we go out here so you can see what it's like.  So you don't have to go out here and risk your necks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The trees will tell the story.  It's windy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's fair, but it's better for a person standing there almost and he's tethered and he's almost dead.  It's crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Self justification for ratings.  Although I will say, I watched some of those.  Jennifer Wallborn, Brodegas and.  It's all ratings.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have created a perfect feedback loop where we tell them what we want and they give us what we want.  And then we want more of it.  And they give us.  We are rats in a Skinner box hitting the pellet button over and over again.  We did it to ourselves.  They did it to us.  It's this feedback loop.  This is it.  That's all there is.  We don't know Edward Armour to say, well, we need a division where we don't make any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Edward Arboro, by the way, was the first guy to go stand in the seriously was the first guy to go stand is London.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, he has to be also in a hurricane in a hurricane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because well, I mean, here's the here's the challenge, right?  We can talk about business all models all we want and blame the business guys.  But at the same time as a journalist, I do want someone to read my story.  If I if I'm actually going out and reporting on something really important, I may feel cheap to get like I call I call them dead babies.  But because dead babies sell newspapers and get people to read these stories that are otherwise really difficult and boring.  But you have to go out and find those as much as it may be awful, because otherwise people aren't going to read it and they're not going to know the information they need.  Health care is a really good example of this storms warning and trying to convey.  Nobody's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody cares.  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are people who do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, but they're getting to be fewer and fewer because the people who are most successful are the ones who don't worry about putting any nutrition in your Wheaties.  They just say put more sugar in the Wheaties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we just have more crap to wade through.  I mean, there's always been a finite supply of really good investigative journalism.  I mean, it's not like.  That is that is very much a calling.  That is very much so.  And so in that still exists, we're just it's so much easier to throw crap at things now.  So we're doing that, too.  And it just buries the good stuff.  I really I really do think that there's still plenty of really good reporting out there.  I just think it's buried in other.  Yeah, what do we reward?  We don't reward the really good.  Sorry, we don't reward the really good reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We reward the the cats in the and the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People do reward good reporting.  People say that, yes, you just you're not going to get rewarded.  I feel like I'm doing good reporting and I'm making money.  I'm not going to make it's a lifestyle for me.  It is not going to make me rich, but I'm doing what I love and I'm explaining it.  And there's an audience of people who if I read this paper on foldable electronics  and explain to them in plain English what this means and how it might change the world,  they'll listen to it.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's all that.  It was always about that.  It was trying to give people real information to be of value to them, not trying to be the  most successful enterprise out there.  That's why we never took venture capital, because I didn't want anybody to tell me that  we had to have more cleavage on the show or whatever.  But that's not it's no way to rich riches.  And we don't.  And as a result, Stacey, you probably would acknowledge we don't reach the largest possible  audience by any means.  That's true.  But you reach a higher value audience.  Well, that's the hope.  Yeah, it's high.  It's somewhat higher value.  But frankly, Goodyear is never going to advertise on Twitter.  I mean, you know, the big bucks are still going to NFL.  And I don't know.  Maybe I'm just being a depressive, cranky old man.  But I think we are in it.  And it's our biologies, by the way, that are determining this.  I mean, it's clearly what our brains were designed to, you know, collect gossip.  No, I don't think so.  Oh, come on. It is evolutionary biology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have we have parts that we all have those parts of us.  Right. I mean, I look at cat videos.  Ted Cruz looks at porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what's that story, by the way?  Did he what happened there?  Because I keep seeing I keep seeing people refer to it.  We liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, staff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he said Ted Cruz's official Twitter account liked a porn tweet.  Right. I didn't know there was porn on Twitter.  Oh, my God. There's so much porn on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not know this was a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I felt like I felt there's a character in the video while still dressed.  It's supposed to be somebody's stupid somebody and she's related to somebody and she's watching.  So the one who's not stupid at the moment is has this great shocked look thing.  And that's turning into the greatest gift.  So but and so Cruz's excuse was, oh, it wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was my staffer.  Yes. I'm poor staffers from the porn bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really easy to by accident like a tweet, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can I do it all the time.  You know, you accidentally because I'm lefty.  But you have to see it first.  Oh, that's a good point. You have to be following it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you could search for, you know, incest videos and get that by accident.  Why would you be searching incest videos?  Why would you be searching incest videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it happens.  Look, look, Leo, there's me who literally had no idea there was porn on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a whole mother of other Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's there's so many Twitter's.  That's one of the most interesting things.  My favorite Twitter's black Twitter is fabulous.  It's fabulous.  It's the best Twitter of all.  But I think that is one of the most interesting things about Twitter, isn't it?  The subculture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you want some good news, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you better, because I'm getting depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google backs the Oxford comma.  I call that great news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who doesn't?  Oh, I'm so mad.  Who doesn't back the Oxford comma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, you don't?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I'm shocked.  I feel that any writer is you can tell when you need an Oxford comma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know people are always giving the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  You could tell when you need it.  You could tell when it is shoots and leaves would be confusing.  Oh, you use it consistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the point of grammar.  So that you know the meaning.  No, I think no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey's a more modern.  I understand what you're saying, Stacey.  You're saying you don't have to follow the rules.  You have to be clear.  You have to be unambiguous.  You have to.  Right.  That's all.  That's your only obligation.  Stacey's ruining the language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what she's doing.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Single-handedly.  I literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oxford comma.  I would just point out, Stacey, that it is easier to always use it than to try to look  at every sentence and say, would this be confusing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so my editors will tell you that my comma abilities are terrible.  I think one of them was like, I like how you go in after you've written something and clearly  just sprinkle commas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a Latin teacher call that comma blunder.  You're a comma blunderer.  I am.  I sprinkle my commas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, you know, that feels like a natural place to take a breath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is actually a really interesting art to know when to and when not to use commas.  And I would say in general, use fewer, not more commas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My weakness is I use too many semicolons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Oxford comma, for people who are baffled and would like to be enlightened on the most  important grammatical rule of all is when you have three or more things in a series  like each, let's see, one, two and three.  Let's make it easy.  You put a comma after each item in the series, including the one before the end.  One comma, two comma and three.  If you don't, it could look like one comma, two and three.  It could look like two items in the series instead of three.  That's usually obvious that it's one, two and three, not one, two and three.  And but what Stacey's saying is when it isn't clear, you should put a comma in.  What Jeff's saying is you should always put a comma in to avoid ambiguity.  Not recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I dedicate this book to my book to my parents, comma and random God, as opposed to I dedicate this book to my parents, comma and random comma and God.  And where did Google weigh in on this?  And the is in the register there.  They basically have a developer documentation guide.  Now there's something here relevant to Stacey.  So Internet is now lowercase as it should be because it is just part of society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always use the lowercase until Microsoft Word kept telling me it's uppercase.  I make a lowercase in all cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  However, Internet of Things, the I and T are uppercase so that you can get the abbreviation IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who gets who uses Google for their English style guides?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the AP style guide did they lower it?  Didn't AP lowercase Internet many, many moons ago?  I mean, maybe also did not.  Guardian was early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guardian did it earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then there's email, one word email with a dash between the E and the M.  There's a lot of these things.  Who invented it?  And then there's who invented it.  Yes, I invented email in high school.  Many people don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I didn't know that the word jank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As in janky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As in blocking a software application's user interface due to slow operations or poor interface design.  Google says it should be used with care.  Why?  They say don't use learnings.  No, you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because a lot of developers will use this kind of slangy descriptions instead of something more precise.  That's all.  Login is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sign in is the preferred verb.  Login is not a verb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And whatever you do, don't use the word learnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, do not use Google as a verb.  You cannot use Google something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can search with Google, but you may not Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about how about do not capitalize?  No, not.  Nevermind.  I was going to say how do we pronounce cash?  It's cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, is this for written or spoken word?  This is written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the developer documentation guide here.  OK.  Now, the other one I like is interface.  Similarly is not a verb.  That's right.  Damn straight.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Partner is not a verb.  Talk, speak, communicate.  Partner is a noun, not a verb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All these people verbalizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this probably wouldn't happen except this guide from Google, except they probably see so many god awful.  Oh, you can imagine.  It must be horrible looking at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, this is the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide.  It has goals and non-goals.  If you go forward to it.  It doesn't apply to all Google documentation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess you can use the not Oxford, the Stacy comment, as I'll call it in the future elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, this is an example of an article.  No normal person cares about in the least.  We're talking about it as my.  But it's written by a journalist whose stock in trade is whether to put a comma after the second item, a serial or not.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want to see our Slack channel, if the Oxford comma was mentioned anywhere.  Yes.  Only journalists, actually, journalists and people who care about grammar.  I don't.  I mean, I've had arguments with non-journalists about this.  I'm a bit of a grammar.  Grammar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is fun for developers.  So I go to the anthropomorphism link on the developer documentation style guide.  Not recommended.  Recommended.  The PC sees a new device.  Recommended.  The PC detects a new device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, screw that.  It's I think you could say sees.  I don't have a problem with that.  That's interesting that they take the source to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of fun.  Did you put a link in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see this to the Google open source blog, making the Google developers documentation style guide public.  You can now use it for open source documentation projects.  It's developers dash.  I'm sorry.  Developers.google.com slash style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I still would stick with the AP style guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm actually okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they even quote George Orwell saying, break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Barbarous.  Here's one.  There's a word list.  Abort.  Don't use.  Instead, use words like stop, exit, cancel, or end.  That's political.  That's not.  Access as a verb.  Avoid when you can.  In favor of friendlier words like see, edit, find, use, or view.  I couldn't agree more with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but access has a particular meaning in computer talk.  I don't care.  It's not English.  Technical writing is a little bit different than writing prose, you know, standard prose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what academics say too, and they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true that disciplines often become jargonized.  And that's not a good thing because it kind of limits their audience.  So I'll agree with you on that.  But frankly, if it's not in strunken white, I is chew it.  Now, why would it say don't use application?  Is that how you say it?  It's chew.  It's chew.  That's how I say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always thought it was a shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you say it, Carson?  You went to Harvard.  Well, you're both wrong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's as chew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just look it up in the dictionary.  OK.  No, I got it right here.  Look, he just doesn't want to show it.  That's pronounced the shoe shoe.  Yes.  She's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look it.  Look it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look it.  As you hear, play my audio.  It's true.  It's true.  It's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, Google, how do you pronounce as shoe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't ask her that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now make it pronounced cuneiform.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  So we had this debate.  So I'm listening to this book.  Now, what do you think, Carson, on the cuneiform?  It's cuneiform.  Is it really?  Because I've always said cuneiform.  There isn't an E in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it comes from the Latin word cuneus, meaning wedge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And look, in this dictionary, cuneiform, three syllables.  Cuneiform.  Show off.  Cuneiform, three syllables.  Cuneiform.  All three are acceptable.  Cuneiform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cuneiform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  However, this comes up because I'm listening to a book where the guy for a whole chapter  says cuneiform, and it's driving me nuts.  But it's a Britishism.  I think cuneiform is preferred in Britain.  Like aluminium?  It's certainly acceptable.  But it does come from the Latin cuneus, which via the French cuneiform.  But I'm just saying.  This is interesting.  So Google goes for the singular they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's very interesting, given the recent history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that pronouns thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  See, again, this is political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My pronouns are they, them, and theirs.  People like to view that as political, but that's also just how people talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you can't stand that, says Google, then use he or she or rewrite to avoid singular  gendered pronouns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is English going to evolve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's an evolving language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't.  Let's not be like the French.  Is it going to evolve to use them in place of he or she?  It's that great character in Billions.  Yeah, my pronouns are they, them, and their.  But when we went to Google I.O., you were with me, weren't you?  They had a sign at the registration.  We care about your pronouns and stickers that you could put on your badge, whether you prefer  to be a he or she or they.  So I think that's fine.  I think it is unfortunate that the collective human noun is he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got in trouble with one of my former students because I used in my last book, I  used the presumptive pronoun, I used female in all cases.  And I had an example of a user doing that.  I would then say she.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of like that because I think it shakes you up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember exactly why I was in trouble, which is worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's like a good fashion.  You don't want to do something that draws the eye.  And using she draws the eye, right?  Wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrong.  Using she only draws the eye because we have lived forever.  Okay, I grant you that.  With the assumption that anything worth doing is male.  And it's her story, not his story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I grant you that.  So.  But it does draw the eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't draw the eye.  The point is, like I use she all the time in my stuff and it no longer draws the eye.  Unless you're an old misogynistic person who doesn't want to look at the world from that  perspective.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I take that personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel very strongly about this.  I think people who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm with you.  I'm like.  And it's more than just a choice of words.  It really does precondition the mind to think that all men are doctors.  All doctors are men and all nurses are women and all of that.  And so I think it is important.  But we have yet to come up with a felicitous solution because I think they is also.  It's ugly to me.  They is what people use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll get used to it.  I rewrite sentences where possible where the plural fits.  Or a good way around it.  Right.  Yeah.  That's a good way around.  I use he or she.  But I also will.  If it's a case of I'm presuming a person.  So I'm not using it as a non-specific.  I have a person.  I presume that person is a woman.  It lasts.  One exception.  One exception.  Important exception.  When discussing trolls.  They're always he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are he.  Or just trolls.  Or trolls.  Right.  No pronouns.  They don't deserve a pronoun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's another funny one.  Smart phone.  Do not use.  Instead use mobile phone or phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Eurocentric and it bothers me.  It's also Apple.  Because we call them cell phones in the states and they call them mobiles everywhere else.  Or Handys in Germany.  It's my favorite.  Or Handys.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I like this show.  Because we drift very afar.  As soon as the audience drifted away.  They've drifted asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're engaged.  One more.  Voila.  Don't use.  Don't use voila.  Don't use voila.  It's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they say anything about y'all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My phone probably.  My application is probably if they say y'all.  I'd be like don't even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait till young Sheldon takes off.  Everybody gonna be talking like this.  It's gonna be.  You know he doesn't have an accent.  Isn't that interesting?  They all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because southern accents are considered idiotic.  Yup.  They're hicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I noticed that too.  I noticed that too Stacey.  I was wondering if you saw it because I didn't want to bring it up because I didn't want  to see your feelings be hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a southern accent.  I say y'all.  Y'all.  Unless I'm talking to someone with a southern accent.  How about ain't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I say it actually a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  Only for first person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ain't is actually a venerable construction was used by Shakespeare.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still don't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's material design awards are out.  We'll talk about that in just a moment.  I only say that to remind you what the subject matter of the show is.  And that we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was an exciting tease.  I can't wait for that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  I can do better.  Grammar.  I was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Today.  I can do better.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's vacation people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about Blueborn or something.  Blueborn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And why everybody uses Android should quickly.  Freak out.  Freak out.  Our show today brought to you by my doorbell.  I do not have to freak out when I hear my doorbell ring.  I know.  The ring video doorbell replaces your regular doorbell.  Pairs to your internet.  Has a camera.  HD camera on it.  Microphone.  Speaker.  And motion sensors.  When anybody walks by your door and you get to set the area that it's looking at.  It lets you know on your phone.  Wherever you are.  When somebody rings your doorbell.  You hear a dong, dong, dong on your phone.  And you can answer it.  You could say I'm in the bath.  Please go away or whatever.  Do not burglar my house today.  I am here.  I am armed.  And I am ready to shoot you.  And that will work.  Because bad guys don't want confrontations.  They just go on to the other house.  The house without the ring video doorbell.  Now Ring has expanded their line.  They've got new doorbells and the new floodlight cam.  It's a motion activated camera and floodlight.  Same thing.  Got a camera, speaker, microphone, motion sensors.  There's a few extra little things there.  These floodlights go on when they detect motion.  You could speak to the intruder in your yard.  Whether it be a raccoon or a burglar.  And if it doesn't scare them off when you say,  Hey, what are you doing there?  You can press a button and a 110 decibel alarm will flood their eardrums.  And they will tear off into the night.  I love it.  The Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.  The Ring video doorbell.  The Ring floodlight cams.  The Ring stick up cam.  Go to right now ring.com slash twig.  You can save up to $150 off a Ring of Security kit.  And if you already have a Ring and I know most of you do,  get one for family members, for friends, for parents.  Help them protect themselves.  Ring.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a massive booth at Cedia.  I bet they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're big.  What's great is they're taking the money and they're creating new products,  which I love.  Jamie's really a smart guy, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like their alarm system?  Oh, I didn't hear about that.  Oh yeah, they're going to have an alarm system.  He actually, he advertised on my show for Cedia and he talked about it,  but there's a lawsuit with ADT.  They bought Zonoff a while back.  And the reason why is because they're building an alarm system.  Oh, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How can ADT sue them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, oh God, it's so messy.  You just don't even want to go there.  So ADT, they're suing them because they hired everyone from a company that ADT  invested in and they're alleging, I don't remember all the allegations.  Stealing stuff.  Let's put it under the stealing stuff category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stealing innovation.  So Cedia is the International Trade Association for,  well it used to be home theater installers,  but it's expanded now to a lot more.  It was a lot of IOT stuff.  I guess that's why you went, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is why I went.  Well, I know you like home theater installers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, yes, they're lovely people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  However, you probably went for things like, you know,  Jamie Semenoff and people like that were there.  So what did you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything interesting?  You know, a couple of things that are worth noting.  First off, guys, I saw these gorgeous back mounted OLED screens encased in glass.  This is from LG.  I think I put a picture, I think it's the picture actually under my podcast.  Did that publish yet?  Yes, it did.  The Cedia podcast that's up on my site.  So you can see a picture of it because it's freaking gorgeous.  But it's $20,000.  So we're not going to get that anytime soon.  How big is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Four.  I don't remember.  She's gesturing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very big.  It's large.  That was Stacey's very big sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can see there's a guy kind of in the background.  He's probably about three feet away.  So seven feet tall or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it's not seven feet tall.  It's 18 feet tall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about, well, let's see.  He's probably five.  It's probably five feet tall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because it's off the floor, I feel like when I looked at it, my eyes were a little like  at her nose level.  What makes that so special?  Because it's gorgeous.  Look how it's embedded in that glass.  It's back to back.  It's just a wonderful way of framing a television.  So this is for high end and it's moving.  It's for display.  It's for display.  High end retail display.  But imagine that in landscape.  I'd hang that on my wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's some gorgeous TVs out there.  I have an LG 4K TV.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there were lots of really cool other things that I saw.  A lot of energy management systems.  That's really getting hot, which is kind of exciting.  Things that let you plug your generator.  Plug your generator.  Is that the word I meant?  Sorry.  You plug things into your breaker panel and then connect it to a battery.  And then you can actually allocate during a power outage.  Oh.  It gets to suck juice.  And you do it from an app as opposed to having to hardware things.  I need that because I want to get a power wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you had a power wall.  Actually, you can do that with your Tesla because a Tesla is a power wall on wheels.  Right.  And you can use an inverter to use the Tesla to power your house should the power be out.  I just need whatever that doohickey is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so you don't power the entire house, Stacy.  Are you saying that you need smart plugs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no.  If it's tied into your breaker system, your breaker will just turn things off.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our breaker system is, I mean, good God.  The weird things that are connected to each other in this house.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and again, this is why this was at a professional installer show.  This is not something I recommend you install yourself on your breaker system.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, breaking news.  Martin Shkreli going to jail after his Facebook post about Hillary Clinton.  A federal judge revoked his $5 million bail.  He's the former hedge fund manager convicted of defrauding investors.  He was the pharma guy who raised the price on the pill to a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's trying to sell the Wuntang Clan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, he has a, he bought, he bought an exclusive one cop, one time only copy of the new Wuntang Clan album.  And now he's selling it on eBay saying I kind of really didn't listen to it that much.  I need the money.  He while waiting sentences, Shkreli has, am I saying his name right?  Shkreli.  That's the worst name.  Shkreli.  That's why he's like this.  As harassed women online, prosecutors argued even offered his Facebook followers $5,000 to grab a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair during her arrest.  Hillary Clinton's hair during her book tour.  He faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it grab a strand or yank her by the hair?  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's good.  He is, his bond has been revoked.  And the district judge, Kiyo Matsumoto said he does not need to apologize to me.  He should have apologized to the government, the Secret Service and Hillary Clinton.  This is a solicitation of assault that is not protected by the First Amendment.  He was taken into custody immediately after the hour long hearing.  He will remain jailed until his sensing hearing later this fall.  So he was out on bail, but that bail has been revoked.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't feel bad about that at all.  He is really a douche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a well, I was thinking of a word beginning with the you're not quite that, but I'm not sure if I, Carson, can I say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've said it already.  It's French for shower.  It's OK.  I'm going to France.  I need to bone up on my French.  Où est le douche?  Pardon Monsieur, Où est le douche?  Prendre douche.  Prendre douche.  Shrelle's attorney says in this current political climate, dissent has unfortunately often taken the form of political satire, hyperbole, parody or sarcasm.  While we do not condone his comments, his constitutionally protected political hyperbole does not, that's what I do.  Constitutionally protected political hyperbole does not rise to the level of making him a danger to the community.  Yes, but inciting violence makes others a danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and think about what happened with, you know, Gabby Giffords getting shot and think about Republicans.  Even that crazy Democrat guy who went and ran out and shot Republicans or actually congressmen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when you know who said, I hope the Second Amendment people take care of her.  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  By the way, pro tip.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying you got, what happened?  You got an audible, she reads it, which I love.  Yeah.  And she got to go to 1.5 speed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have her talk very slowly.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just thinking of what's his name on HBO.  Bill Maher's comment that anybody who hates Hillary Clinton must have been molested by a real estate salesperson saleswoman when he was young.  I don't know.  I just made me laugh.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Let's not do the material design stuff.  Let's just not do that.  It's actually it's actually really boring.  In fact, I can't think of anything more boring than these material design award winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to do a damn transition here.  Tease.  I'm tired.  I can't wait to get off.  I will do a terrible tease.  What the heck?  That was the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it actually is it actually materials design like new chemicals or?  No, no, no.  I was curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Material design is Google's name for the design style of Android.  And it killed me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see?  Did you see?  This is only funny because it's a hilarious journalism story, probably.  But Fortune got a story about Google expanding its offices because they basically their real estate developer emailed or someone in the company emailed a fortune reporter as part of an email thread on Google buying these new office buildings.  So one, Google's expanding and like buying two hundred and seventy five million dollars worth of real estate.  And two, the news came out because someone accidentally put a fortune editor in the email chain.  I thought that was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, probably a good idea if you want to keep something secret not to put a journalist in the CC.  Yeah, but it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happens more often than not necessarily on something that big.  But I get a lot of emails that are not for me that are really not for me.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you ever report on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've only had one that was worth reporting on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most of them are just with the ethics of that be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like it's pretty it's a mistake.  But sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess, you know, it's like if you stumbled on a phone in a bar and you thought it was newsworthy, you could report on that.  That's not it's just it was an accidental discovery.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you're there's been plenty of times when I've been at conferences that are not off the record, they're just technical and they just don't they assume journalists won't be there.  So they say more things.  And then when I write them, yeah, the people are like, well, that was a conference, you know, there were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, it was in public there.  It was a confidential information.  They knew I was there.  Now, I feel like it's some publications I've worked at when you were doing any sort of like, I don't even want to call it a journal.  Announce yourself.  You had to announce that you were a journalist, which sometimes like in like Equifax is a good example.  If I call them and say I'm a journalist trying to understand what consumers are going through right now, I might get a vastly different experience.  So like there are some cases where I'm like, I hate that rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I don't think it's a rule because because any user can now call Equifax and say what's going on and then post on it and you can quote it.  Everybody can do journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I, I like to think that because of who I am in my history that people that I've enacted in public as a journalist, I have more credibility than Joe Schmo online when reporting about a user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The writer, not everything, Stacey, about everything except the punctuation.  I mean, anybody can say this happened to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, be wise to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you have an Android phone in your possession, you might want to check.  Blueborn.  To see if you have the September security update.  I checked my pixel this morning.  It was still on August.  Now, this is going to be a waste of time, but let me just check the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.  I bet you I'd be surprised if it has June's update.  Let's see here.  Software update download updates manually.  Let's see if there's any update for mice.  Anybody who has a pixel.  Have you been updated?  The fix is for a blue.  When?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Soon.  Like since this morning.  When was this this morning?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Recently.  About five.  Terrible, horrible thing.  Get ready for this one.  This is a good one.  Five point three billion devices are vulnerable.  Two billion of them are Android tablets, wearables, as well as phones.  It's something called Blueborn.  It was discovered yesterday by a security firm, Armis Labs.  It takes advantage of the fact that most devices broadcast over Bluetooth broadcast their availability.  And so if the Bluetooth connection on your device is active, you're vulnerable to this.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to pay.  It's an over the air attack.  It's an over the air attack.  You just have to be within Bluetooth range, which is about 30 meters.  The bad guy can use this attack to get full access to your phone.  They actually demoed it on a Google Pixel showing the phone being remotely accessed.  Apps like the camera and the file system can be accessed completely undetected by the user.  In effect, you are fully pwned.  Android devices that are vulnerable, the Pixel, the Galaxy, Galaxy Tab, LG Watch Sport and the pumpkin car audio system, which I am not familiar with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are actually just examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're examples because we're talking two billion Android devices, which is most of them.  Google has pushed out of September security patch that takes care of it.  But unfortunately, a lot of people won't get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in their their only patching is it Marshmallow and Nougat?  Yes, six and seven.  I was going to say, are we really going with Nougat?  Not me.  I'm in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oreo doesn't need it.  No, that's a good question.  Does Oreo need it?  I don't know.  I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, so in Oreo, used to be you had that nice little thing you go to and say, am I up to date or not?  Because we do that obsessively.  I can't find it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's there.  Where?  It's just in a different part.  Here's a demo of Blueborn.  Well, we should just enjoy the.  Here's on the left, the hacker screen.  On the right, the device screen.  The hacker, Wiley Hacker, is launching his Python 7 script.  His Pony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really feel bad for hackers trying to make this interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pony done within 30 seconds.  One attempt, one success.  Doing stack memory leaks.  So once you get in, you have to take advantage of a memory leak.  Devices that don't use ASLR are particularly vulnerable.  But even though the pixel uses ASLR, it's vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could also implement a man in the middle attack too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice. So here we go.  They're going to see if they can get this attack going.  They believe they'd hacked the device.  And I guess apparently they have because they're waking up the phone.  Yep.  Phone got awakened.  Replaying recorded mouse movement.  I was going to say the phone got woke.  Opening the camera app.  Switching to the front camera.  Taking advantage of that very lovely person.  They took a photo.  Now can they, yep, there's all the images in the storage.  They're going to take it.  And there's the image they want.  And they're going to cat that out to themselves.  To their IP address.  And now they have that image.  So within a minute.  One minute and 32 seconds they were able to take over this young woman's phone.  Snap a picture of her.  I want to presume the woman had the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The woman could be evil and actually she could be the hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know who the hacker was. Could have been her as well.  But that was the victim.  They took over her phone without her knowledge.  Snapped a picture of her and sent it to themselves.  All without her knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a blue-born vulnerability scanner by Armis in the app store.  Not the app store. The Google Play store.  And you can download it.  You can both find out if your device is vulnerable.  But you can also wander around and be like, hey you. You at the bar.  Look here. Your device is vulnerable.  You can make lots of friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What am I supposed to do about that?  Oh there's nothing you can do. I just want to let you know.  Or you could actually use it and then be like, oh this is the perfect place to launch my attack from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My blue-born attack.  Either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is why these monthly security updates are so important.  And unfortunately very few phones support them.  I am encouraged by Oreo and the new treble architecture that this will.  Google is doing everything I think it can to get everybody.  Even on the cheap Android devices that aren't usually updated.  Get everybody into an updated situation so that they can protect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we talked about this. So we talk about this on our show tomorrow.  But the Samsung was actually really distressing to me.  Because Tizen. This also affects Linux.  So it's not just iOS.  It's not just Android. It's anything with Bluetooth.  It is a lot of things. Windows.  But Linux. And so Samsung's Tizen OS.  Which is on their televisions, their fridges and other fun products.  They actually never responded to Armis when Armis sent this out.  And Armis apparently contacted Google and Apple in April.  So they reached out to Samsung three times. Samsung never responded.  So if you have a Samsung device that has Bluetooth running.  I mean your smart TV. You may not actually even need it to have Bluetooth constantly broadcasting.  I mean you'd have to invite the hacker into your home for that to be taken advantage of.  But I guess you could if you owned a smart TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only mitigating factor is you have to be within Bluetooth range.  But if you're in a coffee shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bluetooth range all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're at a coffee shop or a train station or somewhere like that.  I mean you're vulnerable. It's not a good thing.  Let's just say it that way.  Let's take a break and talk about Equifax.  We're almost done here.  Stacy Higginbotham.  I am almost done here.  Like wow.  I am so cooked. Stacy Higginbotham.  She's here. She's from Stacy on IOT.  And the IOT podcast which you can find at IOTpodcast.com.  Also Jeff Jarvis from CUNY.  It's nice to have the gang back together again.  So glad you are both here.  Then you desert us.  I'm going to leave. Jason Howell will do the show next week right?  And then the following week is it Jason again or who's?  Yeah so Jason will be taking care of you.  I'm even coming up for twit Sunday and you won't be there.  You're coming to town into the studio?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait. You ready Leo? While you're gone.  I was even going to come into the studio.  You guys do this on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know you do. You say is Leo there?  Okay I'll wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten let me know when he's going on vacation.  So next week, next twit Jason Calacanis is hosting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to be on that one Jeff?  Yeah I didn't know that when I said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh Jason's great.  You're going to have a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason is a pistol.  No no he's fun.  Yeah.  Cocked and loaded.  I'm going to watch him. That's fine.  Get into it with him. That's great.  You know Jason and I have had our ups and downs.  But I find him great. He's very entertaining.  And I actually genuinely like the guy.  Good and when are you going to be here Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not now.  Because I'm going to be in San Francisco.  I'm not going to make the Petaluma quest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know people don't know this but  Jeff and I have had intimate relations.  I've shaved him.  But I've never met Stacey in person at all.  And I don't think that's an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never?  No. Never.  Jeff and I, I think I met you Jeff once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yes no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't remember being once Stacey.  Problem is we ordered too many conferences.  You can't put somebody in a context.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't remember meeting Stacey?  Stacey doesn't remember meeting me.  Oh you remember meeting her but she doesn't remember.  Well no I think I met Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we met at South By.  But South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you remember South By you weren't there.  I think that's how the saying goes.  Our show today brought to you by Legal Zoom.  You know we live in a world of lawyers.

I only have the note with me today.  I didn't bring the Pixel. I wish I had.  Search for system.  Or  security patch level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's also Yale.  If you say anything about the  tables down at Mori's, that's three strikes. You'll be  out.  Let's talk about... One percent. One percent.  One percent. Ra, ra, ra.  Yes.  White privilege is us.  Let's talk  a little bit about Equifax,  shall we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have  a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ask. Ask me.  I love Brian Krebs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brian's been covering this so well in his Krebs on  Security. The latest from  Brian Krebs is that he  checked out the  Argentinian affiliate  of Equifax.  And they...  It's so funny. This actually  his information comes from Alex Holden  of Hold Security.  Apparently, the website  Equifax website  in Argentina, and they call it their  employee portal. They call it Veraz,  or truthful in Spanish.  And it's now down, thank  goodness. The login and password  for the site was admin  admin,  which is probably the first one you'd guess.  Once inside,  researchers were able to log in and they could  view the names of more than a hundred Equifax  employees in Argentina, their employee  IDs and email addresses.  There was a list of users' page featuring  a clickable button  that anyone with the admin admin  username and password could use to add, modify  or delete user accounts on the system.  They  then found a list  of people who had disputes  with the  credit reporting agency.  And it listed  715 pages worth of complaints and  disputes. In each case  it had the person's DNI,  which is their Argentinian social security  number, in plain text.  And it had 14,000  records, name  and  social.  This was all publicly  available. All you had to do was guess the password  admin admin. So  Equifax is not exactly  holy cow.  They're not exactly escaping this  unscathed, let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my god, they so are.  And the audacity that  they have to behave that they, the way they  just, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  let's talk about it. We spent some time talking  about yesterday too on security now. It was a data  breach that had occurred some months  ago. Equifax said we discovered it July 29th.  Before they told  us though, they made sure that any executives  who wanted to sell their Equifax stock got to  three executives, including their CFO  sold off Equifax  stock worth millions of dollars.  They said later, oh  they didn't know. They didn't know.  They just decided  to sell stock all of a sudden.  Personal data including birth dates, credit  card numbers and more obtained by hackers  for a hundred forty three  million US customers.  Then Equifax  added insult to injury  by putting up a website that you could ostensibly  go to and find out if you were one of those people  whose information was leaked.  It seemed to do nothing. It randomly  picked, you could  enter any number or name and it would, you know,  pick a random choice. Yes, you were hacked. No, you  weren't hacked. Maybe you were hacked. Come back later.  Come back later. It was random.  Please check back again in another time.  And then, and then this is where they really,  I'm sure this is what insulted you.  It sent you to a free one  year credit monitoring service of theirs,  which of course won't be free  in a year. So they're going to try  to make money on this breach. And  now I don't think this is  Jermaine, but some complained  that the agreement that you  agreed to when you signed up for their free credit  monitoring service said you couldn't sue them.  It's true. It was a binding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  arbitration clause that you signed up for.  Equifax says that applies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  only to the credit monitoring and not to the  breach. I mean,  you'd be foolish to have anything to do  with Equifax anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, well, nobody has a choice.  Equifax just hoovers up all this data  and sells it to people. So, it's  not like, it's not like any, any  normal person's like, oh, I think I'm going to  do business with Equifax today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an invisible data broker. I should say  do anything, any more business with them.  Don't go to their site at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you have to, because the best  way to... No, you don't.  That gives you no information.  So you have to, you have  to deal with them because you're going to need to put  a freeze on your account. In that respect,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you should deal with them. Exactly. Yes. You shouldn't go  to this am I hacked site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, well, it's  gotten better, but  they do, they do not make it clear.  They...  For a company,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to me shows how corrupt the American  system is in so many ways  that these guys  actually said, hey, oh,  we just really screwed up on this one.  So we're going to, we're going to sell our stock  first and then we're going to deal with it by  coming up with things  that are the bare minimum. And  we're going to piss off a bunch of  consumers with  like the crappiest web design, poor hosting  and just  complete and utter idiocy.  It's really stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're saying people should go, and  I don't know if everybody needs to do this, but you're saying  people should go to the big  three and maybe the fourth. There's another one,  Anovis credit reporting agencies  and put out a credit freeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the pros and cons  of doing a credit freeze are  you have to do it.  You have to call them all individually. There are fees.  Equifax says that it will not charge  its fees to people freezing their credit after  this. If they were really good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually, I want to correct that. There are fees  in some states. Some states,  it's up to the state legislature. The state legislature  mandates the fees.  In California, it's $10  per agency to freeze  and unfreeze. But in some  states like Maine and Wisconsin, it's free.  So it may be free for you.  I think it was free for me. I had to freeze.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when you do a freeze, it takes  time to do and it takes time to undo.  So you can't apply for credit  if you have the freeze or you can apply.  You just won't get it.  And a  notable thing is, you know, this  iPhone coming out, I believe  an Apple, is it the Apple  monthly payment program?  So sometimes you're cell carriers  or to buy a phone.  A lot of times people pull credit reports that you don't even know.  If you're applying for a job, that may happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's less concerning.  If you're renting an apartment, that may happen.  Yes.  And yes, cell phone companies  very routinely pull credit history.  So, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you undo  your freeze, you're going to have to pay  sometimes, not everyone,  to put it back on. So  this is  terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is terrible. It's non-trivial.  You can do a fraud alert. It's really not much  particularly effective. It just let you know  if somebody's trying to get a credit card  in your name. Basically,  people complain about privacy with  Facebook and Google, but we've got these  companies that's one and only  job is to collect every bit of information about you.  They can and sell it to people  without your participation or knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These companies basically shouldn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute though. Don't they have to? I mean, honestly,  if you're going to have a credit,  if people are going to extend you credit, there needs to be  some organized way to find out  if you're credit worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll do a star rating system.  Who will do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what your FICO  score is. But who will do it?  Somebody's got to do this.  And by the way, you agree to it every time you take out  a loan or you get a credit card in the fine  print. It says, you agree that we'll  submit every bit of information about you,  including your pay history to Equifax

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TransUnion. So this is  an area where regulation  is important because clearly  the way we have  set up our economy around  credit, you know, it has  become a valuable tool and you have  to regulate these. And what's  astonishing to me is the  lack of  regulation for something that  actually Congress has given a lot of  what's it called  when you talk  about something but you don't do anything about it?  Lip service.  Lip service. I was like lipstick on the pig.  They've given a  lot of lip service to this. They've held actually  a lot of hearings about it and every time  the rules come in weaker  than expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's ironic but Equifax was lobbying  hard and paying a lot of money to  campaign funds  to get the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau  dismembered and to change the rules  so that they weren't as  accountable. I mean, they hate this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the bare minimum that they have to comply  with today is so inconvenient to  their making dobs of money without  any sort of responsibility or accountability.  Which is  I'm not going to get on this because  it is not  anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the Equifax story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's my question.  And I've said this on the show before but I still don't understand.  Aren't we looking at this the wrong way?  We know there are going to be breaches of data.  There have been breaches of data.  Half of America is now breached.  There's going to be breaches of data.  The problem is the other end of it.  People with that data  should be able to do nothing with it.  Which means that what we have to fix  is transactions.  Blockchain.  Well, blockchain  two factor. Call it what you will.  But  the one way or the other, we've got to change  the transactional structure so that if you have  my name and social security number, who cares?  You can't do jack with it.  Birthdate. Mother's maiden name.  Obviously there's problems for phishing.  Obviously there's problems where you can fool an individual.  Obviously an idiot on an important  account can have a bad password. That's always  going to be true.  But even then, if you have two factor,  if you have other structures, if you change the  level of  transactional security.  I wish Steve were on because he knows a lot more  about this than I do. But you're the next best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so  I've pulled up a paper from  the Federal Reserve Bank on the  history of credit reporting.  We haven't always had these credit  bureaus. In fact, they didn't  really begin  until this century.  The credit reporting industry started  in the 50s and 60s and it was very  industry specific.  So a banking industry would  have somebody kind of compile files  on people. By the way, they would  look for newspaper clippings about  arrests or promotions or marriages  and deaths and they would be attached  to a consumer's credit  report. It wasn't until the 70s  that an industry,  this Equifax trans-union  industry began.  And the passage of the Fair  Credit Reporting Act in the 70s  did actually, as you know, I mean  we have a lot of protections with these agencies.  We can see our credit history.  We can ask for our credit report once  a year for free. We can amend  it. We can put notes on it. We can ask for  it to be corrected. They stopped putting  marriages, promotions and deaths  in the file. They were limited on what they  could collect. Experian  was originally TRW.  You know that name.  Trans-union and then  Equifax all  kind of were created in  the 70s.  I think you need something like this.  Credit  is really important. It's  actually one of the great inventions  of capitalism. It wasn't  I'm reading a book about this  and it was fascinating that  in the Middle Ages, remember, it wasn't  considered a reputable to  lend money.  Because there was no expectation of growth.  It was felt that it was a zero  sum gain and that anybody's success  was at somebody else's debt to somebody  else's detriment. They didn't understand the notion  of value creation.  So nobody lended money. It was Shylock,  right? And it was a  serious rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a Christian thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't considered Christian to do it. We had to make  the Jewish people do it.  The tribe was responsible for it.  But when  the notion of capital  investment  and venture investment  and lending was created,  it created immense wealth and immense  value. So it is a very valuable system.  And you can understand why  there would need to be some way of proving  or demonstrating  that you were credit worthy. Otherwise,  how would you go to a bank and ask for a loan  for a hundred thousand dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with credit. There's nothing wrong with credit  data. If it's transparent,  it doesn't screw you up. What's wrong  and so there's nothing wrong with  people having data about you. They're going to have that data.  My point is that  what we're...  So what was wrong here was to give you the breach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's well known how to secure that.  So  this has been proposed. Actually, Corey Docter  wrote a funny column in Boing Boing  that said there should be a death penalty  for corporations.  That sometimes corporations should commit crimes  so heinous that they should be  just dissolved. The government should say, you know what?  You're out of business. I don't know if I agree  with that. But there definitely  need to be very strong  punishments for not  treating data like this securely.  And by the way, I believe  it is known how to secure this data.  Leo, you're still not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what's your question?  My question is the opposite. Let us presume  data will be breached, period.  The problem with it is, is what can  the bad guy then do with  the data? The bad guy can...  That's what we have to secure.  Is the other end of this problem.  We know how many times we have to get breaches before  there's going to be breaches. Somebody's going to mess that up.  There's going to be breaches. Well, it's kind of a done deal.  Exactly. You go out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why you shouldn't go to the Experian  website. You should just assume that your credit  cards and your phone numbers and your  socials out there. So why do we

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fear the data being out there? What can be done with that data?  What do we do about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's identity theft where somebody  assumes your identity applies for credit using  your social and your birth date.  You have good credit, but they don't  intend to ever pay any of these credit cards off  or pay off any of these loans. So they use  your good credit to generate a lot  of fraudulent loans.  And your credit is destroyed.  So that's one way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is saying,  he is asking what can be done  to make this information, which today  can be used to do all of that,  useless. So what do you add  to it? So can you...  What do you add to the transaction we then do?  How do you add friction to the  basically creation of a credit card? So better authentication

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  systems would be good.  Obviously, the government even  says do not use your social for  identification. But  everyone requires your government.  So that is a number that is  difficult to change. By the way, your fingerprint  is impossible to change.  It is also now being widely used for  identification. Both of these are very  bad ideas. But  I'm not sure if we have any better ideas.  By the way, authentication  is the number one issue  in finance.  In everything. Is proving you are  who you say you are. It's why passwords don't  work, because that's an authentication system.  It's why we've got this problem.  Because it's very difficult  absent  an in-person meeting. And even  then, you can impersonate me.  It's very difficult to authenticate  somebody's identity. I don't know. You would chip them.  I don't know. There is no system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even authenticate. So can we add like  two-factor to it? So I apply for a credit card.  And then, this actually happens  when you implement a credit freeze.  You actually have to call them  ahead of time. They run the credit  card report and they actually will call  you again and say, hey,  this happened.  I think it's very hard to think. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your question. I just think it's very hard to think  of a system  of perfect authentication.  Because that's what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't need perfect authentication. You need  multiple layers of  imperfect authentication that together  cover the CYA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And increase the cost and the risk for the bad guy.  So let's say you say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need you to have  your social and I need a fingerprint  and I need a password.  Where is all that stored?  There's going to be a central repository  that's stored. That's the problem.  That's the real problem is  that Equifax had your authentication  information. All of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are steps that you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do things that...  You need two agencies. Maybe three.  And you'd have to hope  that a bad guy didn't  compromise all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean that is  a lot harder. I mean that's  basically where all security needs  to go is recognizing  that anything centralized  will break. That's why blockchain  is so interesting.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway.  My point is that authentication is...  Everybody knows this is the issue.  And everybody's working on  good systems of authentication.  But I see so little work on it.  Well, yeah. But there is a lot of work being done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of work. The challenge is  everything sucks  from a convenience and...  I mean security is... There's a trade off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's also standardization. You can't  have something... You have to get it adopted by the entire...  Here's what I would argue. And I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this is the argument that's current. This is the situation  we currently live in. Doing it right  is far more expensive than  what we have right now which is allowing a certain  amount of fraud to occur.  Well... It's the same reason banks  don't really report breaches.  It's cheaper to pay off  the loss and continue business  as usual than to fix the problem.  That's interesting.  So I would... And I think that that's part of...  This is a little bit of a tempest  in a teapot because...  Well, we'll see in a couple of years  if there's a massive uptick in  identity theft. I bet there won't be.  People are freaking out  that their information's out there.  But it may not have  a huge consequence.  You know, from a philosophical point  of view it's a bad thing. It's a terrifying  thing. But it may not actually  be so consequential. And it's certainly  the case that doing it  right would be very  difficult, expensive, and  inconvenient.  You could have...  You could use PGP keys.  You know what? A good solution  for this...  PGP is a very good authentication  system and the web of trust.  There are systems.  But it's really a pain in the ass.  I use it. If you get email from me it's usually  PGP signed to verify that it came from me  and it hasn't been modified.  And you can... If you were running PGP,  which nobody does, you could then look at that  and validate it and say, oh, that came from Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many efforts...  PGP  or some equivalent  could be made safe for consumers.  That's an area where I've been frustrated that no one's ever done it.  It could be done easily. Each of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  each of us would have two keys.  A public key and a private key. You would tell  everybody your public key so that they could use  that to encrypt data to you,  which only you could decrypt. But the keys can  also be used for authentication.  You can give out your  public key. If somebody says, oh,  hi, Jeff. I have your public  key here. Can you authenticate?  Can you prove to me that it's you? And you run it  through a program that says, yes, Jeff has the  private key. Now you would have to keep  the private key private.  And you could mess that up.  Well, and you can... And there's ways to fix that  to require... You know, you require expiration  every year. You have to generate a new one.  And you need a key revocation  system. This has actually been a problem on the web  with certificates. There isn't a good key revocation  system because it's been deemed  too difficult to do well. It would slow your browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  down too much. You know, my hope is  that a really smart company like Google to do this.  But if they can't figure out two accounts within their own  email system, then... I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think people... I think people  are really working on this.  But the cost  of doing it probably outweighs  at least so far  the losses.  Okay, but here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one piece of that is that at some level,  I as a consumer, rather than...  What do we have now? We have all these scary, scary  commercials on Sirius  saying that your identity is going to be stolen  and your mortgage is going to be stolen.  And so there's a huge  industry of  fakers  who just... Who sell you  a fake insurance because it's cheaper for them.  Because they're going to take all your grandparents  and your parents and they're going to make you pay for this stupid  service that actually doesn't do anything because  it happens so rarely.  So there is a cost to the economy right  now of taking advantage of old  people and fools who buy these services.  The company denies there's a cost. Just as Sony

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  decided, we're not going to spend money to secure  our studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but there's another way to look at this, which is that  rather than buying that scary,  scary service, I could  choose to go to the inconvenience  or the expense as an individual to say,  steal my data? I don't  care because I know that everything is okay.  What would that look like?  And then what you're going to see happening down the line  I think, is you're going to see that being  added on as a benefit to credit cards  and other things to make sure you're secure  or there's consumer value. But right now  there's no choice. There's no way. There's no mechanism  to do that. So we sit here and we all  say, uh oh, it all got stolen. I don't know, it's going to hit me?  It may hit me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we might overstate the threat. I mean,  banking rules change so that you couldn't lose  more than 50 bucks in your credit card, right?  That made everybody  happy. The credit card companies knew that  they were covering their losses with a high interest  rate. They knew that their losses wouldn't exceed their revenues  so they were okay. You were okay  because you knew your losses would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  limited. But now you're not okay.  I mean, your credit,  your losses  on the credit card are nothing compared  to your losses from identity theft  and the time and effort it takes to clean that  up. And as that happens to more people,  there are external costs that are  borne by employers, by insurers,  and by even, you know,  municipalities  that we  will have to pay for.  Somehow. Somewhere.  And it's not going to be as simple  as forking over money to  one entity. And that's  I mean, security  a lack of focus on security  is going to start becoming  a huge externality  that we need to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At some point we'll hit a tipping point. Here's the  stats on identity theft  and fraud complaints. And as you can see,  they are going up. In 2016,  $16 billion  was stolen  from 15.4 million  U.S. consumers.  I don't know if that's identity  theft or credit  card fraud. I think that would include credit card  fraud as well.  And, you know, and other things.  So two things can happen.  Somebody can defraud  you by using your  credit. But far more common is  they steal your credit card.  Right? It's a lot easier for bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the credit company loses. And then you report it in time and the  credit company loses money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Maybe the merchant  gets dinged. It didn't used to be.  Whoever has the least security gets dinged.  The merchant may end up spending the  bulk of the cost. But it's spread  out to the point where nobody's freaked out.  Start thinking about what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to channel you, Stacy.  This is a need for regulation.  Consumer protection. By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's a lot of regulation in this. That's why you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not just consumer protection.  They're real. Like, if my identity  is stolen and my... I have a  very good credit rating. So  I am a lovely consumer for lots of people.  I can go buy a house. I can go do all this.  But imagine now that I've put a credit  freeze on my account.  Suddenly, I'm less likely  to go... I'm only going to get credit on things  that really matter, like a house.  So there's a lot of things that I'm just not going to  buy if I can't buy it outright.  And then there's also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's an interesting statistic.  Most of this  misinformation misuse  has been used to get government  benefits. 49%  credit cards.  15% credit card fraud.  10% phone or utilities fraud.  5.9% bank fraud.  Attempted  identity theft. 3.7%.  Loan fraud. 3.5%.  So the... Almost half  is somebody just  saying, I want to get social security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait. Is that someone's...  So is that  stolen from buying it  online or is that something like... Because a lot of  really crappy parents use  their kids or... Right.  Use their kids social... So that's a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  type of security. I know. I don't know if... This is  complaints. This is based on the complaints  from identity theft and fraud  complaints for 2015.  So I would say if it's  a parent stealing their kids' stuff, there probably was no  complaint filed. But maybe the government  filed a complaint eventually. No, the government can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  file a complaint or...  I just...  Taking someone's government  benefits from a social security  theft seems like...  I guess it takes  all kinds. It doesn't seem like it'd be super

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  lucrative. But I guess  if you got a bunch of people's... I think that's kind of... I guess  what's interesting about these numbers is  it's clearly not reached the level of concern  yet or we would do something about it.  I think  we're getting there. I think we may be getting there.  These briefings... But  it's infuriating because  Equifax had a higher duty  to protect us and did not...  They didn't even show much  shame or regret or remorse.  That's the worst of it.  They didn't do their job.  They had one job.  If they're going to collect that information to protect the information,  they clearly didn't do a very good job of that.  But the consequences  may not be...  I think that's really what happens.  Once the consequences of the financial  industry is high enough, they'll figure out  a solution. I think there are solutions out there.  Interestingly,  cyber crime  complaints have actually been going down  a little bit. They were higher  in 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if that's because people... Wait, what is a  cyber crime complaint? What does that entail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Internet Crime Complaints Center.  I don't know what that is.  Top 10 states by percent  of US cyber crime victims.  14% from California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that could be  I sent somebody in Nigeria  my bank account.  Or it could be...  That could be stalking someone on Facebook.  I don't know. What is a cyber crime?  This page

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is from the IIII.org,  the Insurance Information Institute.  A lot of these numbers come from  reputable sources, including the Federal Trade Commission.  Who is reputable anymore?  I know.  Everybody's got an axe to grind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Leo,  it could be worse.  You could be Denny's.  I could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  eating the early bird special at Denny's right now.  In fact,  I'm on my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have seen, haven't you?  You haven't seen?  Denny's has a new mascot.  Oh, Lord.  He's not named Leo, is he?  No, no, no.  It's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Denny's mascot.  Oh my God, it's a sausage.  No, it's poop.  Oh, it's a dookie.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The entire internet is going crazy.  Because Denny's mascot is poop.  Here's the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Denny's turd is here with lunch.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Denny's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's even worse than Bodega.  What is it supposed to be?  I have no idea, but it's a turd.  You can't not see the turd now.  It's a turd with a megaphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got to be a breakfast link, right?  It's a breakfast link.  Actually, he's been around since 2014.  Oh, yes?  But the social media  stardom just happened.  Just hit. Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  See what happens.  Wow. Well, I've learned something today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  I can bring the show down anytime.  He could be named Little Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  The missing link.  That's pretty funny.  This spring, he introduced Denny's  On Demand. His name is Sausage.  Really?  You want to watch the video?  Nope. I want to get to our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  things because I am hungry  and I have to go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you were going to lose your appetite here.  Well, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before... Let's do it.  Why don't we do it? Stacy,  what is your thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, do you have an ad?  No, I did the ads.  A little hot diggity.  I'm all caught up. All three of them.  I can't find the link to it.  But this is...  Now I'm not prepared.  I was not ready for such a quick transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to make my thing  the Note 8, but I really  already talked about it. The only flaw at all  is the weird fingerprint reader,  but it's a beautiful phone.  Second flaw, you're right. It's tall.  It's weirdly tall, but much like the  Samsung Galaxy S8. In fact,  it's really pretty much identical to the S8 Plus  with the exception of a dual  lens camera, which is quite  good. And it has the zoom  just like the Apple iPhone 7 Plus  and a stylus that lets me  write down notes  even without unlocking  the phone. I'm a Note fan.  I have been since day one.  It's got a type C charger  and it has a headphone jack.  And I'm going to take it  to Europe with me.  Even though I can't  use Google Fi with it, which is too bad.  Wish I could.  Wish I could.  Now, Stacey, did I stall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  long enough? Now, you did. That was beautiful.  All right. So, I got to  get us on the thingy.  Great. Behind me  is a light. This is  the new Sylvania  Smart Plus LEDs.  Now, this one that I've linked to  that works with Amazon Echo  and Google Home. This one that I'm playing with  works with  the HomeKit. Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Finally. Yes.  Oh, that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. So, proper lower

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  third. It not only changed the light,  it changed the lamp. Oh, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just because it's a glass lamp.  It's a blue glass lamp.  No, it's pink now.  OK. Well, there you go.  It's so fancy. Fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look like Happy  Hotpoint demonstrating that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff does.  Good. It's good. Should we look up Happy Hotpoint?  Yeah, you know who Happy Hotpoint was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. I'm going to show you how this works on HomeKit.  So, this is dimming.  Oh.  There it goes. Were you disappointed that Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  didn't say anything about the HomePod at their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  end? I was. I was very sad. I felt like  maybe this is bad news for the HomePod.  And it does 1600 RGB  colors. And  the cool thing is, he doesn't need a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a strange number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1600? 16000? It must

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do 16000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  16000. That's what I meant. Sorry. Too many zeros.  I'm looking at something  else. 16250  And it even gets my favorite  color, which is that turquoise that the  original hues didn't do. This used to be  very difficult. Now it's not.  So, this is the  Sylvania. It's a reasonably priced  hubless light bulb.  And it is  available coming next Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two to the 16th  colors. That's my guess.  Could be just  1600. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you can control it via Siri.  Can you say? Give me a  blue? I believe so.  I did all this  last week and then I left home and  forgot all about it. Do you like this better than the hue?  This is  nice because  it doesn't have a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually it's two to the eighth. It's 16000.  There you go.  I gave it too many colors. Two to the eighth.  I mean, some of these  colors can't really get to.  Never mind.  Your biggest test in LEDs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is usually the turquoise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many bits is it?  Two to the  16th, right?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  To the 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one is  a B2 light bulb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bands needs a vacation. Two to the 15th.  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the people asking,  I'm going to answer your question while Leo goes off  in his little binary  challenge. Is it ZigBee or Z-Wave?  It is Bluetooth.  What?  What? I know.  So it works directly with your iPhone.  And then the  Amazon one, I believe, is  Wi-Fi, which is why it  doesn't need a hub. If it had ZigBee, it would  need a hub. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So. Could be two to the 13th.  That would be 8,192.  Or two to the 12th.  That would be 4,096.  But I think it's two to the 14th.  That would be my guess. That would be definitely  two to the 14th.  Sheldon would know.  Definitely two to the 14th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait. This one.  I'm sorry. I lied to you.  The one that I linked to,  so the HomeKit one is Bluetooth.  The one that I linked to is actually ZigBee.  So you have to work with the Echo.  You have to use a hub.  I'm so sorry, you guys.  See, this one is  the Smart Plus that talks about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  HomeKit.  This is why IoT  is in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is a nightmare.  But I trust no one to tell me  what happy hot points.  Thank God we have happy hot points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have happy hot points.  Siri, schedule my living room lights to turn on at 6pm tonight.  In a lovely blue shade.  That is too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for Siri today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Siri says screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's too much for anybody.  The only company that can do that is a company called  Josh.ai, but they're professionals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh really?  Who is this Josh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is this Josh? It is a company called  Josh.ai. They built their own voice  recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a better one.

Transcript:  Now, Stacy, do you know who that is?  It's someone we know.  Patty Duke? Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Close.  Julie Andrews?  No, close.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd be happy to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  associated with this person.  I love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, you kind of remind me of her.  Mary Tyler Moore  was happy hot point.  That's her dancing.  And there I am.  Wow.  Aren't you sorry  you work with two old men?  Oh yes, for many reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are times where I'm like, huh,  I'm questioning my choices right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's as bad as it could get.  It's really as bad as it could get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't get mad about Mary Tyler Moore.  It's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Who were those guys on the Muppets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the  critics?  Yeah.  Those who are my favorite people.
