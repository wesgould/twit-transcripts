And of course, think up is still the thing. Think up.com. Get your free trial right now. And I'm Leo Laporte dot think up.com. I think I'm I think you can see my stuff. It's public, right? Yes, it is. I've been using Twitter a lot more.  Lately. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know why. That's funny. I was just talking to somebody who said they're losing Twitter less. I've been using Twitter less. I just I could I go through phases. I go through phases. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I'm feeling talkative and sometimes not so much. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes I'm very join conversation more. I like Facebook. True. And then but I go through the same ups and downs with Facebook. Yeah. Well, you know, so so the other day, I was  reading Facebook and I realized, boy, I'm I'm just reading a lot of the Washington Post now. Their strategy of putting things up on instant articles. I agree. And Al Jazeera plus you told me about AJ plus. Yeah, AJ pluses. I agree. I think it is a great way. And look what you did. You you you already are on there with I see more Jeff Jarvis on my Facebook feed that I do almost anything else. Sorry. But when I see something like this happen, you know, Bob Elliott passing.  Facebook and Twitter are the places where the conversation happens, aren't they? Yeah. And that's so much better than reading a New York Times obituary, you know, and saying, hey, honey, you know what? I like that that we can kind of have that dialogue. It seems like a healthy tribute.  You know, people are sharing their favorite Bob Arrey routines, which is the best way to remember. Yeah, yeah, it's nice when there's and again, thanks to YouTube. Otherwise, what would you do? We can hear. We can relive the memories.  For somebody who talks as fast as I do, that really drives people crazy when I try to talk that slow because it just isn't me. You know what? This is this is the normal me. What do you think? What do you guys think? You know, this is not the first presidential election with the benefit of Twitter and Facebook. We had a four years ago. We didn't really have them eight years ago, but we had them four years ago. I mean, we did technically have Twitter and Facebook, but I don't think they were as widely used. What do you think? And each time we have a quadrennial event like this, they're really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is a big shift over four years. The role of Facebook and Twitter will be this election year. Gina? I mean, bigger than ever. I mean, I think the role is as big as it is in people's lives. And these services have become, I think, embedded in more people's lives than anywhere else. I mean, God, I'm not looking forward to the Facebook political debates between the various branches of my family. I know. I mentioned this before, but what I did is I followed all the candidates, even Trump and I'm a Democrat.  But even the Republican candidates, because I wanted to add that content to my feed. Yeah. Yeah. See what they're doing. I liked it. I already find myself kind of covering my eyes when I see certain hashtags trending or whatever on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, I just can't. I'm not ready for this. I'm trying to force myself to get out to if there is such a thing as a filter bubble. And I know Jeff Jarvis, you argue against that notion that we it's self reinforcing.  We see more of what we believe and less of what we don't believe. But if it is to the degree that's real, I try to consciously add opposing viewpoints. And I know, Gina, it's hard. Sometimes you get angry.  But I'm trying not to be. That's good. Good for you. I'm trying to be the new thing. And it comes from this triangulation we did with a guy named Jonathan Haidt. He's a moral philosopher, moral psychologist. He's a professor of psychology at NYU.  Who studies morality. And his book, The Righteous Mind, it was a really good subject. But he said, what we lack now is something he called intellectual humility. The idea that maybe we're not right about everything. And openness to other people's ideas. And I'm trying as best I can to be intellectually humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that scene in Inside Out, the Pixar film Inside Out, where they're on the train of thought and the box falls over and all this stuff tumbles out and Joy says, oh, these facts and opinions, they just all look the same.  Don't worry, that always happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's facts and opinions. They just they all look the same. And they always back out again. Right.  Isn't that wonderful?  There definitely is. I love that. I love that phrase, intellectual humility. People get really, especially around political issues, just get so passionate, right? And then you tend to, you know, just become full of self-righteousness about your opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, is social media going to give us an opportunity to do a better job this year of electing a candidate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm afraid. And I'm always the optimist, you know, you know, the title of Joe Trippi's book, Revolution Will Not Be Televised, who would imagine the revolution will be tweeted and imagine that that tweet would not be occupied Wall Street or Black Lives Matter, that it would be Donald Trump, who has used social media absolutely brilliantly.  I wrote a post the other day on Medium arguing that the primary system is fundamentally racist because the two first states are 94 and 91% white, respectively. It's the angry white people, it's petticoat junction in a bad mood.  And so what we see there is constituents who are left out of that process. And yeah, they may be able to talk on Twitter, but I don't think we see them much.  So under the bottom of other, I just put up a very good post from Alyssa Miller, who is the CEO of Public Radio International, PRI, who goes through the numbers on the candidates and their tweets and their social status.  She said the only two candidates seen accelerating growth in social media followers in September are Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're the front runners in the Republican Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The only one candidate has seen more than 50% growth in the rate of followers in that time Bernie Sanders, which is up a whopping 80%, though I suspect his was very low before.  She says the Sanders overall growth rate is phenomenal. It started with a low rate. The rapid decline of Ben Carson is clear. So you do see a reflection here.  Cruz has a slight lead on Rubio and social followers. So that's tracking to where Iowa was starting to go.  Hillary Clinton, who is my candidate, full disclosure, has seen a lot of growth.  But the bottom line is that I think that we're not seeing the people kind of taking over. We're seeing people with media power like Trump using that power, carrying that media power over Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am going to offer a somewhat different viewpoint because I'll tell you what's in. I mean, I agree with you that his media power is sort of, you know, because of his many years on reality TV is certainly a big asset for him.  But there's another thing that I noticed of all of the candidates who tweet. He's the only one who actually does his own tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's true.  There's something to be said for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, there is. Absolutely.  And in fact, I think that it meshes perfectly with his appeal, which is he's seen as a guy who speaks his own mind, who does it was unfiltered, unmoderated.  And if you look at Hillary Clinton's Twitter feed, you couldn't imagine a more moderated, filtered feed.  It's like campaign soundbite after campaign soundbite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, eight years ago, we talked about the YouTube election and the candidates all made YouTube videos there.  And in the UK, at the same time, camera was making YouTube videos and they were intimate.  I've always said that someone's going to click on your nose and you're going to talk to them one on one.  But that's gone away, too.  So, yeah, it's just another way to get messages out.  And for Trump, he has no message.  He just has, you know, his bombast.  You're stupid.  He had a tweet which he deleted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is I'm not kidding.  This is a great, to a great degree, his appeal.  He tweeted that the Iowa caucus was illegally, the vote was illegally stolen by Ted Cruz.  And then a minute or two later, somebody, I can see the scene running into his office saying,  that is you can be sued now because that's liable.  And Trump said, oh, it's amazing they were able to get him to delete it.  But he deleted it and took the word illegally out.  But he still said, he still tweeted, the vote was stolen.  And that's part of his charm that he says these devil may care.  He says what he thinks.  Even if you disagree with what he thinks, he says what he thinks and nobody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a continuation of the reality show.  Right. I mean, he has a savviness around these tools because, I mean, he's been a media figure  and people watch because they just want to see what he's going to say next because they know it's going to be outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, he learned that from the World Wrestling Federation,  where he was very much involved in wrestling.  Somebody pointed this out and it's really true.  It's very much like wrestling.  But I also think that's why he didn't get the votes he thought he would get.  That's why he polled so much better than the actual of the votes.  Because people say, I like Trump, but when they actually comes down to voting,  at least some percentage enough to switch the result, thought better of it and said, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, I think it all went back up in its own way.  I just put a link up to an NBC story.  Yeah.  And I quote Donald Trump tweet based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa caucus.  Either a new election should take place.  Wow.  Cruz results nullified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a sore loser writ large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doubles down.  And he says he doubles down.  And unfortunately, that strategy is working and working extremely well, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's really kind of amazing to watch.  Yeah.  You know, as an orator, as a tweeter, as just a character, it's fascinating to watch  because he is so popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The state of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he  cheated a total fraud.  Wow.  Based on the fraud committed by Ted Cruz during the Iowa caucus, either an election should  take place or Cruz results nullified.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because he lied.  This is the illegal fraud.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just, it is fascinating to watch.  Too bad it's at such great stakes are involved because it'd be great just to, if we're just  a, you know, wrestling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing that struck me too, sorry, I wrote this post about the angry white primaries.  You know, okay, so I'm saying what I'm saying.  Yes, I'm a liberal.  And the personal attacks that then immediately, of course, follow.  You know, somebody's writes really long response on Medium.  You know, I can't stand people like you.  Somebody calls me a douche on Twitter.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You take that stuff so personally.  I've learned to just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is I don't think that that was the case in debate before.  You might say it about someone, but now you go to before the whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's ultimately democratic.  And so you have a, you know, 50,000 followers.  Four of them are going to call you names for not agreeing with them.  I don't think I think that's one of the things that is interesting about Twitter is it does  give much more weight to the strong voices in the crowd.  You know, the squeaky wheels, but at least everybody gets a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite is Mr. Jarvis, your Huffington Post article show how much of a far left  radical socialist you really are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what though?  I mean, you're not going to take good Lord.  I, you know, I just mute.  I'm not a socialist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a Hillary voter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  If you were socialist, you'd know what to do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about Google's quarterly results here.  Wow.  Although I mean, I think this is a great subject and we're going to be doing this for the next  eight months because I really earned nine months because I really think this is  going to be a social media election.  And any candidate wants to do well and so on.  Where are the other?  Yes, I think you're right.  Has to do and they're not doing a good job of using social media and maybe not Twitter  because Twitter is very is a relatively narrow slice, but they've got to use Facebook.  I think it's more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Facebook, I'm seeing the people and my son Jake is working for Hillary in New Hampshire  right now, by the way, and he's putting up posts and you see real people and you, by the way,  you see young people.  They don't all vote for Bernie.  They're with Hillary.  That's I think it's also about the campaign people saying things.  And Hillary's account then retweets that and you get more of a human voice there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is interesting.  Fascinating.  Frightening, frightening, but interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess a demagogue would be better able to use this because he or she  could use it unscrupulously perhaps.  That's exactly what's been happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You are going to get in such trouble with whatever Leo even allows us to talk politics.  Let alone says things yourself, your audience goes berserk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't name names.  I just said a demagogue.  I didn't say who the demagogues are.  In fact, I wasn't thinking of anybody specifically.  I was just thinking that that is one thing that does change is, you know, I mean,  Joseph Goebbels was a brilliant propagandist and instrumental to the success of Adolf Hitler  because he knew how to use mass media.  I mean, wasn't he like one of the first people to really use mass media effectively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I think that's the important point, Leo, is that I argue that the mass media business  model has died.  Thus, the concept of the mass dies.  And what we really see is a mess of mobs.  And the gross numbers for Donald Trump are not that huge, right?  The percentage of people who are actually going to vote in this party in these states  is not that gigantic overall.  As Nate Silver has been saying, when it was a little bit lower, it was the same number  of people who believe we did land on the moon or such things, right?  So the gross numbers are not big, but there's a sufficient mob, and I use that pejorative  term in this case, to get them up.  And same for Cruz.  Now, will I call Bernie Sanders people a mob?  No, but they behave in a way that is a small but passionate group of people.  And part of me loves that.  Part of me loves that you can have a mob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The mob are the people who disagree with you.  The passionate, small, passionate group of people are people you agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even the fact that anyone can find a community and join with that community and take action,  that's the part of the internet.  It leverages our strengths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as it fits into a system that is built for two parties,  we are seeing the old institutions being replaced by new structures,  and we don't know what to do with it.  So when you only have two parties and you can fight over that party in a primary system  and you can go even farther, Trump is showing you can go to the extremes.  In this system now, in this point in the election,  and there is no party institutional structure to stop that.  They don't know what to do.  So the things that I celebrate and like about the ability to find communities  and join together and act can also be used by, you know, demagogues.  And that's what we're seeing.  Gina, you actually analyze Twitter all the time.  Can you do a think up on Trump's account?  Crump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, think up is really set up to do for folks who often so we can get access to their tweets.  But I mean, listen, Trump, all of candidates tweets are public.  So we could we could do we probably should do an analysis.  So it's hard.  I should we should we should.  You know, it's hard.  Like I look at follower numbers.  It's so it's so easy to pump up your follower numbers.  And it really it really matters more like who are these people interacting?  Are they getting retweeted?  How many people are seeing there?  You know, how many eggs are actually responding to them?  Because these folks get we did some tracking the State of the Union a couple of years ago.  And there's just so much spam and so much garbage.  And yeah, I think I think think up could do some really interesting  stuff with with pruning with pruning out that stuff.  But this medium piece where where the author's comparing the follower account numbers,  I don't know if that's I don't think that's valid.  I don't know if that's really indicative of anything really that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I'm looking at that I think is really interesting.  I'm just looking at how well the candidates understand and use the medium.  And for instance, we were talking about how AJ plus puts captions on their Facebook video  because people aren't actually listening, scanning their feet with sound on.  So the audio autoplay video will start.  So they put captions.  So in effect, you're reading it.  And I noticed, for instance, Hillary Clinton's campaign videos now on Facebook have  AJ plus style captions.  Donald Trump's do not.  And it's that kind of savviness.  I would propose it's going to make a difference.  That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.  How a candidate understands the medium and uses it.  Clinton's doing Snapchat's.  And I bet that's very effective if you're trying to get a younger audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if Clinton is targeting women, she's got to be on Pinterest,  she's got to be on Instagram.  Interesting.  Instagram is actually a terrible content marketing tool.  You can't even link in the captions, right?  But people spend a lot of time on Instagram.  I actually been spending a lot of time on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does she have a presence on Instagram?  I haven't noticed.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm going to look right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is what...  That's the metric I'm most interested in.  Twitter is...  I think Twitter is really not a mainstream yet and probably won't ever...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was talking to somebody today who really, really knows Twitter  and he was arguing that Twitter isn't elite.  Yeah.  I think that's fair.  That's what's dominating Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not elite in the way we normally interpret elite.  No, Kanye is an elite.  Kanye is an elite.  It's a slice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's media people talking to media people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clinton is on Instagram.  Of course she is.  Her bio is doting grandmother among other things.  Same thing on Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  Oh, same on Twitter.  Okay.  Yes, they've got across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think she says mom, grandmother.  They're smart.  They're smart.  Yep.  And you know what?  Maybe it isn't the candidate somebody says in the chat room.  Well, come on.  It's not Hillary Clinton.  It's her team.  But of course not.  Candidate.  I mean, look, these people aren't tech.  And we don't expect them to be geeks.  We expect them, though, to be smart enough to hire the right minds.  And because that is a reasonable expectation for somebody who will run the country  that they can find and hire the right people.  Absolutely.  Right?  That's maybe more important than whether they tweet, to be honest.  All right.  Let's take a look at Google's results because they are now, ladies and gentlemen,  in a completely meaningless, speaking of meaningless horse races,  in a completely meaningless horse race, the most valuable company in the world.  Eclipsing Apple.  Public company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Jason Calacanis pointed out on Twitter on Sunday  that Vladimir Putin really is the most valuable company in the world.  But we just don't know the numbers.  Alphabet, right?  Not Google.  One thing that's good, though, about the new alphabet structure is we, I think,  know more about how Google did than we would have before.  There's more information, right?  More broken out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they broke it out.  There's Google's earnings and then there's other bets.  I hadn't even made the...  I thought that was funny that the other bets because alphabet.  And...  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other bets saw $3.6 billion operating loss.  Just half a million in revenue.  That's not a big surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right? I mean, there's no big surprise.  Of course, the non-Google companies are losing money.  They're designed to lose money.  They're long-term moonshot things.  Yeah, they're investments, exactly.  And Google's doing way well enough to cover all that.  So no one was surprised by that.  I didn't look deep into the report, but it sounds like other bets  is just what they're calling everything else.  So we actually don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they didn't say like, our autonomous vehicles losing this.  They didn't break it out that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That'd be pretty meaningless, actually.  Yeah.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google had a profitable, very profitable quarter.  Is there anything we can glean from this?  Let me look at mobile.  Was mobile revenue good?  They got $21.33 billion in revenue.  And all but 1% of that from, all but half a billion of that from the Google.  And as you can see, quarterly revenue up, up, up, up, up.  Well, you can see if you're watching video, this is the highest it's ever been.  And stock price graph looks surprisingly similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, this is a moment of my Apple fan friends who are always like,  they would always say, but like Apple makes more money.  Right.  And now I can finally say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Google's worth more.  18% increase in revenue year over year.  Income up 25.  I'm sorry, the operating margin is 25% up a mere point.  They mix up gap and non-gap.  So that makes it very complicated to summarize this.  What I'm really curious, see, they don't really break it down into remote.  I mean, mobile and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which Facebook basically does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we know Facebook's done very well on mobile.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think, I think it's a deserved, even though you're right, it's a fairly meaningless crown.  I think it's a very well deserved crown because Google  is changing the world more than Apple is, I think.  And has an impact and it's recognized for the value that it brings to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Advertising revenue up 17%.  I wish they broke it down to mobile and desktop, but they don't.  Yeah, I did too.  Okay.  Aggregate paid clicks, paid clicks on Google websites, paid clicks on Google, it's complicated.  We were talking about this on Windows Weekly about what a company reveals  and what it decides to hide, what they're required to reveal and what the shareholders  demand of them and how they bury the stuff they don't want anybody to know about.  I'm not sufficiently sophisticated to look at the numbers and know.  But the question you posed, Jeff, on your Medium post, is Google too big to love?  We do like the plucky upstart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And now that it's the biggest company in the world, the most viable company in the world,  my fear is that the target on itself gets even bigger and more neon bright, especially in Europe,  where you can just hear the people, well, they're the biggest company in the world  and they're doing this.  The biggest company in the world, they're doing that.  They're just too big.  And so, what does Google do about that?  And I've chronicled on this show quite a bit how I think they are making moves,  good and important moves toward publishers, which leads to AMP, whether that's a fork or not we  leave to last week, and other things that are good.  And they are trying to build new relations with publishers.  And I think that's great.  I remain disappointed it's primarily aimed at Europe, which means it's primarily a lobbying  effort, more than a product effort, but we're seeing progress there.  There's plenty of other industries that are equally scared of Google, automotive, health, travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's different ways to be scared.  So they're scared like these guys are doing such a great job, they're going to put us out of  business.  And they're scared like these guys are such a behemoth that their monopoly is going to crush us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously, even if it's the first fright, you're going to claim the second fright, no matter what.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like a lot of the fear of Google is not, they're not Microsoft.  They're not engulfed in devour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but here's that's where, you know, what made me think about the parallel, though, is that  Microsoft in 19, what, 88 was largest company in the world and EU went after them and, you know,  huge, huge issues around Microsoft.  What was one of the things that Microsoft did to make itself less like cold software and more  human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, because I read the piece they hired Scobel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you got to give old Scobelizer credit for humanizing Microsoft.  And so part of my point is that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just Scobel, by the way, but blogs in general.  They had a lot of, they suddenly spoke authentically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I suspect this will go over like a ton of lead balloons, but who is the Scobel of Google?  Matt Cutts.  You're right.  And they trust Matt Cutts to speak and to be human and well-liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that still true even with Matt on leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he seems to, he comes on and he talks about Google and nobody's saying,  hey, shut up.  You don't know crap.  You never hear that.  People respect Matt.  What I'm arguing is that in addition to having the kind of relations that Google needs to have  directly with industries around the world before they get all pissed off and use all  their political clout to fight Google, Google also needs to be more human and it needs to be  more open.  And the paradox here is that Google is more scared of us than we are of it when it comes  to opening up and being public.  They can't afford to be the silent giant anymore.  They can't afford to be the giant black box that runs the world.  They have to open up.  And one way to do that is to enable their smart, generous, amazing employees to speak  more, to talk more.  And I think Matt is a great model for that and not everybody can do it.  I grant that.  But I think that Google has to be very aware that its position as the most valuable company  in the world, the largest company in the world, the fastest growing company in history,  puts them in a position where they are going to get now even worse attention than they  did before and they have to act on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's another side effect of becoming big successful and that is people start leaving.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  We're talking about, it's called This Week in Google, but we're really talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but the internet, social media.  Anything we damn well want to.  I tell you, just try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just try.  People were complaining that we were getting political, but I don't think that was about  policies.  If we got political, we'd talk about various policy measures and who's doing what and why  you support one candidate or another.  What I was interested in is how the candidates are using modern technology to change.  Story, Leo.  I like this.  Good try not to get into that.  Did you gather from what we just talked about who I'm supporting?  Not Trump.  I didn't call him a demagogue.  You thought I called him a demagogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Who called Bernie Sanders a demagogue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I'm sure.  Bernie's kind of demagogic.  Bernie is a progressive demagogue.  He's telling the same story from the other side.  And you know the supporters of Bernie are very much like Trump's supporters.  Demographically.  Very angry.  They're disenfranchised, angry.  They feel like Wall Street is screwing them and only Bernie can save them.  What's very fascinating about when you get either extreme, there's similarities.  Somebody in the chat room says I'm voting for Amazon's Echo for president.  Damn straight.  Finally.  A president who will listen.  Our show today.  I'm so glad to have Gina here.  Gina, I'm sorry.  I had a force of habit.  Jeff and I dominate now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, the truth is it's always been that way.  And poor Gina has always had to fight her way.  And the fans like Gina best.  We know it.  I know.  We're just going to shut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do stay away from conversations about politics.  Why?  Partially because I'm not an expert.  Partially because I'm not an expert.  But that's the beauty of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to be.  Everybody has an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't.  I have zero opinion about politics.  I'm just going to roll with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  George Burns once said,  it's a shame that the only people know how to run this country are working in barbershops and taxi cabs.  Gracie.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.  Oh, I love Squarespace.  I've become a Squarespace born again Squarespace fanatic.  Always liked Squarespace.  Was always impressed by that technology.  But the more I use it, the more I love Squarespace.  The place to create your next blog or website or portfolio or use their cover page feature.  But did you know that Squarespace is great for commerce too?  They make it so easy to create a beautiful, professional online store.  First of all, your store is available and looks great and works great on any size screen.  That means whether it's a four inch mobile phone,  you got to be prepared because I bet you Apple's going to sell a lot of four inch mobile phones  come this spring versus a 55 inch television.  It'll look great on either size or all sizes because it's a responsive design  and their checkout on their commerce is mobile optimized.  You got to have that.  I hate a site that says, well, you can't buy it on our website.  Go to our mobile app or why don't you have our mobile app?  You don't have to worry about it.  You can sell unlimited products, no transaction fees.  All your data, your financial information is protected with state of the art.  The latest most modern technologies because these guys are geeks and they know what they're doing.  That's why a Squarespace site never goes down.  You can really trust Squarespace.  And with that dashboard, you can manage your business's workflow,  offer fast customer service.  Yes, this is all built in process orders, send shipment notifications, handle refunds in seconds.  They've even written an app.  This is so cool.  Not for your customers, for you.  So you can on iOS or Android fulfill orders.  The Squarespace commerce app, manage product inventory.  You can resolve customer issues on the go.  Look, you've got to power your business with Squarespace commerce.  The only platform that lets you create, manage and brand your store in a way that is beautiful,  that reflects your style, that looks like it's yours,  not some bland third party separate shopping cart somewhere out there.

Squarespace.com, just use the promo code TWIG.  That way you'll let them know you listen and you'll get 10% off.  Squarespace, you should.  You really should.  How serious is this?  Amit Singhal is retiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why, Amit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's joining.  I mean, you're seeing this across the board in the tech sector and I think it's a side of a  mature industry.  He's joining a number of other executives who decided, you know what, I have enough money now.  I've accomplished a hell of a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, is that it?  It's like 15 years, made a lot of money, like didn't spend a lot of time with my family.  I'm timed for me to go live my life now and let the youngins take over.  Is that what this is about, you think?  I feel so bad.  I love this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody does.  He was their wizard of search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it's quite significant that the person who takes over is artificial intelligence  and they're merging the artificial intelligence and search divisions.  That's extremely significant in my view.  That says the future of search is understanding what you need before you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Giandrea is taking his place.  Artificial intelligence used to be the whipping boy, right, Gina, for failed computer science  theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll never work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When did it become the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the fission of CS, eh?  It's fusion, not fission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got fission.  That's easy.  Unfortunately, it's the fusion that's hard.  Yeah, it was the pipe dream and all of a sudden now it's everywhere.  Did we just have a breakthrough at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we just lower expectations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or decide that the applications of it were smaller and modular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we changed the definition is what we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was just machine learning.  It's now machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought artificial intelligence was an attempt to make a computer think like humans  and everybody's kind of agreed that that's a silly goal.  But learning, you're right.  Smart get machines that get smarter that do a better job.  Would you call Google now artificial intelligence?  Well, yeah, I was just going to ask you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So give me an example of artificial intelligence that we use on a day-to-day basis.  Is Google search artificial intelligence?  You could argue that it is.  I mean, Google's crawlers and index constantly learning and connecting concepts and has an  idea of what concepts are, the knowledge graph and all that.  Is that AI like the way that we conceived it years and years ago?  Self-driving cars?  I don't know.  Self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Self-driving cars.  You know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a continuum.  So search when it was first constituted was clearly a mechanical process.  It was very obviously.  You could see the gears working.  But as computers have gotten faster, they're not getting smarter.  That's a misnomer.  But they're getting and they're better designed and they're more and they're accumulating  knowledge and we are doing better with taking the information, the big data that we've now  gathered all the time and applying algorithms to it so it looks smarter.  But I would submit it's the same gears.  They're just turning faster with more information.  Right?  Gina, you're a programmer.  That's why I ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lots more information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Big data.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at ThinkUp.  Is ThinkUp artificial intelligence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not at all.  It's a bunch of algorithms, a bunch of rules and it's a bunch of data.  Rules applied to a bunch of data.  So it's like you say, you know, if these patterns emerge in the data, then do this.  Although.  I mean, you do that over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's no accident that you call it ThinkUp, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, the URL was available.  No.  We needed a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I, well, it might've been unconscious.  But that's the implication.  You're thinking about the data.  This is the-  Yeah.  Is that the machine learning, the weird landscapes?  Yeah.  These are the weird landscapes created.  Jason just decided to freak me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is art created from the neural network learning stuff.  By the way, I don't think there's any evidence that neural networks have done.  Although, well, I just, no, I take it back because it seems trivial, but,  and this is of course where AI first emerges in the most trivial uses.  Um, but now on iPhones and Android somewhat, but mostly on iPhones, you see a  slew of apps that recognize your face and modify it like Snapchat's thing.  And it's because of the improvement of facial recognition algorithms  over time, thanks to neural networks applied to massive amounts of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus biometric security like Microsoft's.  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's face recognition.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's a form of-  Face recognition is not artificial intelligence.  That's easy.  How far apart your eyes are, it's measuring the face.  It's not hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about recognizing the same person from current age back to birth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little harder.  The hardest still is to look at a ton of faces and pick and say, and identify their names.  That's not what's going on in biometrics.  Biometrics is recording your face, matching what's presented to it, to those measurements.  That's easy, right?  That's easy.  That's not face recognition.  Face recognition is naming all the people in a crowd.  That's hard.  Although it's kind of an application of the same algorithm, I guess.  Gina, you know better than I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all about the data, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data is the key, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the rules plus the data.  It's the algorithms plus the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are the algorithms better?  The failed AI algorithms of-  By the way, Marvin Minsky passed away this past week.  Speaking of AI.  I wonder, boy, I'm sad I didn't get to talk to him  because he was the father of AI in many ways.  And I would be very curious, he was a co-founder of MIT's AI lab.  I'd be very curious what he thinks of modern AI.  You know, whether he thinks we did-  Is this AI the AI he was thinking of?  Marvin Minsky invented the first head-mounted graphical display.  Google Glass precursor.  It's his fault.  It's his fault.  He developed Logo with Seymour Papert in 1951.  1951, he built the first randomly wired neural network learning machine.  Nice name, too.  Snark.  Snark.  So it's kind of timely.  We should have spent more time trying to get him on.  But here he is, he just passed away, sad to say.  January 24th.  And I hope somebody interviewed him about the current state of-  Somebody had to have, right?  AI, what he thought of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I don't think it's his AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's the AI he envisioned.  But I might be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new head of search at Google says that the business intelligence told Fortune right away.  The business intelligence told Fortune recently that I think computers are remarkably dumb.  The computer is like a four-year-old child.  And so I think that there's an arm of this world that says,  relax those who fear it's going to take over the world.  It's not going to take over the world.  A good friend of mine today said,  he was amazed at the idea that God made us in his image and we're making a computer in our image.  This is our effort to think that we can make something that's like us.  But that may not be the most powerful thing there is.  It's a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really, Gina, does this sound correct?  It's not that the machines are so much more powerful.  Of course they are.  But it's more that the data, there's so much more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this computer is like a four-year-old child.  I feel like it gives a computer a little too much credit because four-year-olds are actually-  Yeah, smart.  Really smart, but they don't have a lot of data because they haven't been alive for long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well said, Gina.  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't mean to like-  I mean, I spend a lot of time around three and four-year-olds and they're super smart.  You tell them one thing, they connect ideas very quickly, faster than I think a computer.  But on the other hand, computers can calculate things.  Computers are just better at certain things than humans are.  But humans are certainly better at things that computers aren't.  So that's interesting.  I would say the four-year-old isn't actually that dumb.  Just lacks-  Short on data.  ... life experience, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see whether a computer can go potty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, it's big data and the ability to go through a lot of big data,  there's more than anything, there's more than intelligence that we're talking about here.  Yes, I think so.  Somebody mentioned this earlier today in the Chairman, I had looked it up.  This was among the other things we learned about the NSA, although this is pre-Snowden,  was a program called OpticNerve in which the British GCHQ was intercepting Yahoo webcam images  in bulk.  This is between 2008 and 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't make fun of the people who put the damn tape over their webcam anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because what they were doing is collecting big data.  They didn't care about those pictures.  They weren't trying to find crooks in those pictures.  They were trying to generate-  Oh, I guess this is Edward Snowden.  All right, this is from Edward Snowden's trove of documents.  They were trying to generate giant databases to improve image recognition.  The program OpticNerve saved one image every five minutes  from millions of Yahoo chat users' feeds.  They said they only got one image every five minutes,  partly to comply with human rights legislation,  but also to avoid overloading their servers.  This database, which I'm willing to bet is still in use, is really the beginning of this.  So it's just raw data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually been a theory of mine for a long time about the warrantless wiretapping  that was going on.  It's about the data.  It was about the data and about finding anomalies more than finding the crook.  I don't know that, but I just have a feeling that that was the effort.  Unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One document in the cache of documents from the GCHQ, the British spy agency.  Unfortunately, it would appear a surprising number of people use webcam conversations  to show intimate parts of their body to the other person.  Also, the fact that the Yahoo software allows more than one person to view a webcam stream  without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream  means it appears sometimes to be used for broadcasting pornography.  Undesirable nudity was in 3 to 11 percent of the webcam harvest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do they define desirable nudity?  I would generally define nudity as desirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's wrong with spies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not for facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're making war, not love, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too much flesh confuses the algorithm, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is possible to handle and display undesirable images.  There is no perfect ability to sense a material which may be offensive,  but users who may feel uncomfortable about such material are advised not to open them.  Jolly good.  Don't go in there.  There's nudity ahead.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I got sidetracked.  John Giandreia.  Nice Italian guy.  New VP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think his background is very interesting.  Tell me about it.  Came from...  He was a tele...  Chief technologist at Netscape.  That was when the browser came out in 1994.  CTO of TellMe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got him in the TellMe acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was then acquired by Microsoft in 2007.  That's right.  Microsoft bought TellMe.  He had a stint at General Magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody, you know what?  If you're going to find one source, one beginning, one blue-nile source  for all of the Silicon Valley's most interested in Silicon Valley is General Magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Stanford Research Institute.  And of course, PARC.  It's kind of the child of that.  So Business Insider on his LinkedIn profile,  one of his colleagues describes it this way.  There are three types of engineers.  Those who wanted to work for JG, those who wanted to work with JG,  and those who wanted to be JG.  He has far-reaching vision with the ability to go very deep, very quickly.  So I'm sorry we're losing Singhal, but it sounds like, of course,  Google is putting somebody in charge who's...  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing.  And an AI researcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or he also joined the company after Google bought his company MetaWeb,  which was the basis of Knowledge Graph.  Oh, wow.  He's qualified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  We'll give him a pass.  We'll give him a few weeks.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll give him a pass on the four-year-old comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would guess...  I'm not in the inner circle here,  but I would guess that there are people who within Silicon Valley  are well-known because they've been to those places and are highly regarded.  And they're just...  They're the cards in the deck that you want to add to your collection.  Interesting.  General Magic was created by Bill Atkinson, who was at Apple.  He was the genius behind the Macintosh internal routines,  the quick draw and the ROMs.  And in fact, it was a bunch of Apple people that went over there,  folded in 2002.  But boy, a lot of people got their start or worked there at some time,  including Gianandrea.  Gianandrea.  Gianandrea.  Gianandrea.  Gianandrea.  Gianandrea.  We're going to have to learn how to pronounce his name.  Gianandrea, I think is probably how...  Gianandrea, yeah.  Gianandrea, that's how you probably say it.  Bin John's probably illegal.  What a surprise.  I've been kind of critical of Bin John all along.  This is T-Mobile's very popular with its customer plan  not to count against you video you watch on Netflix and other streaming services.  YouTube is not part of Bin John, alas.  Why wouldn't subscribers like it?  But a new study from Stanford University says it violates net neutrality  and is likely, in fact, because of that, illegal.  Barbara Van Schwyck, the law professor who authored the study said  T-Mobile's Bin John is aptly named.  It feels good in the short term, but harms consumers in the long run.  Got to get a hangover, gain some weight.  The program limits user choice, distorts competition,  stifles innovation, and harms free speech on the internet.  If more ISPs offered similar programs, these harms will only get worse.  And this was always our criticism.  It puts T-Mobile in a position to decide who wins and loses on the internet.  For instance, Bin John supports VivoTV for watching music videos,  but doesn't make YouTuber Vimeo available.  It supports Ustream.  Fortunately, we use Ustream for live streaming video.  But that's an interesting point.  If you watch Twitch, you're now incented to choose the Ustream feed  instead of the Bit Gravity feed or the Twitch feed.  And those companies are disadvantaged.  Doesn't support Meerkat, doesn't support Periscope.  And now T-Mobile says, oh, anybody can sign up.  It's easy.  But the study also says technical requirements are more complicated  than T-Mobile claims and that the carrier is tilting the player  playing field to the advantage of larger firms.  Bin John allows some providers to join easily,  creates lasting barriers for others, especially small players,  non-commercial providers, and startups.  And that's the problem right there.  It rewards the incumbents and it stifles innovation.  Yep.  Sorry, John Ledger.  Starring.  Project Skybender.  So we knew about Loon, the balloon project,  that Google was putting balloons up in the stratosphere  to provide internet access wirelessly everywhere.  Elon Musk mentioned that he wants to launch  hundreds of low earth orbit satellites to do the same thing.  Facebook was playing with drones to do the same thing for internet.org.  Now there's Project Skybender, Google's secretive 5G internet drone test.  Appropriately enough tested near Area 51.  It's at New Mexico's spaceport authority and it's using millimeter wave,  potentially 40 times faster than 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As is the aerial founder who started...  Oh, yeah, he's got a new one, right?  Starry. Starry, yes.  You've got two millimeter wave...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Starry's commercial though.  And a number of people are wondering about that.  Yes.  Whether it's viable or not.  Is he using drones?  They're going to trial it in Boston this summer.  Starry is a one gigabit internet service.  You may remember Aereo.  That was the crazy plan to have dime sized antennas.  Rupert Murdoch behind it.  Dime sized antennas that would allow you to watch TV,  over the air TV on your iPad from New York City,  even if you weren't in New York City.  The Supreme Court put them out of business after lawsuits from the networks  who thought that was a very bad idea.  So this is his new project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Starry, you have to put an outside antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not the same antenna technology.  The problem is millimeter wave is not known to go a long way.  And because it's high frequency, it gets stymied by anything in the way,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  including rain.  It's fast though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the Starry beam radio that you would...  Oh my God, it's like a cell tower.  It's huge.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to put that in your house.  Okay.  I hope we don't see a lot of those in the air.  Anything else?  Let's see.  What else are you guys interested in?  Don't let me dominate the conversation.  Anything that piques your interest.  How about...  Podcasts and Google Play.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was just looking at that one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really want to see Google like go crazy with podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Leo, I'm really interested to hear what you think.  We've known about this for some time.  We were NDA'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah.  It turns out.  So when Lisa signs an NDA, one of the things she makes sure not to do is tell me anything.  She's smart.  Yeah.  So wait, so you were NDA'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the NDA up at this point?  Yeah.  Well, it is now because this has been published publicly everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So...  Okay.  That's one of the deals with NDAs is you can only reveal stuff that's commonly known.  Since I know nothing, except that we have been working with them.  Why hasn't Google started a massive podcast directory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why hasn't it done transcripts of every single podcast and made them searchable and linkable?  This is kind of my biggest complaint about podcasts is just that it's hard to find  certain places where people are talking about things.  And I feel like this is a job that Google could do easily with the suite of tools they already have.  Well, it's kind of what they're doing, right?  Isn't that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I guess you'd have to be a Play subscriber as opposed to just a user of Google Search.  I spend lots of money on Play.  Yeah, I love Play.  So do we as a company love Play now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're very happy about this.  But we're on Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very similar.  You know, all these guys are doing this because they're really afraid of being in the  thrall of the music industry because they could pull the plug anytime.  It's just like Netflix creating its own content.  Audible's been talking to podcasters and other content creators.  I think they're talking to the music industry.  I think they're talking to the music industry.  Audible's been talking to podcasters and other content creators.  I think they've hired some people from PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they hired some major, major content executives, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NPR, not PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yet another podcast store or directory or place to subscribe.  Like, I want to see more stuff.  I want when I'm listening to a podcast, I want the link that they're talking about.  Oh, yeah.  Come up and auto load.  I want transcripts.  I want the ability to annotate, to share.  I want where I've listened up to to sync across all my devices.  I want to know what episodes I've listened to and for it to tell me automatically,  like, what's next?  And when I want a deep link into a podcast.  Yeah, deep link into a podcast.  When I express interest, I want the Google Now for like, I was interested in Ronda Rousey.  Here are the top five episodes from all these different shows that I should listen to or  whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, like, now on tap feature would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now on tap feature.  Yeah, like, this is a show I should listen to because this was the topic of the show,  or this is the thing that the, you know, I think people make such good points.  There are such great moments in so many different shows, but there's just so much out there.  And I also think there's a lot of room for innovation in clients as well.  You know, I love podcast.  They do a great job.  I still I still find myself like this feeling like this could be so much easier.  And it's interesting that Google hasn't, you know, really tried yet.  So I'm wondering, is this it or is this?  I assume this is just like Google Play is going to list podcast and you can subscribe to them  there just like music.  And it would be similar to iTunes offering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think from this description, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.  You know, you've just invented a company you should start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll call it ODO.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  That worked out okay, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'll see where Twitter lands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it's unknown.  ODO was Ev Williams's company before he pivoted dramatically into and he did podcasts.  ODO was right about the same time as I was starting up in Twitter.  And I was very we were on the ODO directory.  That's right.  That's right.  So I don't have it yet.  It's six point three.  I only have six point two.  So when you get your update, you can see.  So I can't I'm only basing this on what others have published online because Lisa won't show me.  But I guess our stuff will be there.  I guess the reason that we are familiar with it is because they wanted us files and stuff  for testing and so forth.  No doubt.  They'll be there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're everywhere you want to be.  We're a profligate.  Profligate.  That's a nice way to put it.  Promiscuous would be another way.  Well, we'll look for it.  And yeah, you should be getting the update pretty soon.  It's rolling out slowly.  I've been waiting for this update on Hangouts and I still haven't got it.  I'm very nervous about what Google's going to do with Hangouts.  They've apparently decided to move everybody to messages.  The messaging for SMS.  I'm on Google Fi too, which means I'd probably be forced to sooner than others,  but I still don't have the new Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Over the last week, I've noticed some drops in messages on my Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I tried to change my default to Messenger as Google had recommended.  Yeah.  All the texts continue to go to Hangouts, so I don't know what's wrong.  It's going to be a rocky, a bumpy ride, I think.  This is probably preparatory to either phasing out Hangouts or constraining it  to be what it was originally, which is for video calls and Hangouts.  I love Gazelle.  It's just in time for the slew of new phones and devices coming.  Of course, Mobile World Congress is coming up.  We're going to learn about the Galaxy S7 on February 21st.  Yes, we'll broadcast that live.  Of course, you know what that means.  As soon as the new one comes out, your old one starts losing value.  So now, today is the time to go to gazelle.com  and get the quote for what your old device is worth and lock it in.  They don't lock you in.  You lock them in for 30 days.  They promise you they will pay you at least that much for 30 days.  Just go to gazelle.com, find your device, get an instant quote.  Shipping is free.  They'll send you a box.  Payment is fast.  And they buy all sorts of stuff.  Now, here's the interesting thing.  They also sell.  So if you're looking to buy a certified pre-owned device,  turns out just kind of a side effect of their business.  They have a good number of nice iPhones to choose from,  including the iPhone 6S and the 6S Plus, iPads of all varieties,  even Samsung Galaxy phones.  Every device Gazelle sells is fully inspected.  Backed by a 30-day return policy.  And of course, even though they work with all the major carriers,  they are sold without carrier contract.  Gazelle.com.  They're now providing financing too on all devices.  This is a firm.  You're probably familiar with this company.  You just give them some very simple information.  You get instantly approved and you pay off in three, six, or 12 months.  This is a nice way to do it.  Easy monthly payments.  They'll set it up so you can do it with check.  But you can also use bank transfer, wireless transfers, or a debit card.  Just select financing with a firm at checkout.  They are now doing a 12-month warranty as well.  So you have a 30-day return policy,  but you can also buy a one-year warranty on cell phones and iPads.  This is they're using assurance solutions that covers water damage, cracked screens.  Wish I had this for my kids.  Hardware defects and more.  And now they've got 24-7 help.  Round-the-clock help to process claims and return your device fast.  Don't miss out on getting the best value on certified pre-owned devices.  Gazelle.  They're just getting better and better and better all the time.  And thanks to Gazelle, so are your devices.  Gazelle.com.  We're talking about the internet, the Google, the Facebook.  Gina Tripani, I know you only have a few more minutes.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I can go about 10 more minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Babysitter's going home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a dinner to get to.  Oh, good.  That's better.  Babysitter's going home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's better.  I like that better.  Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got nothing to do.  I got nowhere to go.  I can be here all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You and I just gas on and on.  I like this.  Google's giving free gigabyte internet to public housing residents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is nice.  It's having an impact on their cost, but it's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess they have to wire it up and stuff.  Here's a picture of the president with Eric Schmidt as part of this.  During the call on Monday, Alphabet's CFO,  it's so hard to get used to calling him Alphabet,  told investors that even though it's expensive to put that fiber service in,  they're working with the Obama Housing Department to set up public housing residents  with gigabyte connections free of charge.  That's a great way to get people jobs, to get them back in the world,  to help kids learn.  That's how you break the cycle of poverty is just stuff like that.  It makes a huge, huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So while T-Mobile is blocking internet access,  Google between their drones and their public housing projects  are trying to get more people online.  Of course, this is in Google's interest as well.  The more people that are online, the more Google benefits.  This is a win-win for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the first time they've been in the White House.  In January, they were there when the government announced  a $4 billion budget for autonomous vehicles.  One hand washes the other.  No, I think that's playing fair.  This one's a little weird.  Apple, until recently when you searched for abortion,  was pointing you towards adoption sites.  Apparently a bug, not intentionally.  Google is pointing extremist searches towards anti-radicalization websites.  I think that may just be in the UK.  This is intentional in the UK.  It's a pilot scheme.  Facebook and Twitter and Google are under, of course, the microscope  because of widespread use by extremists to radicalize people  and to organize and to even plan attacks.  I like this.  This is a pilot program.  They want to make sure that counter-radicalization videos  are more discoverable on YouTube and even offered  when people search for things like, well, I don't even want to say hummus.  That's not true.  I made that up.  Not the story, just the word hummus.  This is interesting.  From Jessica Lesson at the information, I subscribed so I was able to read it.  Some of you may have seen synopses in other journals.  In fact, did you like this?  Wait, I got to go back.  The link that you just used came from a private email  sent to Business Insider and has already been used to view the full text of the article.  I saw that.  If you're a subscriber, please log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So hide my login because I, of course, pay the $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to support these kinds of initiatives and I think the information is fantastic.  Does that mean I can't show the article?  The video you're watching has been stolen from this article.  It's Amir Afrati who has great contacts inside Google.  But this matches a little bit what I think Apple is doing with the iPhone as well.  Google is no longer going to make it kind of the LG makes the phone or Huawei or HTC  under strict guidance from Google.  Apparently, these things are not going to be made public.  Under strict guidance from Google.  Apparently, these companies set up inside of Google when they're making the Nexus 6P.  They set up inside Google.  So it is kind of a very tight collaboration.  But it's apparently going to go move, in fact, in the direction of Apple-style manufacture.  Google designs and manufactures it with people like Foxconn  or maybe takes LG and Samsung and turns them into Foxconn-like partners.  And so this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how is that different than what they do now?  They're just going to more tightly be involved with the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I mean, I don't know if you make the 6P, if Huawei makes the 6P, how much?  I mean, at least Huawei's name is on it.  You know, we know that it's a Huawei device.  So that wouldn't be the case in future.  Although it wouldn't be hard to find out.  We know Foxconn, for instance, makes iPhones.  Right.  But it says Huawei right at the bottom of the 6P.  I think that probably is to reassure people that, oh, well, it's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess the way this works is that these companies kind of pitch Google  on various handset designs, then Google chooses one and then it works with them.  And so the way that this new method would go is that Google actually  just designs everything in-house.  I love that.  I love that.  I mean, I always look to the Nexus line as like the definitive reference phone,  Google's idea of like the ideal scenario for Android, right?  And so I want the best that Google can come out with.  And I don't want to feel like, well, Huawei's not so great or LG's, you know, whatever.  I want it to be the definitive best up-to-date Android experience,  hardware experience.  So I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes me a little sad about Motorola because I'm sure one of the reasons  Google divested Motorola is because they wanted to make sure that companies  that were making Android wouldn't feel like they were competing,  like, or Motorola had some special inside information.  They were always extremely careful to do that.  But if you're going to make your own phones, don't you wish you had Motorola back?  Think, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and everything else that included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what?  What else did they include that they didn't want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Making all kinds of other phones.  That's the problem.  For Motorola to be a viable business, you have to make a large range of phones.  Okay.  If all you want to make is the reference.  All right.  You're right.  But still that expertise.  Yeah, true.  What does that do to Android partners?  Do they get, you know, Google then is fully a competitor.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's, yes, isn't that interesting?  Yeah.  I want this mirror.  Max Braun, Google engineer.  Built a smart mirror.  They had these on the cruise ship I was on, except it's for the robot bartenders.  It was like a one-way mirror device that would project information on the mirror  about what drink was being made.  But in his bathroom, it gives you weather and news and the time and date.  Isn't that cool?  A smart connected mirror.  I would like to get the plans for this, Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got like an Amazon fire stick plugged in with an APK.  He compiled an APK and then he bought the display.  It's really cool, the project.  Although I got to tell you, I have a smart mirror.  It's my phone.  It's not a mirror.  It's just like the home screen of my phone.  It's kind of like, do I really need a smart bathroom mirror?  No.  But it's pretty cool that he was able to achieve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my mirror fogs up every morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  This would not be good if it fogged up.  I think this is an example of displays you might see all over the house,  which are it's kind of almost augmented reality on a display.  So the display is doing what it does,  but there's an overlay that gives you additional information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seeing news headlines all over my house would really stress me out.  But the weather and time is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does say you don't want to actually look inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, there are the plans right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  Board from China that converts anything in the universe to a 40-pin display cable.  Only using it for HDMI.  These wires seem excessive.  Green LED.  Glows green.  Again with the wires.  And what is this?  I can't even.  By the way, I think this is Max's own annotation.  But it's based on an Android TV Fire TV stick.  That's cool.  Amazon, I should say.  That's really cool.  I like this kind of stuff.  Gina, I know we got to let you go.  I hate to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to give us a quick tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do that.  Oh man, I can't believe I'm going back to politics.  But if you search for a presidential candidate  and you want to know how they stand on the various issues,  you can, Google has now incorporated this into their knowledge graph,  right into the search results.  So say if you search for Hillary Clinton issue stances,  you will find out what all the things she said about immigration  and guns and economics and healthcare.  And you can do that for any presidential candidate.  And you can also search by issues.  So you can say Donald Trump, immigration.  And you'll see what, you know, hit the various quotes,  things that he said his stances on the issues.  Civil liberties, foreign policy.  I'm glad they did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that this is helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a really nice interface.  Pretty easy to read and click through.  It's pretty great.  I mean, it's just sound bites from various news articles,  but very informative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mentioned Instagram.  Are you following this new series?  I haven't seen it yet that they're debuting.  Instagram is debuting an original video series in 15-second clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is going to be cool.  I have not seen it yet, but I'm going to enjoy it.  I'm looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It follows-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like the short video format, I think, is really, really interesting.  I think this has a lot of potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  28 episodes, total of seven minutes, because it's 15-minute clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or 15 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, 15.  I keep saying minutes, because it seems like seconds is hardly enough.  How do you find it?  I guess you'd have to follow.  It's called Shield 5.  Let me just search and see if there's a Shield 5 account.  Or maybe it's going to, you know what?  I bet it's going to be in there where they put the ads.  On Instagram, every 10 posts is an ad.  There is a Shield 5 account.  Oh, all right.  Spelled out F-I-V-E.  I wonder if somebody just opportunistically created that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's throughout February at 5 PM.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it hasn't-  Okay.  Well, where do I watch the first episode?  Oh, last Monday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  It's Shield 5.  It's spelled out.  The 5 is spelled out.  The 5 is spelled out.  Yeah, I see two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Shield 5, one word.  5 spelled out.  Only 15,000 followers.  A serialized thriller to be broadcast exclusively on Instagram.  New episodes throughout February 5 PM Greenwich Mean Time.  I'm watching it now.  Wow.  Well, we could watch it on the-  Well, let's watch it together while we let Gina go.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Thank you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.  Bye, Gina.  Always good to see you.  Yeah, it's good to see you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I don't care if you want to come on for five minutes, you're always welcome.  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you so much, you guys.  We'll shut up.  Yeah, next time we won't talk.  We'll make you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Jeff, we'll talk about it.  I'll definitely come into the new studio.  I want to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Gina.  Have a great day.  Thinkup.com, makerbase.co.  Yes.  Gina Trapani.  See you later, Gina.  See you later.  Here it is, Shield 5.  So should we start at the beginning?  We should start at the beginning, right?  You can figure out which one is the beginning.  The first one.  Here you go.  You ready?  Watch, everybody.  London.  A man walks down a street.  Saturday.  Oh my gosh, he's bloodied.  Was he shot?  Things are getting blurry.  And guess what?  Your 15 seconds is up.  Over.  He does fall to the ground.  Okay, let's go to number two.  Episode one, John Swift.  It looks like there might be nudity in this next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just kidding.  I doubt it very much.  Chris came running over eight days earlier.  His wife's in bed or some woman, a woman.  Maybe his wife in bed.  We'll find out enough for now.  He has a British accent.  She's cuddling, red covers, and probably not wearing any clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus.  Story interrupts us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think anyone's going to know?  What do you think that means?  We'll find out in a minute.  Now we, but see in between, so it's kind of fun because it's a mystery.  In between you get clues.  You see this police appeal for assistance, murder and armed robbery.  Have you seen John Swift?  Detectives are looking for him in connection with an armed robbery and murder.  Now maybe we know why his shirt was bloodied, right?  And then after this segment, we just saw staff directory.  Oh, they work together.  He's a driver.  She's office manager.  What else can we determine from this?  He was born in 1919 and so was she.  Or maybe they just cut off the other part of the year.  Okay, next one.  You ready?  One more.  I guess we've missed a lot of this.  Here's episode three of Shield 5, The Job.  SVC security offices, whopping London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in Shield 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks.  Thought we were in 9.  I changed it to 5.  Is that a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were Shield 9.  Now there's Shield 5.  Thanks.  Is it comedy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thought we were in 9.  I changed it to 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The nice thing, you can watch it over and over and over.  Still don't know what's going on.  You're not supposed to.  That would be exposition.  Hair women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too much Louis C.K.'s new show?  No.  Is it good?  Phenomenal.  He did it again.  He just started a whole new series.  Five bucks, download it, do what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a series though, this time.  It's not a comedy show.  It's a series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a series and it's an unbelievable cast.  It's a drama with comedy moments in it.  Alan Alda is the time of his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called Horace and Pet.  Pete.  I could cut off the E.  And where do we get it?  Do we have to go to louisck.net?  Yeah, we do.  Horace and Pete's.  Includes one video episode.  Latest release.  Oh man, is he smart.  You know what?  The new thing.  That's the new thing.  I just declared it.  Bypassing Netflix and going straight to the viewers.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much?  And it is so five bucks.  For one episode?  Which for one show is actually a lot.  That's an awful lot.  You get $1.99 or $2.99.  It's worth it.  I don't get the series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there no series?  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just dropped one episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, you have to be a fan to buy that for five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I am and it's good.  So Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, Jessica Lange, Rebecca Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, it's five bucks.  And you get 67 minutes.  It's not like a 15 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As it says here, it's like a Eugene O'Neill.  This is Hollywood Reporter.  It starts as a Eugene O'Neill play about two brothers running a struggling joint,  transitions into a David Mamet drama about political correctness  and generational definitions of masculinity,  becomes a Norman Lear sitcom about contemporary political attitudes,  pivots into a Chekhov saga about an underestimated woman reclaiming her birth rate,  and settles into a Mike Lee kitchen sink dramedy about painful blue collar family revelations.  I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not Kickstarter.  This is on Louis' site.  This is on Louis' site.  It says, buy now.  To buy this thing, do this.  Enter your email.  We will not bother you.  Choose below to pay with PayPal, Amazon, D'Walla, or Bitpay.  Three, watch the show, download the show, ignore the show, whatever you want.  After that, you never ever have to hear from me again unless you want to.  And then there's a checkbox that says,  yes, I'd like to receive further emails about Louis CK things.  No, leave me alone forever.  Yes.  No, leave me alone forever.  You fat idiot is the other choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, when I forgot my password, even the password thing is funny.  Gosh, I am amazed.  What's amazing too, Leo, is that there are current lines in here  that show that it must have been taped like two days before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think he paid the other actors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was talking to a friend of mine who really knows TV today,  and he said, I see you got Alan Alde.  He goes, yeah, it's Louis CK.  Right.  Louis CK is the Woody Allen of our time.  Wow.  He's the auteur who does amazing things,  and you watch whatever the heck he does.  He has to at least pay them scale.  Yeah, I don't know.  Can you do a…

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe because it's the internet, you could say, well, it's experimental video.  No, I think not.  I think he has to pay them scale.  But even so…  And you know what?  You might work for scale on something like this just to see.  Oh, God, you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, these people absolutely would.  That's all they'd get.  Hang out with Louis.  I'm telling you, all Buscemi and Alde and Edie Falco who are the main leads in here.  Plus, it's…  Oh, what's Stephen Wright?  Oh, man.  It can be used at the end of the bar where he should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I can imagine.  I'd like to go to a bar where Stephen Wright's sitting at the end,  just making comments.  You can download it.  They have three sizes, 1080p, 720p, 480p.  Or you can stream it on your computer or your phone.  I'm going to download it, though.  It's an hour or seven.  Yeah, no, it's a big thing.  It's 1.7 gig in high def.  I probably shouldn't download it right now.  Also…  During the show.  But that's cool.  All right.  We got to wrap this up.  Let me just do a couple of quick…

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to do that.  I wanted to ask you about some Facebook things in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter.  We talked about Twitter on Sunday and Jason Calacanis was convinced  it was in play.  He says, I said, who's going to buy it?  Is it investment companies trying to turn it and make a quick buck?  Or is it a company like Google that says it'll synergize with their business?  He says it's both.  He implied that he knew of at least one offer.  And then, of course, the very next day,  there was a Twitter stock soared  because Business Insider published a story saying,  Mark Andreessen and Silver Lake considered buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And wouldn't that be the best thing in the world?  Mark Andreessen who?  Who really understands Twitter?  That was a Jessica Lesson story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should give Jessica credit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Andreessen knows Twitter,  understands Twitter, loves Twitter.  For him to own Twitter would be phenomenal.  I'd love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love it.  But apparently, they did not, in fact, they decided not to.  No.  She says, I don't know if anything is active in a spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz  and Silver Lake decided to decline to comment.  But she thought it might be a pipe deal.  Private investors buy a piece of a public stock via newly issued shares.  I don't think Twitter's, that's usually done to raise funds quick.  Twitter's not short on funds.  They're actually doing quite well,  even though their stock is not doing well.  In fact, one of the stories going around is that people are very careful right now about  Twitter because they don't want it to look like a hostile takeover,  even though Twitter's failing stock price makes that possible.  Right.  Apple?  We thought, Calacanis mentioned Disney,  a media company like Disney would probably be a logical  buyer.  I don't know.  Twitter surges on another stock.  What's the market cap now?  It's not cheap, but it's not super expensive.  It was around 20 or 30 billion.  Let me just real quickly check here.  TWTR, right?  10.98 billion.  Oh, not much.  11 billion dollars.  You got 11 billion?  Let me check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa, what can we put together?  Checkbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can heavily leverage it.  I got a couple hundred bucks here.  So yeah, I would like Marc Andreessen.  Certainly there's nobody who better understands the power of Twitter.  He invented the tweet storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  He turned Skype, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Andreessen Horowitz own Skype?  With Silverlake, didn't they?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Microsoft just bought one of our fan.  I'm sorry, Gina's not here because I'm sure she's a SwiftKey fan.  SwiftKey, which is the best Android keyboard, third party keyboard, is also available on iOS.  Microsoft has, in fact, just started offering on iOS a similar keyboard.  They call their flow.  Is it flow word flow?  And so they've acquired.  I hope they don't hurt it.  Do you use SwiftKey?  Do you know about SwiftKey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like a plain old keyboard.  I can't do that.  The Google keyboard does that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know and I can't stand it.  I don't do that.  I love it.  And the Google keyboard now is in many ways almost as good as SwiftKey.  The thing that makes SwiftKey special is it looks at all your other writings  with your permission and improves its predictions based on your Facebooks,  your tweets, your emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even use predictions because then I've got to stop typing and look at the predictions,  say yes or no, and hit that.  I just keep typing and making mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing SwiftKey does that's really cool is it tells you how many miles you flowed.  Let me see if I think I have SwiftKey on this.  This is the Nexus 6P.  I might be using the Google keyboard has gotten pretty darn good.  Let me let me.  Oops.  I forgot how to use Android.  It's been so long.  There you go.  That's the video of SwiftKey.  See, I like that flow.  They didn't invent it.  Swipe invented it.  But then they swiped it from Swipe.  The swipe still around?  Yeah.  S-W-Y-P-E.  Where's my SwiftKey?  Maybe I...  Oh yeah, there it is.  I have the beta.  That's right.  So I am 7% more efficient.  I saved 198 taps.  They predicted 11 words.  It gives you graphs and...  And it tells you what words you type a lot,  the top emoji you've used,  the size of your vocabulary.  I have flowed 131 words for 11.28 meters.  I must have just installed on this phone because it's not...  But see, that kind of stats really people love.  I don't know if it's valuable, but they love it.  Speaking of acquisitions,  Zag, which is a nice smartphone battery case manufacturer,  has purchased Mophie, which is a very nice battery case.  Zag also makes good keyboards.  Oh yeah, the Zag keyboard.  Yeah.  $100 million.  Oh, I didn't mention that no one knows what SwiftKey went for,  but the thinking is Microsoft paid a quarter of a billion dollars for it.  $250 million.  Not bad.  Nice work if you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's all of our big stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two Facebook things, I'm sorry.  Oh yes, you were going to do those, yes.  So the one story is that they're using qualitative feedback  to change the newsfeed based on surveys of people who say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead of just doing it automatically,  which they've been doing up to now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but they've obviously used some behavior to...  Yeah, they're monitoring you.  ...judge that.  But now they've also asked people...  Now they're asking you.  Please tell us, they've asked us a panel,  please tell us what you want to see in your feed  and don't want to see in your feed,  and they're learning whatever lessons they learn from that.  And so they try to go to quality, which is kind of interesting.  Oh, do you want this in your feed?  Do you want it on the top?  What would you do with this?  So I found that interesting.  Then also they announced audience optimization for publishers.  Oh, what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you might be interested in that's why I brought it up.  Yeah, so that...  Well, I've known this for a while that you can tell Facebook...  Who was it?  Oh, it was actually again, Jason Calacanis.  He tells me a lot of things I don't know.  I'm slumping.  You don't have to adjust the camera.  Running over to move the camera.  He told...  Yeah, no, maybe I'm not slumping.  I'll sit up even higher.  There we go.  He told me that if the really sharp people are using Facebook,  will work with Facebook to target their articles to...  Let's say he said what you could do with Twitter is to have the Twitter newsletter.  I don't do any of this.  In fact, I promised on the show I would never do this.  When he said it, he said, you should be doing this and improve your...  I said, I promise I will never do this.  But we could take the newsletter, which we have, twitter.tv slash newsletter.  We could take that information and then feed it to Facebook.  Here's all the people who subscribe.  And then they would generate things like a demographic set  based on that of like-minded people who don't watch Twitter.  And then I could make sure that the Twitter video for a fee  gets pushed to those people because indications are they would like it  because these people like it.  You see what I'm saying?  It's basically advertising.  They also say if you use tags, we can do some of this for free.  But I think really this is open to having the conversation of,  well, you really want this to work.  What we need to do is work closely together.  But they say you could use tags.  I think any signal that you give Facebook, they're happy to get, right?  Yeah.  See, I think the qualitative feedback is the same thing.  They love data, just more data.  One thing I know is that you don't really want to ask people what they like because they lie.  They lie worse than a Trump voter in Iowa.  They are Trump non-voter in Iowa.  We know when you ask people what kind of TV they watch, they all say PBS.  And nobody really watches it.  They're always trying to impress the survey taker.  Oh, yes, I watch a lot of Downton Abbey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I was at People magazine, we did cover tests.  You put Diane Sawyer gives you the news or Brooke Shields in a bikini.  I'm going to buy Diane Sawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best cover test is to put, which a lot of companies now do,  is put both covers on an actual newsstand and then see which one sells.  Because people don't lie with their dollars, they lie with their tongues.  Yep.  According to CNBC, the IRS is experiencing computer failure across several systems.  Just thought you'd like to know.  A little schadenfreude there.  Dr. Mom put that in the chat room and said, tell Jeff there is a God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she pays taxes.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube is also doing original content.  The first is going to appear for people who are red subscribers next week.  It's called A Trip to Unicorn Island.

Happiness is the only thing worth fighting for.  Is Lilly Singh a real person?  Oh yes, as a matter of fact, she's a real person.  She's a YouTube star.  How about this one?  Dance Cap.  Camp.  Not cap, camp.  Dance Camp.  This feature film from Awesomeness TV weaves an amazing story of unlikely  friendships unleashing passions discovering yourself through the power of dance.  Awesomeness TV.  YouTube partner.  Laser Team.  In this feature-length action comedy from Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen Films,  four small town losers stumble upon an alien ship carrying mysterious cargo  leading to a battle to save Earth from an all-powerful enemy.  And finally, here we go.  Is this the...  Go ahead, play the audio on this.  Oh man, I don't want to see this.  Oh lord.  Oh, it's Nick for Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And finally, Scare PewDiePie.  In this reality adventure series from the creator and executive producer of The Walking  Dead at Skybound Entertainment at Maker Studios, experience thrills, chills, and laughter  as PewDiePie encounters terrifying situations inspired by his favorite video games.  That's going to be a hit, huge hit, because it's PewDiePie.  And they're simulating computer games.  Oh god.  It's not for us, Jeff.  No, it's not.  Not at all.  I just think the world is conspiring to make me feel old.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Vice announced its channel.  Yeah.  It's an old-time TV channel today.  Yeah.  Viceland.  Viceland.  Mike Jones and Eddie Morady as co-presidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the odds that they will have young women bouncing on trampolines in at least  one of those shows?  I know.  I know.  I'm glad Spike is back, baby.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Trevally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Viceland.  Actually, I just saw people bouncing on a trampoline in the trailer.  Okay.  So I wasn't wrong.  No, really?  Alright.  Let's take a break and come back with our tips and tools and numbers of the week.  We already got Gina's tips.  So it's up to you and me to keep the troops entertained.  But first, a word from Fresh Books.  I love Fresh Books.  If you're a freelancer, you do your own invoices.  Maybe you're a small business.  I don't, I think I can read your mind.  You don't really love that time of the month, right?  When you, that's my time of the month.  I have to sit down and get all the expenses out of the shoe box and add them all up.  And I have to figure out how many hours I worked on every project.  Then I have to create an invoice and send it.  And by the time you get to the end of the month,  let me get back to the thing I love, the reason I created my business.  Fresh Books is going to make it so simple, so easy.  It's better than having an accounting manager.  It's like, it's like, it's the best stuff.  First of all, there's the Fresh Books app, which keeps track of your expenses.  You just take a picture of them and then gets it right into the invoice.  The invoices look super.  They're very easy.  In fact, really, you can almost automatically create the invoice with the push of a button.  And then the nice thing is that invoice goes out and you get paid faster,  on average, five days faster because it's easy for your client.  They just push a pay button and they can pay online.  Time and hours, no problem.  Use the app.  It automatically keeps track of it and then puts it into your invoice.  Plus, if you are in a business where you go to people's houses,  their new Fresh Books app lets you create an estimate on your iPhone,  show it to your client, get approval, do the work,  show the invoice to the client, and then you stick their new EMV Cap Capable Card Reader  in your phone.  They can swipe the stripe or dip the chip and pay you on the spot.  You're gonna love it.  This redesigned iPhone app is amazing.  Send an estimate right after the handshake, send an invoice in seconds,  right from your phone.  This is how your customers want to work with you.  You could track all your billable time anywhere you are.  You could track expenses with your iPhone camera.  And of course, if you have any questions,  support is always free and always there.  The support rock stars at Fresh Books go above and beyond to help you out.  I love Fresh Books.  Used it for years.  I want you to use it for 30 days free.  Go to freshbooks.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Bloomberg Dadfly, which is a service I didn't know existed, is very good.  It's well named.  What is it?  It is.  It's financial stuff.  They do some really interesting analyses using data visualizations.  And because both Amazon and Alphabet are reporting more details of their companies,  they put them together and saw what we saw, which I found really interesting.  So some of the obvious we know is revenue.  On Amazon, the retail revenue is 99 billion,  which of course cheats because that includes the merchandise.  AWS is $7.8 billion revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually huge even though it looks dwarfed by the retail.  Exactly.  It's a good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google $74.5 billion and the other bets are 0.5, half a billion.  Profit.  Amazon of course keeps profit as tiny as it can to not get,  as somebody I know said in an article, to not get Wall Street addicted to that crack.  So it's 2.7 billion profit on retail and 1.9 billion profit on AWS.  So they let that go ahead and make it profitable.  Google $23 billion profit and of course, as we said earlier on the show,  negative $3.6 billion on the other bets.  Operating margin, 3% on retail for Amazon, 24% for AWS at Amazon, 31% for Google.  Free cash flow, CapEx, what else was there?  Total debt, $17.5 billion at Amazon and $5.2 billion at Google.  One wonders why Google even has debt but that's the way they operate.  So I just found those somewhat interesting.  Now that we can know a little bit more about the companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is a nice page.  Gadfly's very good, yeah.  It's Bloomberg.com slash Gadfly.  They're doing really neat stuff at Bloomberg Media.  It's kind of a funny name because it isn't a Gadfly kind of dilettante.  City, I know.  I don't know why it is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they have neat analyses.  Love it.  Amazon's bookish demeanor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you considered, I know, as a number, the number $6,006.13.  And now I feel punked by this.  So I thought this was a great story.  You remember in September, a fella named Sanmay Ved bought Google.com.  He had gone to the new Google domains and just as a lark said,  I wonder if I could buy Google.com and to his surprise, got it.  We reported that when it happened and it got turned back on.  Now we find out that in fact, Google, instead of going through the lengthy  I can process of getting their name back, just said, hey, Sanmay, can we give you some money?  How about let's give you a Google dollars.  That's G-O-O-G-L-E or $6,006.13.  Get it? And leet.  Somebody pointed out that's also booby, but that's  Google or booby, either way.  Then Sanmay said, no, but I got a better deal for you.  I'll give it to charity if you double it.  And they did $12,012.26.  So I got, I thought this was really good.  This is a blog post and this came on Thursday and it came from,  you know, the bounty bug bounty program.  A vet donated it to the art of living India foundation, a humanitarian and educational NGO.  But what they told me on a tweet on Sunday is, oh, did you know,  Ved used to work at Google.  You've been punked.  The whole thing is a PR ploy.  I don't know if that's true or not.  No, he's a student now.  Yeah.  He's studying at Babson college.  He was an account for five years, an account strategist at Google from 2007 to 2012.  I don't see how that presumes.  Okay, good.  You're the hard nose journalism professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm an optimist.  I'm an optimist.  Have a little faith in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I want you to do this as a case study for your students.  What do they think?  I don't know.  Speaking of case studies, you saw,  I'm kind of very sad that the intercept had to fire.  Yep.  A reporter and retract many of his stories because he fabricated them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Made up quotes people he didn't talk to.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad apples.  You know, it happens everywhere.  The New York Times had the same problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ever.  I saw press release past my email that Jason Blair, who was the New York Times case,  was commenting on the intercept.  Oh, please.  I really cared.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, when you're going to fabricate a source,  actually, this guy at the intercept had probably learned a little from Jason because  he faked emails.  He created a fake email account.  He sent himself the quotes so he could say, no, see, I have the email right here.  I mean, he was pretty sophisticated in his subterfuge.  You're going to go to all that effort.  Well, the problem with it, it's a smoking gun now.  Yeah.  You know, that's the, so the next guy won't do that.  Yeah.  A word of warning to whoever hires.  The next guy.  I just want to give you, I don't have a product.  I do want to give you an update on the Tesla because it was last week, I think,  or maybe two weeks ago, I mentioned that I was having difficulty working with Tesla  and finding, getting a date.  And then the next day I got a call from somebody very nice at Tesla who said,  oh, I heard the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when I hang my head and no car for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he didn't do what they did to Stuart.  Stuart Alsop was a well-known columnist tech guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if Elon had seen the podcast, he may not have a car now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Apparently Alsop wrote a stinging blog piece or a medium piece on how he,  as a Model X customer, because he had pre-ordered one,  went to the Model X event, had to wait two hours for Elon to take the stage  and never ever, and after three hours, it ended up not seeing  hide or hair of a Model X.  He went away disappointed and he wrote a note on medium in public to Elon saying,  this is terrible.  And Elon apparently just canceled his order.  I love you, Elon.  You're great.  I'm excited.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, well, here's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got a date and it's February or March of like next month.  No, you're kidding me.  Yeah.  So I thank you.  Once I understood that I had the wrong expectations.  I had the expectation was like going to a car dealer and buying a car.  And then they say, yo, you'll have your car in it.  But this is a brand new vehicle nobody's ever made.  They're just now ramping up.  They're making apparently 238 cars a week.  It's not, you know, but for whatever reason,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think I'm jumping the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope I'm not because I don't like to do that.  But my car, they call it.  Did you order?  I ended up getting a titanium.  It's all right.  What interior?  A tan.  So we talked about this because I really wanted a white pearl white with a white inside  because I'd seen videos of that.  In fact, I think Elan's is that.  And I thought that looks like a car from the future.  And since I'm driving a car from the future, it should look like a car from the future.  It should look like a car from the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Jason said earlier, there was a good stormtrooper look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does look a little bit like a stormtrooper.  But my wife, wiser had prevailed.  And you had the same reaction as my wife.  Oh, immediately.  Immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll get just get dirty.  I used to eat salt bagels all the time.  My family just got enraged how there was salt in the car because I'd rip them up in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like poppy seed, which would be even worse for a white car.  Little black specks everywhere.  Anyway, I apologize.  I'm very excited.  Now I have to talk Lisa into letting me get it early  because we were going to wait till September when my lease runs out.  But don't you think I should have it sooner so that I can review it and talk about it?  Oh, yes, Leo, you should.  Thank you, Jeff.  This is kind of what I said.  I said, Lisa, I love you.  You can send me the nature box card later.  Do you think I'm?  Yes, exactly.  Do you think it would be OK if we took delivery of this a little bit early?  So what are you asking me for?  You know you're going to do whatever you want.  People are buying electric cars and I think it's so cool.  I got solar panels on the roof just to do that.  30 kilowatt hours a day we're generating.  And so that when I drive this car, I could say this car is powered by the sun almost directly  and is using no renewable resources except for.  Just on principle, I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, plus the only electric car I've driven was I test drove the I3, the BMW.  And, you know, as I said at the time.  Made with wind, you know.  Yes, exactly.  And it goes like the wind.  Oh, yeah, electric's amazing.  It's it's the electric's amazing because it's like it's like a nuclear powered golf cart.  You know, it's wonderful.  It's derived so differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm I'm pretty excited.  I don't know yet.  Oh, I'd be I'd be dying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now what do you think about the Model 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is according to Jason Calacanis, this is like the eighth time I've quoted him in this show.  This is scary me.  Who is a friend of Elon Musk's and claims to be privy to Elon's strategic thinking.  He also owns the number one roadster at the Roadster Model number one.  And also, he says that really this has all been a journey to get to the Model 3.  Yes, the consumer.  Thirty thousand dollar consumer grade electric car because Elon's not in this for the money,  isn't it?  To change the world.  And the reason this came up is because we were talking about Apple's ambitions  in autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles.  And Jason's pretty sure Apple has serious designs on Tesla.  He's just as sure that Elon does not want to sell because he's not in it for the money.  He's changing the world.  He's he's really in it more to change the world and make the money.  But he said maybe he wants to get to the Model 3.  Maybe after the Model 3, the consumer priced version of this,  which he's been financing with these high expensive Model S and X.  Maybe when we get to the Model 3, he'll be consider selling it then.  And Apple may well, you know, who knows, they may have a memo of understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, by then you may find similar company cars from lots of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Chevy Bolt is a thirty thousand dollar,  two hundred mile range electric car.  That's the key, by the way.  That's the difference between Tesla's and the Leaf and the Volt and all these is range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and to me, the real test is when a car,  when electric car can get as far as you can drive in a day, which is four or five hundred miles.  Right.  Three hundred miles, even, which I think the main Tesla does do.  Right.  Right.  Then it becomes practical.  If I have to stop for 45 minutes in the middle of driving somewhere and find the damn place,  then no.  Right.  Though even then, I still need, you know, it's in Tesla's interest.  This is why he's open source.  Things the more charging stations there are and hotels and parking lots and everywhere,  the better the market is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could probably just turn my Audi in early.  What's the penalty?  I don't know.  I should look.  I mean, there's a penalty, but it can't.  How much could it be?  It's got to be less than having two leases at the same time.  What does Lisa drive?  She drives an Audi also.  We like Audis.  I really love the Audi, but we don't.  We lease the company leases it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I went to visit my parents.  My father's 90th birthday on Saturday, which is very clear.  Happy birthday.  Wow.  Big deal.  So my sister and I went down and I rented a car and I chose the Ford because I said,  oh, good, I'm going to try sync.  Two things.  One, I can't believe they took out the aux plug.  So I really plug in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cars don't have aux plugs.  I don't have an aux plug in my Audi either.  In fact, I don't even have a USB port.  I have a proprietary connection with a 30-pin plug on the other end for your out-of-date iPod.  You can buy additional connectors, which I ended up doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then I said, okay, okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Tesla doesn't have an aux plug either, by the way, but it does have four USB ports.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the standard USB ports.  Yeah.  So I then try to just do Bluetooth.  That's okay.  No, no, no, no.  You have to have the sync app.  It'll only do Bluetooth in the sync app.  So fine.  I download the sync app onto my phone and then no, no, no.  I've got to register with the VIN number and all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It does standard Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't get it to do it.  I couldn't figure out how to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it totally does standard Bluetooth.  Unless they really changed it because I had Ford Sync.  You know, I had a Mustang for years.  I know that.  I know that.  And you just pair it like you do any car.  You search for the phone and it finds it.  Although they didn't have at the time a Bluetooth app, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, somebody will tell me the answer, but the point was I just wanted to try it out  and rental cars are a huge way to try out new products.  Right.  So because I'm debating right now.  You still haven't decided.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you thinking electric?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it just isn't practical.  You're going to go hybrid, right?  I would love to, but that's.  The car that would seem to have everything I want is that Lincoln, but I'm just too young.  I have that same prejudice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for old people.  Jeff, we're the old people we were thinking of.
