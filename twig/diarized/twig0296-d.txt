Public parts?  You don't have to hold them all up. Geeks bearing news? Gifts?  I always want to say news, but it's gifts.  Save Thig at Gutenberg the Geek.  Thank you for being here, Jeff.  Thank you.  Love that. You know who's back and we're so happy to see her.  From ThinkUp.com, it's Gina Trapani.  Great to be here.  Did you do all about Android last night, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't. I haven't been on all about Android in a while, but Jason and I are...  We're her favorite.  We've set up dates. Yes. That will happen soon.  I had this crazy bronchitis, walking pneumonia thing happen,  and I was just laid up for a couple of weeks there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. You feeling okay now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, feeling way, way better. But yeah, it was six days in bed.  I've never been...  Geez.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what winter does to you.  Crazy, crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Socks.  So I didn't get on all about Android this month, but I'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're just thrilled to see you.  Gina, of course, has given up show business for her startup, ThinkUp.  You can see my ThinkUp. I'll log in as me.  But you can see it if you just go to leolaport.thinkup.com,  and you can see what it does for you. It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun.  I miss you guys, but we've been heads down building all kinds of cute new things  I'm really excited about. I can't talk about yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it scare you that Twitter is pulling the plug on the fire?  You're not a firehose consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we're not. We're not. We're a per user.  We're old school. We use the per user REST API,  so we weren't affected by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get it. So they got the whole point of this was these are companies that  can you believe, by the way, I spent a lot of energy crafting, hand crafting tweets,  making the best possible tweets.  And then some some weird API goes off.  There's a site called Twitter Counter that's been around for ages.  It's how we used to keep track of who was number one on Twitter back when it was  me versus Kevin Rose.  And I had set up like three weeks ago their email thing so I could email tweets.  Never used it.  And I think something weird happened because all of a sudden I tweeted high comma.  And I'm looking at my Twitter stream lights up.  I'm going, what? Four minutes ago, I tweeted high comma.  No, I'm lying in bed.  So, of course, immediately went down the hall to Michael, the kid and said,  Michael, did you were you on my computer?  He said, no.  And oh, OK, well, I could never figure it out.  Finally, I figured out that it was from Twitter Counter.  They can't figure it out either, but doesn't matter.  High comma was not only the big tweet of the week, the big tweet of the year.  Two hundred fifty replies, four hundred fifty six favorites, a hundred sixty four  people retweeted high comma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's incredible.  We're all going to do it.  Your fans are thirsty for engagement, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  I'm just going to tweet non sequitur greetings every few days and I'll be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny.  I've had people say to me, I read your tweets and I don't know what you're talking about  most of the time.  Maybe that's it.  And I think I think that just happens, you know, when you're passionate about a topic  or when you're talking to folks, you know, you feel like, you know, like the Twig audience,  you know, you know where I'm coming from.  I think you kind of just make assumptions.  So I think when you say something like that, everybody can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a real insight there.  Wow.  And I love your I love the insight that you wrote.  Whatever Leo Laporte said must have been memorable.  I'll never forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that comma was a bug on ThinkObs part, but no, it was high comma.  It was high comma.  It was also really a cliffhanger of a tweet.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Punctuation is central to the.  How many how many buys did you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I get a lot.  The first thing I got was from Jeff Needles, who tweeted there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, see?  He completed it.  Yeah.  People's brains can't can't abide by those kinds of things just hanging there out in space.  It's like unclosed parentheses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's when you're really glad you have think up because you can immediately you know,  this is not stuff that you can easily see, but thinkable surface stuff.  It's also really fun to go back in time and and see, you know,  your big tweets from a year ago and two years ago.  I love that.  That's one of the reasons we subscribe to time hop.  Many of us.  I use 33 exclamation marks or 33 tweets with exclamation marks.  I do like the exclamation mark a little too much.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a love of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish you would do a think up for podcasts and you could say Leo said actually 27 times this week.  Wouldn't that be useful?  Or soul destroy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Soul destroying.  Of every time I said, uh, and I apologize to everyone who's ever listened to Twig because I do that.  And it was just like, kill me now.  Just let me crawl under my desk and never speak again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all have verbal crutches.  Oh, it's not a good verbal crutch.  But no, it's not a good one.  But actually is bad.  There's a lot of bad verbal crutches out there and all of us have some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think NPR just did a piece on no totally as a linguist.  No, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.  Oh, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I hate and I do it all the time?  Yeah, no.  Yeah, no.  And it's like that.  I just said two contradictory things in one sense.  Yeah, no.  I say that a lot.  Google Ventures.  This is this was makes me happy.  Can thank me for one hundred eighty five thousand more people seeing in their tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can include that in your pitch deck when you try to raise a retweet.  I know I'm bigger than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or not.  Or not.  Did you watch?  Did you what?  Did you guys watch Silicon Valley on Sunday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  I did.  I did.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Yeah, you dropped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been working on Jeff.  Jeff left it in protest.  I love that show.  So many.  I love it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know people hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a satire.  It's hilarious.  I think it's funny.  I think it's funny.  Look, some jokes aren't, but it's if you're there's a little too many dick jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that.  And unfortunately, Sunday was really full of them.  But if you're in the scene, you recognize so many things.  And I was just sure and I was wrong, but I was just sure that there were like tons of  venture capitalists, real ones sprinkled through that episode on Sunday.  Definitely.  Because they're out.  The story is that at the end of last season, they won Tech Grunch Disrupt.  And and so Pied Piper, which is this fictional company that's created this new compression  algorithm that's better than any.  What is the stat?  We got Weisman.  We got five on the Weisman scale and nobody's ever done that.  And and there's a Google analog called Hooli.  But so the story this this season begins with them going now out to get their A round of  financing.  And actually, I really you can't spoil it.  Can I spoil a comedy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can spoil it.  I thought it was a great commentary.  So I'm going to you don't have to spoil it.  I'll spoil it.  So the bigger they were in each meeting, like the bigger jerks and like the most dismissive  and condescending that they could be the bigger offers they would get.  And like this is I think this is why the show is so great.  I mean, that's a commentary kind of absolutely on on what sort of behavior gets rewarded  in an industry.  And it's funny because, you know, people say that show is so sexist.  There are no women.  How do you like the show?  It's so sexist.  It's a sat.  It's a commentary.  No, the industry sexist.  It's sexist because it's a commentary on the industry.  And I will point out that one of the few women in the show is like the only competent,  the only nice, intelligent person in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that woman right there?  Yeah, right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it was great.  I loved having been through a less intense and certainly smaller round of fundraising.  I really enjoyed watching those meetings.  It was a good it was a good episode.  Listen, it's a half an hour.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like VEEP a little better, but that's OK, because VP got to watch three times because  the jokes are so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing that I thought was in the real is I'm bringing up.  Yes, they went and they got were able to get insane evaluations.  Finally, the last valuation was that they get what was it?  Fifty million dollars and be for a valuation of 200 million dollars.  That was the top they got.  And then somebody at the smart woman said, you don't want to take that money.  That's death.  You you need to negotiate down.  Because if you take too much money, then there's too much pressure to turn it around and you'll be out of business.  You'll lose your company because you can't live up to that.  You're not worth that.  And I thought that was a I thought actually that was very astute.  Have you experienced that, Jeff?  Ever? I mean, is that is that is that a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, I I I love to tell the story that Nick Denton when I was in the board of his last company, moreover, he he raised a lot of money.  It was in early 2000s.  And when we hit the bus, I said, boy, Nick, the best thing we ever did was raise too much money.  So we you know, we have a safety net.  He said, no, Jarvis, worse than I ever did.  Let the CEO, you know, try things we shouldn't have tried.  Too much money is bad.  Very, very Nick thing to say.  Yeah, yeah, he's yeah, he's extremely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that is.  That is to say he's very bearish on that kind of thing.  I was just reading about I think it's get satisfaction.  Lane Becker's company, they just got sold and he was one of the founders and he didn't make a dime.  It was a fire sale.  His work and when asked, you know, I love Lane Lane, too.  He tweeted very frankly about what happened, but he basically said, you know, we there was a point in the lifetime of the company where we had acquisition offers.  And then we had this, you know, round of fundraising that we could do and we took too much money.  The company wasn't worth it.  So it's exact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this was a prescient Silicon Valley, of course, recorded before this.  But this is prescient.  This is exactly.  Wow.  You know, who's writing for them?  I didn't know this.  Dan Lyons.  So maybe for Silicon Valley, the TV show.  Oh, oh, oh, I didn't realize that.  So maybe Nick told Dan and Dan told them.  I don't know.  Well, it's just Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's it's you know, it is wisdom.  Yeah, I've seen it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but that's the kind of reason I kind of like it because it's actually there's some there's some real reality in all of the comedy.  Yeah, there's a there's an insider knowledge that's going on there.  That's pretty accurate.  And I think maybe some of that does come from Dan Lyons, who was, you know, was the fake Steve Jobs and is a character and a half.  And for five weeks or less was editor chief of Valley Wag and then quit.  And apparently I didn't know this, but because I'd seen it somewhere else.  But then I saw in the credits that he's a contributor.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Lane sold Get Satisfaction.  That's to be Lane is Lane is a really good guy.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Lane.  He'd raised 50 million dollars.  Wait a minute.  50 million dollar valuation.  He had raised 21 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Preferences kill you every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was pushed out of the company in 2010.  Well, it's even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's one matter if you kind of do it to yourself, but then you're powerless.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But boy, you know, I hear that from a lot of entrepreneurs who've been pushed out of their companies.  It's not at all unusual.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost in the script.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a preen up with Lisa says she can't push me out of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not kidding about that, are you?  No, I am kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, I did ask her, you're not going to push me out of the company now that you're married to me.  So he didn't make any money.  It was sold in a so-called fire sale to Sprinkler.  I don't even know who Sprinkler is.  There's an irony there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I felt bad.  I felt bad about this for him.  I told him I'm sorry.  It happened this way.  This is tough.  You know, but like when you're a founder, particularly when you're going out, trying to get funding,  I mean, your job is to sell, is to be as optimistic to the point of absurdity about the possibilities that are within your business.  Right.  So I think, you know, particularly when you get into a bidding war situation, which is basically what they had in the show, which is fictional, of course.  But, you know, more money feels like more success.  That's more staff you can hire.  That's an office.  That's, you know, you can do so many different things.  So it's a tough thing, I think, for a founder at that early stage, especially when a company is basically just an idea to say we're not worth this much.  You know, in the show, he says, can we do that?  Can we ask for less?  Does anybody do that?  Yeah.  But yeah, sometimes it's something to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was right on.  And Lane Becker says, ask for less.  He says, although I thought it was more a game of chess, it's more a game of Thrones.  That's a great line.  Venture capital is a game and we lost.  Poor guy.  Now, of course, the current CEO did fine and the CFO and late stage investors did fine.  But the guy who thought up Get Satisfaction, which is a brilliant idea, got nothing.  So a little less in there.  Ripped straight from the headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And HBO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And HBO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't get your opinion.  You think Silicon Valley is OK, Jeff?  I haven't watched the season yet.  Yeah.  Well, you didn't miss anything.  It's the first episode was Sunday.  So yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm such a habit now of watching everything on my Nexus seven.  I've been flying like crazy.  I was in Copenhagen for 24 hours last week and I'm going to Italy and UK this week.  And so I just stock up on things on my Nexus seven.  And that's how I watch TV now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking that on Sunday because Sunday night, if you were a live TV viewer, was was purgatory  because you had Good Wife, you had a new Good Wife episode, you had a new Mad Men episode, the second in the season, the last, the final season.  And you had Game of Thrones, Veep and Silicon Valley all on the same night and and some against each other.  And that would not I don't think that would have happened quite so readily in the pre VCR on demand.  Had a little bit of that.  But you did it.  But if you did it, you did it on purpose.  You said like, we're going to take that guy down.  Bingo.  Yes.  But you know, it's bad for viewers if they had to and ultimately for you if they had to figure out, well, what do we watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm spending a fortune now buying shows.  Yes, I buy content people.  No, I'm with you.  I mean, I'm like, like Good Wife.  I actually don't want to watch it too fast.  No, I'm saying I know.  I know because you're coming to the end, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not. No, I'm up season three.  Oh, we're on season two.  Good. We're with you.  It is. It's so good.  I just.  But you know what?  It's a mindless show.  It's good.  You can sit there.  You can. You don't have to.  Game of Thrones.  If you miss 30 seconds, I'm like, who's that?  Who are they?  What's going on?  Why did he do that?  Oh, my God.  But but Good Wife, you don't.  It doesn't.  You can miss the whole thing and understand what I'm watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Season one of justified right now, which is dead.  That's right.  Love that.  That's great.  Yeah.  And she I'm watching love love or from black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, from black.  She's amazing.  She's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She for those who don't know this show, she's a clone and plays many different versions.  Nine nine parts, I think.  And it's really amazing because it's like nine different actors.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incredible.  But I do.  I have to say we live in a golden age for people who want to consume television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.  Oh, God.  You know, we cancel HBO.  We don't have HBO.  We canceled after Game of Thrones.  Basically what we would do, we would subscribe during the Game of Thrones run and then watch  girls and all the other stuff during that time.  But so we didn't even subscribe to HBO this time.  We just did HBO now, which was which was nice and worked really well for us.  But I really like that I could start the Game of Thrones.  The new episode was available starting at nine p.m.  Eastern and we could start it when we wanted and we could pause it.  And, you know, we had a lot of functionality and it's a free trial.  You get it for, you know, it's free for 30 days right now to get all the HBO shows.  Their timing is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a good time to get people hooked on HBO.  Yeah, it's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Leo, one of my many weaknesses is popcorn.  I love to go to the movies just to have sit down and have greasy popcorn.  I have not seen a movie worth even considering in two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact, I actually don't actively don't go to movies so that I have something to watch at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's so little to see, is my point.  There's crappy movies.  It's just crap.  TV is so much better than the movies.  I said that when I was a TV critic and it was partly true.  Now it is really.  Now it's actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We interviewed a guy on triangulation.  I highly recommend the book.  And his whole premise is the Sopranos changed everything that with the rise of the writer slash showrunner,  suddenly people who wanted to make movies shifted to TV because you had so much more scope,  because instead of a two hour story, you could tell a 60 hour story and you could really develop the characters.  And the power of the writer increased incredibly thanks to David Chase.  And, you know, it's probably start with NYPD and shows like that.  But now it's writ law.  I mean, now it's there's no there's no question about it.  Even, you know, a lot of filmmakers are making making TV now.  Have you seen Daredevil on Netflix?  That's supposed to be amazing.  No, I haven't yet.  That's the basic one.  I don't know.  It's a no.  It's a comic book.  Have you seen it, Jason?  I saw the first episode.  People are raving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, people are going nuts about it.  I saw the first episode and I couldn't tell if it was just my disconnection with all things comic book because I was not a comic book.  Yeah, me neither.  But it's a Marvel comic from what I understand.  And I don't know.  I felt it was a little slow.  Supposedly it picks up.  But and some of the acting I thought was kind of maybe it's not that great.  But I mean, but no, I put out that I put out that sentiment on Twitter a couple of days ago after I saw it and everybody came back and said, give it time.  You know, and usually with these longer form shows like this, yeah, you almost have to put your faith in it.  That five episodes in you're going to be hooked.  And usually by the time you get five episodes in, you understand where they're going and kind of the theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's what I think that's what's changed.  So yeah, totally.  They made a movie of Daredevil, but it's two hours.  You don't have the leisure to waste the first hour, not waste, but to take the first hour to gradually set up characters, set up payoffs and things like that.  But when you know you've going to especially with nowadays where they buy a whole season and say you got here's one hundred million dollars, make 13 of them.  You got at least 13 hours.  That's a that's a big effort for these great writers.  They're they're just loving this.  What was the name of the book?  It was such a good book.  You probably know the guy.  He was a TV critic.  I can go back to my audible list and find it.  But there was one other thing I wanted to mention real quickly to you, Jeff, the Whirly Pop Stovetop Popcorns Popper.  Oh, this will satisfy your need for high quality movie theater popcorn at home.  Oh, and it kind of looks fun to have in your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  I'll get yelled at, though.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it smells like I shouldn't be eating popcorn is good for you, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a whole grain.  It's oily as hell.  The fat content is to is to.  That's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Haven't you been keeping up?  Everybody knows that.  I got enough of it, Leo.  I do, too.  God knows.  So getting so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the movie popcorn is actually about getting out of the house and hiding out and eating something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something salty and oily and buttery and too much of it.  And I'm happy.  I hate people in movie theaters, but I like the popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to look at my it was a talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I like big screens.  I still go to movies.  But but I notice now I'm much more likely to say let's save that one for home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just finished Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.  That group that grew on me.  It took a few episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a weird show.  I'm not sure how I feel.  Very weird show.  It's very weird.  I'm trying for those who wanted another 30 rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that it's very Tina Fey.  Like if you took me a few episodes, but that what drew me in was the was the song, the theme song.  I love the opening.  The open is amazing.  And the premise is kind of amazing because it's a play on memes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a play on.  In fact, much of the show is a play on on memes and, you know, the modern world.  The plot is that Kimmy Schmidt was in there.  What was the name of the Reverend who put her down there?  Reverend Gary Paul, Gary or something like that, took four Indiana women and told them the world had ended.  And we got to stay down here in the bunker.  And she was there for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's Don Draper.  I mean, it's, you know, John Ham, who plays the Reverend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't I didn't see.  Oh, see, that's a spoiler because I haven't gotten to that part yet.  The Reverend shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  What had happened was I was asked by my grandson when I know what police vehicles came.  OK, we're going to that weird old white house.  It's up in the white house.  I think this is the best TV show theme ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the full version.  They don't usually show this whole thing.  They're using songify.  This is actually all you really need to watch.  True.  I've never seen the whole thing.  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Females are strong as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I'm glad I live in the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seriously, it's so meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's meta, meta, meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, white dudes hold the record for creepiest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to listen to every line he says.  Apparently, you can get the video of him just doing the talking, and that's hysterical.  So I'm not.  But the rest of the show, I'm less.  It's like less.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's moments where it's a different definition of cringe worthy.  Not cringe worthy because it's bad, but cringe worthy because the situation is just so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I love it because I make fun of every rich New Yorker.  I love the rich New Yorker.  And Broadway types, naive young white women.  It's the whole gamut.  It took us a few episodes that we got into it.  Get to Richard Gary Wayne Gary.  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know it was John Hamm.  And that's going to change everything.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Completely different actor than Mad Men, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I love him.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, here.  Have you heard this confession from me?  You don't like Mad Men?  I cannot get past episode one.  I've tried four times.  Can't do it.  Episode one is just cliche written, overdone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're going to really hate this season because it is everything you hate about Mad Men.  And I tried the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if we talk about last time, I tried.  And I went into episode two and I made like five minutes and I said, I can't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why we love it, but we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This season is a little with the new seasons along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rooting dawn.  I'm a little enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the TV portion of this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't mean to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not you.  What do you mean you?  I take full responsibility.  We went there, man.  We did.  Actually, I was going to segue into HBO Now.  This was the launch of the over the top version of HBO.  People could, without a subscription to a cable company, pay $15, get HBO Now on Apple TV,  iPad or iPhone, and watch Game of Thrones and Veep and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no Android yet.  They have an exclusive with Apple and I think it's just for the first few months.  But so far, no, it's iOS only.  Snobbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in-app purchases through the app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Apple gets a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a weird subscription experience, I thought.  Did you do it?  Yeah.  I thought about subscriptions a lot.  Yeah.  I signed up for HBO Now.  I did it on my iPad and then I wound up.  So if you signed up on your iPad or your iPhone, then you could watch it on the web.  So I watched it on the web and casted it to my TV.  Oh, nice.  I casted the tab.  And given even all of that, it was very performant.  And this was Sunday night when Game of Thrones got released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was the question mark was because remember last year, HBO Go had horrible problems.  Sling TV, similar problems during March Madness, the NCAA basketball tournament last month.  So HBO had gone to MLB TV, the Major League Baseball Network, to supply the feed this time.  And it worked.  Yeah, somebody got hired and hired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had spent millions on their own thing in Seattle and they fired the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they did.  They did a good job because it worked.  But the subscription process was a little weird.  So you download the app on the iPad and then you would opt into this free trial, which  then just starts charging automatically after 30 days, which I kind of hate.  I know, because you always forget.  Don't make it opt out.  So you would do that.  So now iTunes has all my information and I've opted into this free trial, 30 day free trial,  which I got to tell you, very generous, 30 days of unlimited HBO on the web.  That's great.  But then I had to create an account, which I was like, why am I creating an HBO Now account  when the App Store has my information?  I know that the App Store sandboxes that.  Still felt like a weird experience.  And I also just wished that it had been on my, you know, I wish that I didn't have to  go through my iPad, which I barely touched and it was kind of slow.  But, you know, there's still that iOS first thing happening.  So it was a good experience, except I didn't like the opt out.  You could go in and then and then edit your subscription and say, don't auto renew this.  But you had to opt out of that.  But for the most part, it was pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They learned that from porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exciting.  They learned that from porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But haven't we learned from porn after all?  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff.  Auto renew auto renew was something that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, we need to auto renew your lighting system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have auto renew for Jeff's lights.  Either that or they just think you're dead.  I'm alive. I tell you I'm alive.  Yeah, auto renew is the bane of my existence in many cases.  But by the way, Jeff, the name of that book was Difficult Men.  Brett Martin. Did you know him?  No.  He was a TV reporter for I think he was a New York magazine, a bunch of other places.  But the premise of this is there was a creative revolution in television that started with the Sopranos, the Wire and up to more recently.  And he talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the point is right.  But you can actually also go back in my era.  It was Hill Street Blues and Cosby.  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think you're right.  That's where it begins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, he talks about Hill Street Blues in it.  Yeah. OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not popular to say anything about Cosby these days, but I think he had a big impact on TV in its time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. David Chase, David Simon, David Milch, Alan Ball.  He talks about Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan.  It's really good.  Difficult Men is the name of the book. I highly recommend it.  Let's take a break.  There is and I know Jeff will have something to say about this.  I'm going to take my blood pressure pills.  Take your pills, Jeff.  There's something going on in Europe and Jeff is not going to be happy about it.  But first a word from ZipRecruiter.com.  If you're in the unenviable position of having to hire for your company, whether you're the HR person or maybe it's a tiny company and it's just you and you need to hire an assistant.  In fact, this is a lifesaver.  You've got to know about ZipRecruiter.com.  It lets you post to... this is new.  We say 50 plus job boards.  I just went to the site.  The site that says 100 plus job boards with one submission couldn't be easier.  You also get social networks like Facebook and Twitter.  I know though some of you are saying, well, I don't want to post to 100 job boards.  I'm going to get so many applicants.  Well, you want that many applicants.  The reason you don't want them is because you've got all those emails and phone calls.  But ZipRecruiter eliminates that.  They provide you with an interface.  All the calls, all the emails go to their interface, making it very easy for you to screen candidates.  Pick the right candidate.  Very straightforward.  In fact, so much so we've arranged a four-day trial.  That will be enough to hire your first person probably.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  Post to all the top job sites, all the social networks, single click of the mouse.  Find candidates in any industry nationwide.  They make it easy to screen the candidates.  You do it all within the ZipRecruiter interface and they have ZipRecruiter's premium traffic boost,  which will give you as many as three times more candidates.  And you don't care.  You don't mind because you've got a great way to handle them.  The more candidates means the more likely you're going to find the right person.  So as long as there's a way to handle it and ZipRecruiter gives this to you.  We love this, by the way.  We love it.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  Get 30% off your first traffic boost and a free trial.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  We thank not only thank them for their support, but thank them for making a really great service.  It solves a very big problem for people who have to do hiring.  All righty.  So, of course, it's so really interesting.  I love hosting shows on Twitter because every host has a different take.  Paul Thurot was thrilled that the European Union was finally, finally going after Google.  And you and I have had this discussion a couple of weeks ago because of the FTC documents that were leaked out to the Wall Street Journal by accident.  Apparently, the EU is reading the Wall Street Journal and it has now announced an investigation of Google on two different fronts.  One, in the shopping realm favoring their sites over competing sites and search results.  And two, the deals they make with Android phones, AOSP versus true Google experience.  Go ahead, Jeff.  It's kind of what I was saying though, Jeff, that, you know, they need to be above suspicion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so you're lying to yourself with the EU.  Good, Leo. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the place you want to be.  I'm just trying to get you really ripped.  I know you are. I was getting myself ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo's going to do the devil's advocate thing here today.  All right, a couple of things.  Number one, I'm shocked at how little they have on them, right?  So, BFD, Google points to its own shopping advertisers.  Right?  And we've had this discussion last week and we've had it before that, of course, the media property promotes its advertisers.  No big deal there, but that's all they came up with.  The actual formal complaint is that.  And that's the possibility of a $6 billion fine.  $6 billion because it points to shopping advertisers.  I got calls today from BBC and ORF and Austria and others.  And so they said, what's Google going to do?  And I said, well, you know, at one level, if Google just kills comparison shopping in Europe, it'll be a blip on the P&L.  They don't make that much money from that.  It's nothing.  So kill it.  You know, screw it.  OK, Europe.  And what good do that do consumers in Europe?  Nada.  There's no consumer.  There's absolutely no consumer damage that can be found here.  And in the follow up on the FTC story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, that is Google's response exactly on the official blog.  They title it the search for harm.  And they point out that these companies are doing great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the FTC, you know, and the follow up to that story was that it was not a political thing.  It was both parties was a unanimous vote against going after Google because they found no consumer harm.  So that's this entire $6 billion fine because they promote their shopping advertisers.  Now, again, the European this is all European publishers because they had agreements with with the EU a couple of times.  And and the political pressure stayed on from publishers to keep going after Google and also from Microsoft.  You know, you have no shame.  You have no is it is it pure schadenfreude Microsoft really, really?  You went through this.  You paid more than three billion dollars.  And just for the sheer joy of seeing someone else screwed the way you're screwed, you join in on this.  So that's that's the one is the shopping thing.  And that's it.  It's kind of ridiculous.  And you know, I think that's the one piece is they've announced they're going to investigate Android, but there are two.  I just find this amazing.  You know, Apple doesn't give away its OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't do anything.  Yeah, that was my response to Paul.  It's as if you're penalizing Google for offering a free version of Android.  Yeah, maybe it's it's limited, but they're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Apple doesn't do that exactly.  And you're and you're perfectly free to put business conditions on that.  It's a symbiont.  You know, it's it's free.  And is it is it undue market power?  Well, no, because Apple is is still gets the lion's share of the attention.  It's it's a this is a purely political act.  It's not a consumer protection act.  It's not an antitrust act.  It is an anti-American act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know exactly where I stand on this.  I mean, I've heard both arguments, Paul's very strongly in the other camp.  I think I tend more to your side, Jeff.  I think mostly because it's hard to show how Google has harmed anybody.  Now, the the Android investigation is as much to see if Google has reduced competition in handsets and mobile phones.  And but that's but if they've done it, they've done it by being successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd be a successful and be free.  I mean, could you accuse them of dumping an OS in an open space in an open source world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That kind of logic doesn't work anymore.  Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you issue with Google's requirements over, you know, the fact that Android handsets with the Google logo or that run Google's proprietary software like have to meet particular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want the place if you want the Play Store, which, of course, you do, you have to take everything else along with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Search and email calendar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's a quality control.  That's that's a perfectly legitimate business for business demand.  A you know, we're giving you the free website.  The condition is you take the stuff that's going to benefit us.  Don't don't want it.  Don't do it.  No problem.  B you can go off and use one on your own.  You just won't get the Play Store and our stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, many have Amazon has done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Microsoft has done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frankly, there's a there's a Microsoft X phone that is based on AOSP, the Google version of Android.  And I think that's what baffles me a little bit is that look, Apple is totally proprietary, doesn't give away a free version.  They're OK.  But Google.  Giving away a free version somehow is made that worse, made that bad.  You don't think that's the message you want to send to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and once again, I'm going to argue this is what I call Euro technopatic.  And Europe should be aware the message that it is sent to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree a little bit more on the danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree a little bit more on it on the the first part.  I do worry and we've talked about this and I'm not going to belabor it, but I do worry Google has and Google, by the way, is more of a monopoly in the EU than it is here in the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, but there's nothing illegal about being a monopoly.  What's illegal is using monopoly power unfairly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think if you ask somebody and they would say, do you think Google favors its own sites over competitors sites in its search results?  Most people would say, well, of course they do.  That's just good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, they do it a lot less.  We said on the show a few weeks ago, but the origin of of search based advertising was to buy position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And I did, in fact, do that search that you recommended of videos on Bing versus videos on Google.  And Google doesn't even show up if you search for videos on Bing.  It's all Microsoft stuff.  So everybody does that.  I would I would argue that Google should be held to a higher standard.  We've had that argument.  I wish Google didn't have these related businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of argument is you argue to split up Google, you know, that should be safer.  They shouldn't do certain things.  But but as I was preparing for your counterintuitive arguments, I prepared for this.  Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  We're screwed.  This goes this goes to the European privacy issues, too.  Right. So if you split up by one means or other, by not allowing data to go across or by splitting up the company, whatever, if you split up Google in some form or another, search will simply not be as good if it doesn't have Android.  Android will simply not be as good if it doesn't have search data.  Yes, and on and on and on.  You know, whatever you use from Google, the more you use it, the better it's going to be for you.  And that's a new business reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big data aspect of it is very valuable to me.  I use Google now and the more it knows about what I do, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish that were true for me, but that's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't actually get the benefit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I let me but speaking purely from my own perspective, and this is going to really come up because Google is changing the partnership agreements on YouTube.  Which may chase us from YouTube.  And if that but so let's say they do because right now we are all our shows are available on YouTube.  But if you searched for our this week in Google on Google and Google favorited the YouTube version versus some other version.  Because it's YouTube and because they make money on it, that would that could be a real detriment to my business.  What proportion of your well, it's not it's not much.  It's not a big deal.  But let's put it this way.  The way Google wants to do it is we'll take care of all the advertising.  You don't have to think about that.  They don't like it that we sell our own advertising.  That's why we're going to be banned from Google eventually.  But they take 45 percent.  Yeah, so I'm not interested particularly in Google's participation in my advertising.  I don't.  So here's the secret where there is something worth watching from an antitrust perspective is not about consumer services at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's about Google's power and advertising.  That's where Google is a monopoly.  And we've had this discussion.  But the search results are all I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google can put me out of business by making its search results favor Google properties or at least to stay in business, forcing me to sell use Google's ad sales instead of my own.  And I feel like that's using its its near monopoly in search to enter a new market.  They're in the YouTube business all of a sudden.  But you're right.  It is advertising is the business and that's not a new market for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they use in their market power sometimes.  You know, the other funny thing about it is Google Fiber, right, has pushed competitors to offer better service.  And now the Google and V&O, the more we're starting to learn about it through leaks and such, the phone service is going to push the phone industry.  You know, it's a weird thing.  I don't know what the analog is for your example of before there's a YouTube.  There's no open platform you could have been on for the sake of it.  We don't use YouTube.  We don't need YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if YouTube by if Google by changing its search results forces us to use Google, use YouTube, it will cost us a significant amount of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I get it. OK, now I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, we don't want I don't but I'm willing to put stuff on.  So here's the email I got updated YouTube partner terms.  Your fans want choices.  Hmm.  That's a bad start.  Oh, not only do they want to watch what they want whenever they want it anywhere on any device they choose, which, by the way, is a direct ripoff from a speech I gave 10 years ago.  They want YouTube features built specifically with their needs in mind.  Over the past several months, we've taken bold new steps to bring these experiences to life.  Blah, blah, blah.  By to build on this momentum, taking another big step in favor of choice offering fans an ad free version of YouTube for a monthly fee by creating a new paid offering will generate new sources of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising revenue.  By the way, from their point of view, that fast growing advertising revenue is is from them and them alone.  Launching a new paid offering will require us to update your terms through your creative studio dashboard process that should feel familiar.  If you look at it closely what they say is if you it's the same thing that they offered that musician we were talking about.  If you do not want to participate in this no problem will make all your videos private.  Oh, well.  Yeah. Oh, so I say have Adam a European Union.  And if you want anybody to testify, I'll be glad to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this goes back to our discussions, Gina, about about Twitter and developers over the years to when you become and what they did by cutting off the fire hose people.  When you become dependent on the platform.  We've had this discussion before, but but there needs to be some major discussion about what about definitions of what's ethical behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, this doesn't really bother me because they aren't important.  I never did build on the YouTube platform.  I've always been against building on somebody else's platform always.  So we now aren't so at risk because of that.  But I think there are a lot of people might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like to me, Leo, it seems like YouTube, the best use of YouTube for you.  And of course, this would require a lot more sort of editing and that kind of thing.  But like Mimi, 30 seconds, 30, 60 second mashups of ads, ads for Twitch shows, you know, that people want to share.  You know, best highlights.  That's and we do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's if in the worst case scenario, if this all happens, I don't know if it will.  But if this all happens and they kick us off YouTube because we have our own ads, no problem.  Because that's exactly what we do is ad free versions of short versions of our shows.  We do it right now.  YouTube dot com slash Twitter.  We do it right now.  You do for Facebook, too, because that's because shorter things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina is kind of brilliant because they don't want you to have your own ads.  So you just become an ad instead.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, no, look, it's always, always a risk when you become dependent on a platform.  Listen, we just went through this with ThinkUp.  We built ThinkUp's billing system using Amazon payments and Amazon deprecated a sunset of the product.  And they didn't offer any sort of well, they haven't yet.  I actually think they're changing their mind, but they didn't offer a way to take existing subscribers and move them into their new system.  And it's going to be a big hit to us.  I mean, it's subscribing customers who pay us through Amazon are going to have to come back and repay.  And, you know, it's tremendous.  And actually, I'm working with them now.  They're there.  They are maybe going to create some sort of transition tool because so many people were so upset.  But it's one of those things, you know, as particularly as a small startup or any kind of startup like you, you're going to depend on APIs and services and hope that they're going to do the right thing.  And you hope that these huge platforms like Amazon and YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are going to do the right thing.  We're going through a similar thing with Facebook.  Facebook, the graph API 2.0 is way more limited than it used to be.  And so we're going to we have to think up has to kind of pull back the data that we pull, which limits and the kind of insights that we can create.  But it's like kind of like life in the big city.  I mean, I think it's really important for all of us as consumers, APIs and as consumers in general to ask these companies to do the right thing.  And Leo, you know, you have a right to complain, although I definitely I definitely would just keep doing the Twitter.  That's the way that you're doing.  I mean, you are smart to not become dependent on your distribution channel.  But it's very tempting because it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So people would say, oh, this is great.  You could get and then a lot of people built their business on YouTube.  Now, when you do that, you all along, you knew you were going to only get 65 percent of the ad revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's other examples of using, you know, we've had we saw eBay got people addicted to them as a service.  And then when they own the market, they they increased the rates, opening up the door, by the way, for Amazon to come in to the business.  It does. It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a care.  Part of the problem is there's no competition for YouTube at this moment.  But my my my larger issue wasn't with this.  What was with this?  This is my example of how monopoly and search could promote a subsidiary business in in this case, Google search favoring YouTube results would harm me because I either have to exceed to Google's demands for 45 percent of my revenue or not be on YouTube.  And if YouTube is what shows up when you search for this week in Google, that may not be I may not have a real choice.  So that's where they can use the leverage of search to enter a new market streaming videos.  But it is all ad sales.  So I don't know if it's a new I don't know.  You know, I'm just by the way, this process with the EU is much faster than it is in the United States.  Google has, I think, 10 weeks to respond and Google has immediately responded on their blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the question I got asked today.  If you were Google, what do you do?  Because they were saying, do you do you negotiate?  Do you go to court?  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I don't know if there's an appeals process in that.  I don't know what the process is, but I don't know if you go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you don't agree, then they'll say you can go to court and you go to court.  Oh, whippy European court that's done the right to be forgotten decision.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like this is the core of Google's business.  They've got to stand up as hard as they possibly can for what they're doing and fight it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the memo that went out internally, of course, recode got Googlers as the this I presume comes from Larry.  But let me I don't know.  I have to go to the very bottom.  It doesn't say as the Financial Times has just reported, the European Commission will tomorrow issue a statement of objections, blah, blah, blah.  They say it's very disappointing.  We have a very strong case with especially good arguments, especially when it comes to better services for users and increased competition.  So they've laid out in this internal memo their defense and some of the same graphs that they showed today in the blogs.  I think this is to tell the employees, no, we're going to fight this.  And we think we have a good defense.  This is just the start of a process does not mean the EC will necessarily take action.  For example, they opened and closed an inquiry into iTunes a few years ago.  We have a very strong case on Android as well.  Finally, we know the upcoming announcements will be distracting, but you can help in two ways.  First, by not commenting on pending legal issues internally or externally.  And second, by focusing on what you do best building great products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, meanwhile, today, I think I think the stuff that gets leaked out by the about the MVNO, the new phone service, is Google saying up new business to let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, good, because there might be some temptation to say, oh, well, let's not launch new businesses at this point.  You know, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, again, we said this before.  I think I think Google did blow it to a rather considerable extent by not understanding the political clout of the especially German publishers.  Yeah. And they're late to the party now because those guys are saying, OK, now your position week is, you know, what are you going to do to make us happy?  And they could have had a better relationship with them earlier of mutual interest.  It was it was possible that publishers were all, you know, FOS about their life, doing the right and all that stuff.  But it was a game. And the game went far way too far.  And they didn't they didn't understand the political clout. They didn't understand paying heed to politicians in the EU because they were all going after Google.  They had to do it for about five years. And and there's there is the Silicon Valley slash American hubris here, which is going to have some measure of business impact on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, and not just the German publishers, but the Wall Street Journal, which really kind of well, Murdoch stirred stirred the pot there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's pure Murdoch has an obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here, but here, but look at this. So here's an article in the Wall Street Journal.  Five ways Europe is gunning for Google Europe, feeling left behind by the digital revolution and scared its manufacturing and automotive industries could be next in line to fall.  The Silicon Valley is legislating on all fronts to create what it calls a living level playing field for all digital companies.  Google is the main target of this legislation.  This is a very this is like is Rupert having it both ways.  Oh, yeah. I didn't go after Google.  And by the way, I believe in America. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty fun. I think there's a story to be done here, but I can get done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Amir Mizraq wrote this antitrust tax.  That's right. That's another front Google's fighting on the right to be forgotten.  We know about that copyright that goes back to the Spanish attempt to get Google News to stop snippeting.  And data protection, the privacy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Google stock is marginally up.  Oh, really? Yeah.  So I think the market is saying this is this is Europe blowing smoke up America's rear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. That sounds painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll get some tweets for that.  Sounds like Leo's toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is the blowing smoke button? I need that button.  We need the blowing smoke button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish more people would blow smoke up by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thought of a new feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, by the way, let's try to find the etymology of that.  What is blowing smoke up your rear come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm Googling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a conflation of two different sayings because blowing smoke was like blowing smoke rings.  And then wasn't there a saying like blowing up your skirt?  According to Gizmodo, it used to be literal.  It used to be literal.  I didn't know.  No, this is this is medical procedure.  This is not. No, they actually did do it.  But I don't think that's where the saying comes from is what I'm saying.  It just shows they've been doing high colonics since before the beginning of time.  Google does is not reluctant to enforce its power in interesting ways.  We talk on security now all the time about how Google's telling websites, you got to use SSL.  You got to stop using SHA 1.  And now with Chrome, the latest edition of Chrome, Chrome 42, which came out, I think today, I just got it.  They're turning off NP API, NP API or N PAPI.  How do you say that, Gina? N PAPI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say N PAPI. N PAPI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which really should have been deprecated a long time ago.  It comes from Netscape mid 90s.  It stands for the Netscape plugin API.  And that's how Flash worked and Silverlight worked.  Java. If you are using if you're on a site that uses N PAPI to turn on Java in your browser won't work.  Now, I dropped it version five point five, so I have a feeling there are many sites that still do this.  If you're using Safari or Firefox, you can still still use the N PAPI extensions.  But this is an example of Google using its weight.  I think for good. Yeah, for our benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. There's been incredible leadership, I think, with Chrome.  Just making the web the web better.  Farhad Banjoo. Sorry, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, go ahead. Farhad Banjoo in the times after Google had had a after the EU thing did look back as everyone's going to with Microsoft decision.  And said, how absurd now to think that not including a browser was the right thing to do.  Of course you're going to include a browser.  What's wrong with that? But that's what Microsoft got in trouble for.  I know. That's what I'm saying is that's the perspective of the time.  And he's saying now look at the back at the basis of the Microsoft decision and how absurd its assumption was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's the that's the also the issue with how slow in the US anyway these things move.  Yes, yes. It's a tech move so fast that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so basically he said that Google was going to outgrow this issue quickly and that the next and the web advertising is probably topping out.  I think that's some fair statement.  And that the next this goes back to your YouTube discussion, the next wave of advertising disruption is going to be broadcast advertising coming to the web.  And guess who's in a great position to get that?  Yeah, Google. Google. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, do you are you in the mood, Gina?  Do you ever when you're sitting there with your hot hero sandwich in hand, do you ever say, gosh, I wish I had a Google change log to do?  The Google change log.  The trumpets can be raised at any moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are at the ready all the time.  Even when Gina's not here.  Just in case Gina flies in suddenly, it's time for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before you do the change like we want to do an ad, but would you be willing?  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's change it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool. We'll get the trumpets again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, you can't ever have too many change.  That was a great transition there.  I should have warned you I was going to go to an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hear the words, Leo.  I've got an itchy trigger finger.  I'm like, yes, let's go.  Let's do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Waste no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you're a freelancer or a small business, you know the worst part of the month is the last day of the month when you send out those invoices.  Well, for me, it was the last day.  Probably you're more organized, right?  You send them five days before the end or 10 days before the end.  I would wait till the end of the month going, well, I could send them out in the 30th, right?  The 31st.  And then I'd wait a little longer.  Say, oh, well, I miss this month.  Well, I'll send them at the 30th and this next month.  And then I'd wait another month.  And by then I had five invoices and it was just not nice.  Back when I back in the old days when I was doing my own thing, a freelancer, it was Amber MacArthur who saved my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Encore, encore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a little rusty, so I may ask your help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all right.  We're here for you, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we were talking about Chrome 42 stable earlier, deprecating the NPP API.  Chrome 42 also got a really cool, interesting new feature, which I am very excited about, particularly for the app I work on.  Push notifications.  Web push notifications are now available to everyone.  This is in the stable version of Chrome 42.  What this means, if I understand it correctly, I'm still like researching and trying this out.  Basically, your browser can send you push notifications even if it's closed or the tab has closed, similar to your phone.  And this is happening on Chrome on Android as well.  So this is giving web apps the ability to send you push notification.  Of course, you get the ability to opt out and say, you know, this site should never send me notifications.  This just went stable.  And I actually was trying to find some examples of sites that are using this so far.  I haven't found any except for like developer demos.  But I'm excited about this.  Browsers have had a Chrome has had has had like little pop up notifications.  But the key here is that apps can push to you even when the tab is closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank goodness Gina was here to explain that because I had no idea because I thought I was because I've been asked by websites.  Do you want notifications?  But I didn't know that that's the difference.  So now, even if you but Chrome has to be running, I don't think that Chrome even has to be running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could be wrong.  Chat room, correct me if I'm wrong.  But that's what makes these different than the little notifications that you probably see on different apps.  Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty crazy.  I mean, it also has the potential to be super noisy.  And I have a whole sort of interesting.  I mean, I got this whole sort of rumination about how everything is notifications now, you know, from the watch and the phone.  And it seems like push notifications because, you know, email is a complete mess.  And, you know, users don't have home pages anymore.  This is how this is how apps re-engage people by pushing and sometimes not so well.  Sometimes it's noisy.  But and hopefully these notifications haven't played with them too much will be a little richer and will let you do things with them the way that, you know, the notification shade on Android lets you do things.  I don't think that they're at that level now, but it seems like that's the inevitable path that we're going down.  So I'm excited about this.  I think this will be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, did you I'm sorry, I think I stepped on you.  Did you have a question?  I'm trying to figure out I have some notifications working on some sites.  I'm just trying to figure out which ones does just hacker news do it.  I get notifications.  Oh, that's from Pushbullet.  I'm getting hacker news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I use I've been using Pushbullet for a long time and I really like it.  Lance Seidman in the chat room is saying it's using, you know, the GCM connections over cloud Google Cloud messaging.  So that's yeah.  So so even if Chrome is closed, so that's pretty, that's pretty new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting this strategy because, you know, I now have the Chrome app launcher in my dock on Mac, which means that all the extensions I add on my pixels show up as apps available on my Mac in the dock.  And it's a really interesting kind of move into the desktop.  Like, but I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  And, you know, this is huge for just for web developers who don't have who who say only want to make an app for push notifications.  You don't need to make an app.  This will work through the web, which is which is huge.  Yeah.  So you're going to do this with ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New sites could use this.  New sites. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And new sites could do this.  Right. So ideally, so with ThinkUp, when you get a new insight, you know, my sort of dream of the native app was like, hey, just let me know when I'm going to be able to do this.  I'm like, hey, just let me know when I have a new insight pushed to me when I get a new insight.  And now we can do that through the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where all will it push to you and push to you on your on your desktop?  Will it also push to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anywhere you're signed into Chrome.  Yeah, this is working on Android as well.  So this is kind of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So presumably it will use a notification system native to the OS.  So on OS 10, for instance, it'll use the notifications there.  Right.  Or is it going to give you its own unique style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I think it actually might be it might be a browser implemented.  So I'm not sure if it's going to use an.  Maybe we'll just have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Possibly similar to how you get the Google Now card kind of overlay on the desktop.  Sometimes you see the Google Now kind of notifications dropped out.  Maybe it'll be tied into something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might be similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at my settings.  There must be a setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really new.  And I looked all around.  I was asking on Twitter.  Where can I try this out?  And there's a couple there's a couple Mozilla docs that are documenting the very new sort of Web API that exists.  And I kind of saw I saw one that said, you know, hello world.  But I haven't actually seen this in action yet.  But this is pretty new.  I love that.  Definitely look into it.  I love that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What else do we have?  Lance Seidman says use GCM dot on message event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So Google Cloud Messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And you could just send a message to that and boom, you'd have a pop up.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is the dream.  This is the Google I.O. conversation.  You know, a couple of Google I.O.s about ago about, you know, how all your all your devices you're signed into your single account across all your devices and the devices are aware.  Have you dismissed a notification here?  And so it gets dismissed across all your all your devices.  I mean, this is the, you know, the multi-device world that we're living in.  And so hopefully all these notifications will be smart that way.  Google Cloud Best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking in the in the settings.  It's in the content settings on your Chrome browser.  I'm sorry.  It's under privacy content settings.  And you have to scroll down a long ways and you'll get to notifications and you can block globally allow all sites to show notifications.  Ask when a site wants to show notifications.  That's the default.  Do not allow any site to show notifications and then you can manage the exceptions.  And we see this again.  Yeah, this is what you were getting, Jeff.  In fact, that's what you were getting in last week was a notification.  Yeah, those gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gone.  Yeah, that worked.  Boy, people, people got mad at me on Twitter.  You took up an hour on your little problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all told me to know.  First of all, that was a that was something we all needed to benefit from.  And it was a it was a kind of not malicious, but aggressive Chrome extension.  Netflix extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was called I can remember the name of it, but no, I think that's the one thing that I fear about this, Gene, is that is that bad guys will use it.  You may sign up for something and not know how to get rid of it.  It keeps on bugging you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think actually on the notification panel, it's itself on every single notification.  There's a like adjust these settings or never show me this again.  I know that's how push bullet does it.  It'll say, you know, never show me this again or dismiss this across devices.  So I think I think there's a pretty high level sort of front front row level of control.  And the permissions prompt is similar to when a web page wants to use your location.  So before a site can send you notifications, it'll say, hey, can this site send you notification?  So you actually opt in.  That's the default setting that Leo just showed us.  Right. So, you know, hopefully it'll it'll be a good user experience user can control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google handwriting input app is now in the Play Store.  Now, Leo, you and I have sort of made fun of these handwriting things before we have.  We have. And I get you.  You know, I'm not going to be drawing on my screen very often, but I got to tell you, I downloaded this thing and I started writing.  It was fun. Like it was pretty good.  What I really like about this input.  So now this is this is an alternate input.  It's not a keyboard. They're not calling it a keyboard.  They're calling it input. So like voice input or an alternate keyboard, you can draw the letters on your screen.  And write that way and Google, you know, that that's how you can write text.  It also works with emoji so you can draw emoji to enter emoji, which I got to tell you is kind of fun.  I spent a lot of time drawing a bunch of emoji just to see, you know, how they came up.  So it's this the handwriting input supports 82 languages and it's fun and it's fast.  It's just kind of an alternate keyboard to, you know, if you feel like if you've got a device with a stylist, for example,  so it installs as a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it stalls into keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can switch the input, you know, just the way you'd switch to say Swift key or some alternate keyboard.  You can switch to this and you just tap you tap that little and you scribble and it does cursive.  It does handwriting. It does emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun installing it right now.  Yeah, search for Google handwriting app handwriting input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So I got a new thing just came in.  Thank you to Alex Dennis in the chat room.  This is on the Google Google's Google Plus page.  And I haven't had a chance to try this. Maybe you can try this, Leo.  We you can now task your computer where your phone is.  So if you've lost your phone or it's, you know, stuck under the couch cushions, I guess you can say find my phone.  I actually don't say what you need to say.  If you know where your computer is, you can now ask Google to find your Android phone from your desktop.  If the pesky phone is hiding nearby, you type Google can ring it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, fine. So you're in Google and you type find my phone in the Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you have to sign in for security.  Sign in again to get your phone's location. I'm going to sign in.  Wow. This is in the search results in the search.  By the way, one billion eight hundred forty million results.  I think that's all of them.  Oh, and you can choose the phone, too.  It's so it's looking for my Nexus six, but I want it to search Nexus six is in Petaluma.  Yeah. Let me search for the phone I got my hand right now.  Wow. This is great. So this is the Android device manager.  Do you have you must have to have that installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You apparently you have to have the latest Google search app installed.  And yeah, and it's got this has got to be talking to device manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So cool. So this says and I'm getting and I'm getting a pop up notification that says Google Play Services device location shared Android device manager located this phone.  There it is. Do you want a pat on the back?  What do you want a pat on the back?  So funny. Let me let me search for the phone I got right now.  There it is. Wow. That's pretty good. Yeah. Pretty fun.  In a Google search. Google knows where you are.  Let me see. I'm going to press the ring button because also on the search result is a button to ring it.  Your phone will ring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I stop it? It says it's going to do this for five minutes.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just kidding. There's probably there's got to be a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, you see my new phone is such a pretty phone.  This is the Galaxy S6 Edge. You're still loving it?  Yeah, the battery life is just horrific.  But it's 10 hours. But I carry a quick charger with me in my pocket now.  I mean, what else are you going to do? You can't have an internal battery. So you have an external battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's worth it. I thought you were going to were you doing the watch?  I thought you were going iOS for the watch. Yeah, but it's not out yet.  Give me a break. Wait, I thought. Give me a break. Wait a minute.  Yeah, OK, OK. Sorry. It's a few days from now. For some reason, I thought you would.  I think on Instagram, I saw you getting set up to order. I ordered the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Lisa's is the Apple watch.  I guess now we just call it the watch. Oh, yeah.  But the watch comes a week from Friday. That's actually Lisa's 38 millimeter.  Mine will come a couple of weeks after that.  But Lisa's very generously said you can wear mine until yours comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. OK, so no iOS. Good. Well, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not yet. Not yet. Don't don't don't don't fence me in, man.  I love this phone. The battery life is so horrible.  That I don't, you know, but boy, I love this phone.  The camera on the S6 is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And your fingers, they disable touch on that on the edge there like your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get a few extra little spurious flicks and flugs.  But mostly it's I don't think they're disabling.  They should do more to disable stray. Is there any practical value to the curve?  There's a very minor practical value you can activate.  It can be a night a night clock.  And if you do and I can never get this right.  So forgive me. But if you like this weird, are you kidding me?  This weird little swipe.  Then you get some edge material. That's the weather date and time.  It has notifications checking for news updates.  It'll do sports scores.  That's completely. Oh, it's a ticker.  I think it's a Twitter ticker. There's stock results and stuff like that.  I don't know what the value to that is, but.  And because you can't you can't see it if it's face down.  It's still upside down. Well, I thought I'd gotten that fixed, but maybe not.  It's still upside down. It's just like Samsung.  It's like there we go. There we go.  But I still don't know why I'd want to do that.  And then it does another thing you can have up to five people can have their own individual color.  And let me unlock that. I don't know what this watery thing it does is so weird.  But you can have you can have up to five people have their own individual color and the phone.  The edge will glow in one of those colors if you get a text or a phone call from them and it's face down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is like, OK, great. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there is no bezel to prevent your screen from scratching if it's face down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I kind of don't want to put my. Exactly like why?  Why encourage that? It's kind of begging to be scratched.  But the whole thing's glass. It's all begging. No, that's true.  That's the whole thing is like anyway. It's pretty cool looking.  But it also I love the edge because it's it's just feels this is just it feels so nice.  This is this is the best looking, best feeling smartphone I've ever used.  It's just gorgeous. Oh, it's just really done a nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks just like the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you.  No, it is really gorgeous. You hold it.  You feel it feels like quality. I just feel like it looks so dinky.  It is dinky. It's only five point one inches.  Who thought that ever thought that someday we'd say five point one inches was dinky?  I know five point one only five point one inches.  Only five hundred seventy seven dots per inch.  That's what's crazy. I wish you could see this in person.  It's like what? It's so it's.  OK, let's continue with the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, last thing in the change log. Yes.  Sorry, Diversions is what I love about the show.  It's all about the Diversions. Squirrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. Snapseed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snapseed is that that Google photo editing app that I think was powering a bunch of Google Plus photo stuff there for a while.  Well, the mobile apps haven't got haven't gotten an update in two years, but they just got updated for both iOS and Android.  And pretty good. I play with it for just a few months.  It's cool. Lots of lots of new features.  Stacks let you go back into your edits and undo particular edits much like kind of I guess they're not comparable to layers.  But each edit that you do is its own is its own thing.  You can undo. You can copy edits from one image to another.  Got a bunch of new filters, lens blur, tonal contrast, glamour, glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get a histogram. I mean, this this is nice.  Nice. It's a very creamy image editor.  What are they complaining about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're complaining that the grunge filter has been taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that grunge filter.  So I just did some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lens blur is really nice.  There's so many great things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can undo redo once you select it.  As you say, it becomes part of a stack of changes that you've made that you can go back through.  This is Photoshop in a can. I mean, this is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, for these devices, there's a there's a brush tool that you can apply effects to sections of an image spot repair for healing and retouching certain certain pieces.  Transform adjust perspective.  Yeah, it's a I mean, it's a very professional, full featured image editing app that that does a lot on a tiny screen.  And I think I think it's for for big screen for tablets as well.  I'm crazy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because I was using Adobe's AVX.  Adobe's Aviary.  And as soon as I I didn't even know they changed it.  The only reason I knew is because they they have a new icon that's kind of like a little leaf thing.  And when I said, well, that's different.  And then I went, oh, my God, this is so much better than it ever before.  I love it. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The UI is a really good education and what can be done in a touch first environment, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They really yeah, that's lighting up and down those sliding menus up and down, having just a free form slider across to adjust values.  Yeah, it's pretty it's really great.  It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you choose the filter like this way up and down and then you strengthen or weaken it by sliding left right.  Just fabulous.  You can then pull up more choices.  Nature, people.  Oh, this thing is so it's deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just looks like it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  And you can always go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is right.  You can go back and you can even undo something that's quite like far down the stack.  So if you got a stack of edits, you can undo one that's like two or three down.  It's very good.  Like, actually, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  Let's get rid of that.  Or you can change it.  Really nice.  This this is an amazing piece of programming and it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you combine that with this camera.  This is my this is my new favorite photo tool.  I mean, this blows me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that is that the best best Android camera?  Easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better.  It's best camera ever.  And a phone.  Easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll point you to you can look at some pictures.  Leo Laporte dot smug mug dot com is my and I put them there because I could guarantee that these would be the unretouched JPEGs.  Google was enhancing everything.  So that kind of they do that.  They tend to do that.  So I realized I was showing these are these are unretouched.  These look as good as an SLR's picture in terms of color accuracy, reproduction, tonal range, detail.  Low light is phenomenal.  There's some panoramas in here.  You'll see how good it is.  This is just amazing.  Just amazing.  Camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes you it really I feel like I don't need to carry an SLR with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, I do.  But I don't know why.  How is low light like very low light in you know in a dark room talking.  It's superb.  It's an F1 nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the best.  It's the best.  It's the best.  It's the best.  It's superb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an F1 nine.  It's the fastest shutter, you know, fastest aperture made in a camera phone, which makes a difference.  But also it's got you know, I mean, look at no camera phone is great.  Super great in low light because you know, you have to pump it up and get grainy.  This is a pano.  I mean, it does it does a great job with the panos.  Take it.  It took it just a few seconds to take this.  You just you know, you don't take multiple images.  You just slowly turn the camera.  This.  So this is an example low light.  You see the light up here is off looking in there.  It's fairly murky.  This was lit from window that was on the other side of the room.  So by the to the naked eye, you couldn't see the detail inside the closet.  Then I turned a light on.  So this is with a single bulb.  I would say spectacular.  Just really great.  So very nice.  Very, very happy.  Yeah.  If the battery life were twice as good, I'd be happier.  But I'm starting to realize that that's an unreasonable expectation now.  There's just nobody.  If you're going to have a small light device that doesn't have an interchangeable battery, even the Galaxy Note 4 is 10 or 11 hours.  But you can put another battery in it.  You just that's just an expectation I have to let go of.  Oh, I won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I won't do it.  I can't let go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The OnePlus one still does 20 hours.  Yeah.  Well, the one and the OnePlus one is narrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like it's it's a thin phone as well, but it doesn't have this crazy low resolution.  Yeah.  So it's almost like nowadays you need two things.  You need to not go too nuts on the high resolution screen and you need fast charging.  I'm willing to give it up.  Yeah, I'm willing to give it because it has turbocharging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found, by the way, one and there may be more than one, but A-U-K-E-Y.  Aoki makes an external battery that does quick charging, 10,000 milliamp hours.  So I can charge this quick charge.  It takes about half an hour to get 50 percent from zero.  But in an hour, you could fully charge to 100 percent.  But I can do that with a portable battery now.  So I just carry the portable battery with me and I just plug it in.  And frankly, it's worth it to have a phone that's this beautiful and compact.  I'm recalibrating my thinking. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, for a great camera, I think that thing seems a little gimmicky, but for a great camera, I could see it.  Yeah, you don't have to get the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For 100 bucks less, you can get the square one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think this looks unique and it's beautiful.  Once you handle it, you kind of go, oh.  And by the way, I was sad because T-Mobile only offered the black and the white, but they have like emerald green back and blue.  They have different kind of and they're subtle because it's kind of like, I don't know, built into the glass or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And secretly you're a Japanese teenage girl.  I got this great new emoji app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it. And that's my friends is the Google change.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huawei has announced a new phone with a five point two inch full HD display, eight megapixel front, 13 megapixel back camera, 64 bit Kirin 930 octa core CPU, 2600 milliamp battery, four hundred seventy five euros.  I don't know why we'd be excited about that.  It sounds very kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there you go.  If you want 1080p with that battery in a 1080p screen, it probably does.  It is great.  Better. Yeah.  Samsung does say, by the way, the S6 is selling better than they thought it would.  Much higher than planned for.  They said demand for both the flat and curved screen models.  Very, very good.  Investors and analysts say new devices will generate meaning, generate, generate, meaning.  Hello.  Well, Jennifer, a meaningful earnings momentum in the quarter as the phones go on sale across the world.  So they're not available everywhere.  They just entered the US market this week, last week.  I, you know, I'm not crazy about I haven't been in the past crazy about Samsung.  I'm crazy about this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So tell us the software.  What's what's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TouchWiz. But I immediately first thing I always do is replace the launcher with one of my own, whether you want the Google Now launcher or I use.  Actually, there was a bug, I think, in Nova launcher that I've seen on other Android phones.  I used to use Nova launcher and it was causing problems on this phone as well.  So I went to Apex, which is very comparable.  So I use Apex and that makes it look, you know, Samsung is a limit, has done their own weird skinning of lollipop.  I don't know why the same problem I had on the note for I don't use S finder or quick connect.  I don't want to waste space on it.  There's no way to get rid of those two dedicated buttons, which drives me crazy.  But it is lollipop sort of.  It's Samsung lollipop.  You know, they have to have their little quick buttons, although I kind of appreciate that touch.  But, you know, you don't see a lot of touch with if you use your own launcher.  I wouldn't use the Samsung launcher.  It has flip board on the left.  Unless you're like a major flip board advocate, I wouldn't bother.  It's yeah, it's not it's not junked up.  It's not. Well, for instance, remember how awful the camera app was on Samsung's because they had all these special modes?  Well, you still have modes, but they don't they don't put little pictures in them.  They just buttons now.  And actually, all these most are useless, useful.  There's a promo that has completely manual.  It's like somebody somebody shook him and said, hey, stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where does Google now fit in?  You said the flip boards left.  What is Google now?  If you use a Google now launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Google. So that's the other thing that ours technical was complaining is that the you have to use s voice if you want to talk to the phone with a screen off.  But I don't want to talk to the phone with a screen off.  So I have disabled a Samsung's s voice, which I loathe.  And I just use Google.  And it's got the same.  Oh, by the way, the fingerprint reader really works just like Apple's fingerprint reader.  You just put your finger on it and I can still do.  OK, Google. And it still launches.  It's not super fast, but it still launches.  So I know that's just how I do it.  And Google now, I can't remember what I think I've said.  Double press.  Double press.  I know that's the camera.  I think if you hold it down, I've attached it to something.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can, you know, all these launchers let you have a variety of push buttons and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that sounds like a great device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're still happy with your one plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's getting a little long in the tooth.  I'm not sure what my did you get your lollipop update?  No, no.  I'm just allegedly coming now.  Yeah, days last a few days ago.  I keep the system is up to date.  My system is up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason, that's what I keep telling me.  And it's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not true.  It is not true.  And at this point, I feel like there's going to be a new version of Android that comes out before I get lollipop in this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love my Nexus six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, can I can I I think I'm tired of big phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's begun in the other direction.  Smaller and smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Nexus six is fine.  Camera is very disappointing.  It's very average.  Screen is very disappointing.  It's very average.  This screen will blow your socks off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is now that Leo is going in the reverse direction of size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where he will be in approximately two or three years.  No, I think this is the world's smallest phone.  I thought four point seven was actually perfect.  The Moto X size.  I thought that actually was perfect.  This is fine.  Five one.  This is good.  And it's big enough.  This screen is so good that you can like hold it right up here and read stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm glad I'm glad Samsung is doing well with this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am too, because it was touching.  Go.  I don't know if they've done another competition crap as phone like the S5.  They would have been in trouble.  I like the note four because it is industrial.  So what I think Samsung is going to do is this is going to be the pretty phone for people who want care more about looks and functionality.  The note four will be the pro phone where you can change batteries at SD card and all that stuff.  Yeah.  But of course, with the Apple watch, all of this, I'm just going to send it to Goodwill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  It's all out the window.  I really can't wait to hear your what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how I'm going to feel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of kind of interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of you so far have been kind of meh about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's kind of the same for Android wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My biggest fear is having to carry an iPhone for any length of time.  I do not like I got a little bit.  I am afraid I missed peeved a few iPhone fans on Sunday and Twitter got into it with Ben Thompson, a strut.  Because I said, if an alien from space came down and looked at a good quality Android phone and compared to the iPhone, there'd be no question.  The Android phone's far superior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to download that episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason people keep choosing the iPhone is because they're swayed by marketing.  The same reason people chose Windows because everybody has one.  You know, oh, it's the iPhone.  I don't want to I don't know the difference, but I know that it's the iPhone.  It's a safe buy.  He says you're saying that 75 million people were dumb to buy an iPhone last quarter.  It's not dumb. Not at all.  That's not stupidity.  That's just, you know, I mean, I'm not I don't think you're dumb to carry a flip phone.  You should get the phone that fits your needs the best.  But it seems to me Android has lapped iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, so irritating all the coverage, including the New York Times about the about the Apple Watch didn't even make mention the Android where existed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought similarly.  It was these like weird revelations about smartwatches.  I was kind of like, guys, like, yeah, like there's been I mean, I don't know.  I guess like not.  I mean, it felt a little bit like, yeah, this is what well, but the Apple Watches exist until Apple does it right.  And that's to their credit.  I mean, you know, they've they've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, I use Apple computer.  I mean, I love my Macs.  I've been an Apple fan since 1984 when I got in line and spent twenty five hundred bucks for a very limited computer.  So I'm not an anti Apple guy by any means, but I think that I have to be objective.  And iOS is so hobbled by Apple's insular point of view.  You can't.  No, no, no.  Only we can do that.  So they have NFC, but they don't let it do the things that NFC can do.  You know, they they say, well, they allowed third party keyboards in this latest edition of iOS, but not well.  So you still want to use the Apple keyboard, which is a terrible keyboard.  Just all these little things like Apple says we know the right way.  You don't shut up and do what we say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's Google is getting investigated for antitrust on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what the I wouldn't want Apple to get investigated for antitrust.  I don't see any I don't see Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is for what for controlling something.  Anyway, I will come back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't I don't I don't see that Apple's doing anything.  No, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But by comparison, because Google is open and and yet that's what as you said before, that's what gets it in trouble.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the only thing that bugs me at all, I mean, if you want an iPhone, get an iPhone by all means.  I'm not saying you shouldn't get an iPhone by any stretch of the imagination.  But I just feel like it's Apple is not exactly innovating at this point in iOS.  Oh, and and so to point to Apple, say all the innovation and excitement in the in the in the space is happening there is to miss a lot of really interesting things that are happening out there in the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I love not having an OS, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't worry about it.  It's well, you shouldn't.  And that's the that's the what the what the promise of the cloud is, is it's it's OS independent doesn't care.  Yeah.  So you're saying with your Chromebook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't worry about having to install new software, this or that.  You know, I was looking for the I don't know how do I.  Yes, obviously, install apps on on this, but it's so easy.  It's just no concern.  There's no people say they're saying iOS is simpler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's a really strong example, in my opinion.  Apple, for some reason, when app when the Mac came out, Apple had very stringent human interface guidelines and said, you'll do it this way and you'll do it one way and you do it the right way.  We don't do modal dialogues.  We don't. There was all these things which I was thrilled about.  I mean, that's if you want to enforce rules, enforce user interface rules.  And but they didn't for some reason, iOS.  So every app has its own UI.  And there's and the only thing Apple provides is a home button.  Your only recourse if you can't figure out the U.S. to exit the applications.  I don't know how to use this.  You know, you see, you have to really.  But to Google's credit, they provide its rudimentary, but they provide enough UI that you can go back.  You can see recent apps.  You can still go home and they have a menu button, a three dot menu button that's standard and almost all apps support it.  It's Android apps tend to be easier to use.  But so people think Apple is iOS is easier to use.  It's not. It's baffling.  Most apps you have to figure out individually app by app what the US is, what the UI is.  And it's possible.  In fact, it's often prized by Apple fanatics that an app is completely out of left field.  And do you think I'm off base on that?  You're a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't. I mean, I've had a similar experience.  And but part of me thinks it's because I've been on Android for so long that I just I maybe.  Yeah, it could be that you're used to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I have to stop the show.  I see that Kanye West has just started following me on Kong.  I now am retiring.  Tiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, he's following you where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know about Kong?  Oh, my God.  You are so last week.

Transcript:  Dave Moran's new app, which is a complete ripoff of Kevin Rose's new app and have Williams new app, which cracks me up.  It's called Kong K.O.N.G.  And super. It's super.  Yeah. Hello, super.  Oh, it's more than super because it's also a little bit of riff.  Mark Zuckerberg's new app.  So the idea is it's a selfie app.  This is where for some reason Kanye West is following me, probably because either it's not Kanye West or.  There's no one else following me.  Or or there's only four of us using this thing.  Yeah.  OK, so you're go home.  Then what happens?  That's it.  Now I can make a new one.  But you want it.  Don't you want to make it with a hashtag like something like facepalm?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, now I'm going to post to join facepalm.  OK, now the frame rate is horrible.  OK, now I got to use a filter.  It's pretty great.  Where's the filter?  I take everything I back about I ever said about about Android UI.  I don't even know what to do next.  Take this thing.  That's doesn't undo what I just did.  He says, yeah, but I did a perfect facepalm.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Swipe your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Swipe my face.  Oh, I don't know why I didn't think of that.  Ginsburg Rushmore Midway Citizen Classic Hearst.  Oh, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I think that's a good facepalm.  That's actually really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I'm going to upload that.  Was I supposed to put some text on there?  You can super it with text.  All right.  And I can also share this to Hangouts, Twitter, Instagram or a GIF.  That's why the frame rate is so bad is because it's a GIF.  It's really an animated GIF.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there you go.  Now, when Kanye responds to my facepalm.  Swipe it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to get the star on the Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android does not have Star Wipe.  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  Whatever always left out, always left out.  So this is basically this is he released this.  Hi, Sarah.  He released this.  I don't know why she popped up.  He released this on both Android and iOS simultaneously today.  K-O-N-G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's what the Star Wipe looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starburst.  Wow.  I'm so sad that I don't have that.  See, iOS.  You know what?  I'm sorry, everybody.  I was wrong.  iOS is better than Android.  iOS exclusive Star Wipe.  What is Kevin Rose's app?  It's gone now.  Right.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Masters of the universe.  What is Path doing?  I think Path is non-existent, which is why Kong is the new Path.  I used to love Path.  I was a big Path fanatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It smells like a pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Smells like a pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I read somewhere.  Actually that's a really great title.  Yeah, we have a title.  I think the CEO posted somewhere late last year that Path is going to a multi-app approach  as opposed to just.  Oh, well here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Multi-app.  Because Dave basically does everything Mark does only later.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I like Dave Moran actually quite a bit.  I think he's a very smart guy.  iOS app store-wide Q1 revenue 70% higher than on Google Play worldwide.  That's up 70% higher.  So that's why if you wonder why apps come out first on iOS revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the dynamic of that?  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anybody who's stupid enough to spend a thousand dollars on iPhone is a sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, Leo.  You're not guaranteeing any fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We get him some secret service protection.  No, no, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the iPhone.  I think it's a beautiful device.  But I think it is the case that we've known this for years that iPhone users spend more  money on apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have accounts with their credit cards attached to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But everybody does.  It doesn't Google Wallet automatically debit you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right.  But you have to set up a Google.  You can create a Google account without ever entering your credit card.  So you can have an Android phone and be logged to the Play Store and get tons of content  for free, but never buy something because you just never gave them your payment information.  Where payment information is sort of central to create.  I don't know.  I did it so many years ago.  But iTunes users, I mean, they spend money on stuff in the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was obviously being facetious, but there's a little bit of truth to the fact that they're  more affluent.  They're willing to spend a lot more on a phone than others.  And so that would also carry on to apps.  And I guess then you could make arguments that maybe the apps are deemed more valuable  or I don't know how that would be true, but maybe you can make that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that might be the perception because apps are approved first and vetted.  And because the Apple culture revolves around design over functionality and customization,  the design of the operating system was historically more beautiful than Android, although I would  argue that's not the case now with material design.  But it's been a long journey to material design.  And just design and fashion and style is central to Apple's products and I think then to the  people who like them and buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But at some point you're just playing damn Candy Crush and how is it 70% higher at Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well OK, there's also the other argument, which I think is true, is that people who  buy, remember Android phones are a broad range.  There's the top of the line Android phones, but the vast majority of Android phones sold  are under $200.  So I think the other side of the argument is maybe not so much that people are spending  so much money on iOS, but the people on Android don't spend any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which also argues that there's a bit of technological redlining going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but that's self-redlining in a way because you could, no matter where you are, buy any  phone.  I mean, Apple's in almost every country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, by redlining I mean that if you can't afford an iPhone, you're also not going  to get the latest apps.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's another thing that's interesting about Android is most apps are,  a lot more apps are free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whether they're free or not, you're not going to get access to them because they're going  to go to the rich people first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, Meerkat will come out on iOS and delay Android.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And for Meerkat, since there's no purchase issue, there's not an in-app purchase or any  money changing hands, why not go for the larger audience, which is the Android audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, developers are not so different from real people.  They have their favorites.  Prejudices, biases.  I don't want to say biases.  I don't want, I think everybody's thinking I'm somehow putting Apple folk down.  I bought several iPhones.  I spent far more than a thousand dollars on the iPhone.  Let's keep getting you in trouble.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am one of them.  Yeah, likely story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're just scared now.  You're scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, when I say that, you go, Leo's such a yuppie.  He spends so much money on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like I can't win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not yuppie.  It's your job.  It's my job.  I still feel sort of bitten by the iOS for stuff.  Like it's signing up for HBO now.  I had to break out the API pad.  Isn't that frustrating?  I mean, there's a certain apps like Instagram releases that new hyperlapse.  I would love to try that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they said at the time that that was because only Apple allowed them to do  what they needed to do.  And that as soon as lollipop came out, they would put it out for lollipop.  And they didn't maybe because hyperlapse kind of is over.  I don't know.  I love hyperlapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I just totally missed it.  And I have to say the slow mo thing that the iOS camera does, that has also inspired some  jealousy on my part.  OK, I've seen those like little slow mo videos on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This does exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what app is that?  That's a Samsung app or that's the camera building camera app.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Slow mo and fast mo.  But not homo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I'm using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's built in.  That's just built in.  You don't have to.  There's no button for that.  It has.  Jeff's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there slow mo setting in the default camera app?  And I'm here.  I'm complaining that we don't have slow mo.  Now I'm checking.  It depends on your camera.  Is it as nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google camera does not have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google camera does not have it.  OK, so I'm not crazy.  And I can tell you, those slow mo videos, I mean, I've seen my friends' kids skiing off  of mountains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's really clear and nice.  I mean, just like super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if this does it as well as that because I agree with you.  The iPhone is incredible what it's doing.  This has the capability because this can do 60 frames per second.  It could do 4K, 60 frames per second.  I mean, it has such a fast processor in here.  It can do all of that.  So if they haven't done that, that's just Samsung not living up to what they could do.  So there's nothing inherent in the iPhone that makes that possible.  And I should point out, there are apps that cannot be done on the iPhone because Apple  will not give developers access to low level features.  So I can tap this phone to my camera and it will automatically copy all the images  from my camera, my DSLR, to my phone.  You can't do that on an iPhone because Apple, even though it finally has put in an FCN,  won't let anybody have access to it.  And there's lots of things like that that only Android can do because only Android allows  developers access to low level hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's both ways, but I agree with you.  The pot...  And see, but this is also part of it.  It's the cool kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's celebrity culture too.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the cool kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only time you see an Android phone in a celebrity's hands is when Samsung is doing  this.  It pays Ellen to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she immediately goes back to her iPhone as soon as she gets backstage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And then she tweets from my phone backstage, right?  I mean, like...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go, ooh, get that thing out of my hands.  But it's cool kids.  And it's the same thing with the app developers.  They want to be where the cool kids are.  I guarantee you, Kanye is not following me on a Samsung phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's following me on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's...  And so that's another part of it.  It's Meerkat.  It's not about money from Meerkat because they're free.  It's...  Or Periscope.  It's about being where the cool kids are, being a cool app.  And it's really important.  You know this.  When you're an app and you first come out, you've got to be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the Periscope and Meerkat things.  I feel like that's sad.  It's so frustrating for me as an Android user.  It's like, why can't I...  I want to watch this, you know, this stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're not a cool kid.  You are just like me.  We had to sit at the other end of the lunchroom, looking at the cool kids, eating our sad little  bologna sandwiches.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we're really...  Oh.  Let's charge them with therapy, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  But I don't know.  Maybe, Gina, were you one of the cool kids?  Were you one of the beautiful...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hell.  I wasn't even thinking cafeteria.  I'd sit in the hallway alone.  Where it's all black, right?  It was your goth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All black, big eyeliner.  I know.  But yeah, no.  I was out there with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought we were the cool kids.  We weren't.  We just thought we were.  That's how we felt better about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was on the newspaper.  Oh, you were a dork.  Yeah.  I wasn't thinking the chess club.  So it was just pathetic.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, Leo.  Leo.  He's a dork.  He's a dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a dork.  He's a dork.  He's a dork.  He's a dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Leo.  Leo, here's the big moment here.  A.V. club?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't get that.  I didn't go that far down.  But I was a drama kid and that was kind of like the A.V. club.  That's okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Gina was Ali Shidi, but she just couldn't do the eyeliner, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I work stage crew.  You were the bad...  Yeah, see?  Stage crew.  Yeah.  Yeah, I ran in the spotlight.  Me too.  Yeah.  I like behind the spotlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, I think that's why the geeks are so susceptible to this because we weren't the cool kids.  So, now we are the cool kids.  People like Dave Morin going, oh, and that's, you know, we want to be the cool kids.  Finally, we're the cool kids.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got an iPhone for sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My son broke his iPhone 5.  He's been using it to open beer bottles.  I told him that was probably not a good idea.  Well, how do you do that?  It turns out the iPhone 5 has a nice sharp edge.  He showed me, he said, look, Dad, it's all scored up.  I said, you...  So, he broke it.  So, Jennifer said, I'm going out to see him.  Why don't you give me an old phone?  I said, great.  I have like four Android phones.  I'll be glad to give him one.  They're unlocked.  He says, no, I want an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop opening those beer bottles, kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use your teeth like a normal frat boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not cool kids that he's talking about, by the way,  and wanting an iPhone.  That's ecosystem, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you mean?  It's not the cool kid drive.  It's that he's invested himself completely in the iOS ecosystem.  No, I don't think so.  Everything Henry does, he can do on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that.  There's nothing he does.  He's not a mere catter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an exclusive beer opening app.  Some people get really into iMessage.  They get really embedded in iMessage.  That's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I miss, yeah, you want to be one of the green kids,  not the blue kids.  And I do miss not having iMessage,  not being able to send the audio with the upswipe.  And that's frankly why I want to get the iWatch,  because I can do the same kind of creepy 3G emojis to my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Gina, how long is he going to be extolling the virtues of,  say, let's do bets now.  Let's start the pool.  How long before he says, you know, iOS is good.  It's the right thing to do.  And then how long before he switches back to Android?  Over, under here.  What are you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Leo is going to have a brief love affair with the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll give it a couple of weeks.  I think the watch is going to do a couple of things a little bit different  than Android, where maybe it's going to be a little fancy or whatever.  But yeah, I think I'm going to give it about a month.  Yeah, I was going to.  And then back, I think back to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a serious risk I might be permanently an iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's already preemptively getting ready.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of gearing myself up.  I'm going to be a self-loathing iPhone user.  You'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really can't wait to hear what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just spent time saying how the iOS isn't as good.  Well, all right, I've told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is my theory, though, but we'll see if this is true.  One of the main things that I miss on Android is the fact that I can,  without launching an app, I can see what's going on with the widgets.  I really feel that that uses the screen well.  I even have on here, and I'm not sure I'll ever use it,  but Samsung bundles Peel because this phone has something,  another thing that the iPhone does not have, an infrared sensor.  So you can use this phone as a remote control.  Let me unlock it.  And Peel puts a widget on the screen that's actually the remote control.  Wow.  And I use widgets a lot, as you can see, for quick and easy access to information.  My whole calendar is here and all that.  And so on iOS, where you merely get this, a grid of icons, and that's it,  I feel it seems so primitive.  But I feel like the watch is going to help because that's basically widgets.  The watch is all of the UI stuff, all the sugar that I'm missing.  We'll see, though.  I'm really sad that the Galaxy S6 Edge came out.  Because if I'd hated this, it would be so much easier.  Now it's going to be a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look how you love turning it in your hand.  Feels good, huh?  Feels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, it's slightly warm.  That's your battery draining.  Oh, God, yeah.  You can feel the battery actually going out of it.  Like a life force draining from it.  Leo's more than just friends with this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went from inner child to going to cuddle with this thing.  Okay.  Now it's really getting weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a terrible, terrible person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo redefines phone sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sex actually with your phone.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back.  We have your tip tool and number and pick and all that stuff.  Gina, if you even remember what we used to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a tip.  All right, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today brought you by LegalZoom.  Oh, man, LegalZoom is awesome.  Five things you can count on.  You can count on when using LegalZoom for your business.  Number one, reliability.  More than a million people, including me,  have trusted LegalZoom to help start their businesses, our LLC.  Lisa did her will.  It's beautiful.  If you're looking to incorporate, to create a nonprofit, to get a DBA,  LegalZoom can get you started right away for a lot less than a law firm.  Number two, experience.  They've been doing this for more than a decade.  You can count on LegalZoom to handle all the details.  They know what business owners need to do.  Three, and by the way, that's a lot of what you go to a lawyer for,  is that kind of experience.  Three, helpful support.  The right people are there to answer your questions.  They're all based in the US.  Legal advice.  They're not a law firm.  So they're not allowed to give you legal advice, but they're smart.  They built a network of independent attorneys,  which you can call on at a fixed rate, available in almost every state.  They can give advice on the best way to get started,  provide contact, track review, other useful services.  I would have loved this just because they didn't have this when I was using them.  But just to say, what state should I incorporate in?  I've heard Delaware is good.  Hooli was incorporated in Delaware,  but Piper is incorporated in California, which is the best.  Finally, number five, no surprises.  LegalZoom provides complete transparency, upfront pricing, customer reviews.  You know what you're going to get, and they have a 100% satisfaction guaranteed.  There's no risk.  Just reward.  I love LegalZoom.  We chose it.  You should choose it too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina Trapani has a tip for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How nice to be able to say that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's talk about Google Keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how long it's been.  I love Keep.  Man, Keep is awesome.  Keep is like the most underrated and unrecognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no iOS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's frustrating because I use it, and Lisa and I use it for our shopping lists and everything.  And she has to use the web version on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how does the web version do a mobile Safari, okay?  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be nice if she had an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  The Android app for Keep, particularly the home screen widget, is amazing.  And it's just got so many features.  Look, I make a to-do list app, and Keep is just awesome.  You can do lists with it.  You can share.  We do the same thing in our house.  We do share grocery lists.  We even share order this on Amazon next time you're placing an order list.  And it got a couple of new features.  Recurring reminders.  So once a week, remind me.  Or once a month, Wednesday, remind me that Twig starts.  And the reminders are great.  You can do by location.  So you can say when I get to the office, remind me to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or when you get to the store, don't forget to get milk.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, when you get to the store, remember the milk?  And they've got you can color.  You can make notes different colors.  And they also added labels.  So you can label your notes as well, similar to the way that you would label things in Gmail.  And you can export all this stuff to Google Docs.  You can very easily, if a note gets long, just convert it to a Google Doc and go from there.  But yeah, there's the widget right there.  Love the widget.  You could do voice input, camera input, start a new note.  So house crap.  That's awesome.  That's our list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's our house crap list.  Things we got to do in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whole foods shopping list.  That's automatically set when I go into Whole Foods.  That's what I have to buy.  This is our Petaluma market set the same way.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, certain stores when you get there.  It's fantastic.  It's such a great app.  And I just I feel like it's kind of under song.  So now we've got recurring reminders and labels.  Yeah, the widget.  The widget's great.  It's awesome.  Google Keep.  I didn't realize that there wasn't an app on iOS.  Sorry, iOS users.  I mean, I don't think we have any iOS users actually.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure that we lost all of them about 20 minutes ago.  They tuned out a few minutes ago.  For the two or three masochists who are still around.  I'm really sorry.  There's an iOS app.  When I get my hyperlapse.  So yeah, Google Keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Google Keep.  Yeah, good recommendation.  Really useful.  And they've had they keep adding new features.  I like the recurring reminders.  That's a really useful feature.  So yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, you has a number for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, just as your expensive overpriced snobware comes out.  Google dropped the price on Google Play or on whatever they call it now of the Motorola 360 down to one hundred sixty five dollars.  One hundred sixty five dollars.  Two forty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's obviously motivated by the snobware.  So you can thank the snobware.  Two forty nine.  What is it?  One seventy.  One sixty five.  One sixty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's reasonable.  So they're going to compete on price.  The Android watches, which is smart.  I think the Apple watch is overpriced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're going to write Android Wear for iOS.  That's what I'm really interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, that's where you're going to run up against Apple's sandbox.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of potential there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little late breaking number.  Etsy priced its IPO at 16 bucks a share the high end.  Oh, it is worth one point seven eight billion.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in the wrong business.  Yeah, you need to make crochet or something.  Make crochet or is happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an app that I that I installed when we went to Vegas called Silvercar.  You guys know about Silvercar?  It is a new kind of car rental system.  They have heard of this.  Yes, they're all the cars are silver.  And they're all Audi A4s with free GPS, free Wi-Fi, free satellite radio and a much better fuel plan.  So it's really interesting.  You download the app.  Yes, they have it for iPhone as well as Android.  It's unfortunately not available everywhere yet, but I think they're rolling out a lot faster very quickly.  What's it cost a day?  It's a good question.  Don't know.  It's affordable.  It's not.  It's and the thing is, is you don't you kind of miss you don't get like the upgrade thing and all the little things that the car and the car is.  The fuel things that the car and you know the fee thing and the fuel thing that all the ways the car companies kind of hurts and all the others get you in the long run.  I I we haven't used it yet because it hasn't been in an airport that I have I've been at.  It's Dallas.  It's it's limited.  Austin.  But it's cool because you don't go to a counter.  You it's like Uber.  You you book it on the phone and then you walk up to your car and you scan the QR code in the car's windshield and you get in and you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like kind of like a zip like zip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Car same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So in that case, do you have a key at all or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Maybe they just what is zip card?  Do they leave it in the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the keys in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, those those those newfangled keys that don't are actually a key.  I like those.  I never take my key out of my pocket no more.  So we were we were up at one one final college visit with our daughter and I went off to get gas and my wife went up to the hotel room and she had the car key in her purse and the car keeps running.  And I saw this error sign on it.  What the heck is that?  Good thing I didn't stop the car at the gas station because it wouldn't have started again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you need that.  You need the dongle.  You lost your dongle.  Yeah, that's not the first time around.  Austin, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix and San Francisco.  Yeah, Johnny Jett, our travel guy told me about the silver car.  He likes it.  Car rental that doesn't suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I love not having to go to the counter.  I mean, that's why I do the Emerald Isle.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can just go.  Yes, same kind of thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.
