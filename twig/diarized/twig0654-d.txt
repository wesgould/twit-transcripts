Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a team building exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you tell Kevin? Stacey fell back and said, Kevin, catch me. Exactly. Exactly. Did you tell Kevin, catch me?  Yeah, no. You better, boy.  Icebreaker. Hi, my name is Kevin and my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate.  Also with us, the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis. Hello, Jeff.  Hello, hello, hello. Do you ever get called Jeffrey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only by my mother when she was alive. Jeffrey. She was enraged at me, really pissed because our wedding invitation when she saw it printed out, I didn't, I didn't. Jeff. Oh, wow. How could I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow. It's not very formal. Exactly. Yeah. And Stacey, did you stay salacious, Higginbotham, on your wedding? Stay salacious? Stay salacious? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was not, although I'll throw this out to everybody. Yeah. Ideas accepted. Two weeks from today is my husband's and I's 20th anniversary. Oh, that's a big one.  It feels like that, but I just looked up, I was like, oh crap. He's like, it's in four days. What do we do? And I was like, no, no, it's much later. But yeah, if anyone has any ideas, I don't even know what to do for 20 years. Oh, that's a huge anniversary.  It's kind of a long time. I think you have to go to Paris as I remember. We're going in July, so that's what he said. Oh, you are. Perfect. So I'm like, okay, we're done. Perfect. Yeah, that counts. That counts. We're going to Sitka, Sitka, Alaska in July.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that'll be fun. Yeah, it's already coming. That's the Twit Cruise. I know. Oh, I forgot about the Twit Cruise. Yeah, so did everybody. Oh, when is it? When is it? It's July 16th through the 23rd. cruise.twit.tv. Although I don't, I think it might be sold out. I don't know. But check if you want to go. It's not too late. It'll be Lisa, my wife and I, and Paul Thurotte and his wife. And we'll be probably, and then there's a few more.  There's a few other Windows people who are going who've jumped on as well. So it's going to be a fun, fun event. The Twit Cruise to Alaska. I'll tell you what, if it goes well, which is so far has gone very well, we'll do another one. And, and you can go you guys can go cruise.  If I may be so so nosy as to ask, is this an excuse to get a free trip to Alaska for yourself? Or do you actually make some money on it? No, that's a very good question. I have done. I used to do cruises for insight cruises, which was geek cruises at the time. And I did about 10 of them. And at the time I was doing them because they were free cruises. But then I realized it's it's free in name only you really have to work pretty hard.  And at this point, we can afford to pay for our courses. So it's really more I think it's more a team building exercise for our Twitter friends, community. I think we make 50 bucks a head or something in some ridiculous ridiculous amount. So there's there'll be some money in there, but not not a huge amount.  Yeah, they give you nice to see your audience. Yeah, mostly it's the honestly that's the real reason to do it just to hang out with plus and you're hanging out. You don't have to do programming. You just we have to do some we have to do some we have cocktail parties we have we have several events we have to do. Yeah. But we want to do more. We're actually doing more than they're required to do.  Yeah, well, that's what I mean is you don't have to lecture or something. Yeah, we have you have one like Yeah. What's your topic? Me? The thing I know the most about. Oh, dear.  No, it's, you know, I don't know. There's Yeah, I think there's one. There's like a meet and greet. There's there's some events. Yeah. And one of which Paul and I will take to a stage and swap war stories or something. Do you go salmon fishing or anything?  You could if you want. There's lots of excursions. There's I'm actually now debating whether I should really go mush huskies on a glacier. But that is an option. I hear that that's super fun. A friend of mine really fun. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. Maybe we'll do that. Maybe we'll do that. Well, if I'm back from Paris, so I'm happy to like wave y'all goodbye at the that's your that's your that's your 20th anniversary. You're going to Paris and doesn't have to be at the same day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's perfect. Okay, that's very romantic. Did I ever tell you that I'm going to work? Does that count? I'm giving a speech on low power wide area networks. You got a good deal. Yeah, that's fine. How do they say that in French? It's so romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, I don't know. They call those LP wands in French. LP wands. I do want to warn you that they call Wi Fi Wi Fi. Yeah, so get ready for that. And they call Vladimir Putin, Putin, which I love. Speaking of it's I feel guilty about even talking about vacations and cruises and trips to Paris with a horrific war.  With a horrific war of aggression going on in Ukraine. And of course, for the last, whatever it's been now two weeks, that's all we've been talking about on these shows even because there's a huge, you know, tech angle to all of this. I don't know how much I want we want to spend. But as you know, Google has pulled out of the market, it's app store out of the market.  But there are Russian app stores and you take a wild guess what the number one app is in the Russian app store. It's VPN like, wow, just took off, just took off in the last couple of days, which I think is sort of encouraging. I mean, we've seen half a million downloads of VPNs in this past week alone. And I think that means that they want to get real news. They don't want the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Julia Ioffe, who is my favorite commentator on this, and she's just utterly brilliant. And she's Russian and American. And she talks about how the only way you can get any information now is by setting up a VPN. And that's only going to be a certain very small elite doing it. But that's it. That's the only way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was listening this morning to the puck news podcast. That's where she is now puck dot news. And she was on the podcast. She was practically in tears. She was just devastated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been it's been really affects her. Yeah, she has friends and also just for the state of Russia. It affects her for Ukraine, obviously, but also for Russia, people are leaving. I've been reading the Helsinki Sonomat thanks to Google Translate. And there are train loads of Russians getting the heck out trying to figure out where to go their credit cards.  Julia reported this, the credit cards supposedly pulled out, they still work in Russia. The problem is they don't work outside of Russia. So the people who are getting the hell out can't use the credit cards now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you can't go to an ATM.  You can't go to an ATM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact, one of the places they said I saw somebody did a an hour long video about how to leave. And it was in Russia. I didn't know. But whoever summarized it said that if you you can still use the Chinese credit card clearances. So in some cities, if you go to Chinese restaurants, oh, Lord, is that for their customers, and you can eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked, Cory Doctorow was on Twitter on on Sunday, we talked a little a little bit about why kicking Russia off the internet would be a very bad idea. Ukraine asked ICANN to suspend Russian internet domains.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but ICANN was never going to do that. I mean, that's actually a relatively common ask. Andrea and I were talking about that. Not relatively common, but come countries do ask this.  For various conflicts or governments will ask ICANN to take their country offline as a as a form of punishment or censorship. I mean, there's there's all kinds of it's not that uncommon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Motherboard quote from Frederick Jennings, a cybersecurity lawyer from Brooklyn said asking ICANN to remove dot R U TLDs or take action against Russian internet traffic is like asking Rand McNally to remove Russia from the map, probably ethically defensible, but practically absurd and counterproductive.  And ICANN said, Look, this is not we are we are non governmental. And the last thing we want to get do is get political because of course, it was Russia that was pushing to get the US Commerce Department out of ICANN and other internet activities because they felt like it was, you know, America being too involved.  So this would just give them another more leverage into that. So ICANN was very clear that no, no, no, we that's not how it works. Yes. It's also, and this is one thing that concerns me about a lot of the sanctions. It would have side effects, harmful side effects that wouldn't really hurt Putin, but might hurt the Russian people might hurt the world economy might hurt other things.  It's very challenging to think of what sanctions you can do that would that would be persuasive to a madman and not really hurt the people of Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you also want political pressure. The other thing that Julia Alffy says is that Moscow has long been anti Putin. He's surrounded by the people who don't like him, but the entirety of the rest of Russia is very pro Putin pro war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what are they going to do rise up against him? They may some point they may not be happy. Yeah, but I mean, is that your strategy? That's how we're going to deal with Putin. I don't know. You actually have a good article you wrote at Buzz Machine. What is our moral line in Ukraine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was and I had no position here. I was trying to just think through the implications of the tough decisions. We're obviously not going to do a no fly zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and that's the simple thing to figure out because how do you enforce a no fly zone? Well, you're going to shoot Russian planes out of the sky. That's how you enforce it. That seems like a bad idea at this point. That's an act of war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But you know, in a way, so if we say that he can, if he can do anything up to using a nuke, then that gives him license to do lots of horrible things. So is there a different line? If he used chemical weapons when we do it, he's using his thermo barric weapons. We're not we're letting them do it. So in a sense, this line in the sand gives him license to use any other weapon. The same as the NATO line. If he attacked Finland tomorrow, he's going to be able to do it.  So in a sense, this line in the sand gives him license to use any other weapon. The same as the NATO line. If he attacked Finland tomorrow, are we now saying we wouldn't do anything the same as we didn't for Ukraine? Yeah. So we've given him license to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also a secondary issue, which is that China is watching very carefully because of course, they'd like to invade Taiwan and and and get calculating I would imagine with great precision, what would be the consequence to them of doing that and watching and see what the West does. So there's more than just controlling Putin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. A friend of mine is the former president of Estonia, Thomas Ilves. And it's fascinating to watch him on Twitter, because he really hates Putin and Russia. And says basically, I've been warning you all these years. Are you going to listen? And he said to Finland, right? Are you going to listen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the points Corey made is that we've been we've been building up to this for 20 years, our America policy and NATO policy has really been preparing the way for paving the way for this all along. But that's not very useful. At this point. It's like, okay, great. Let's take a time machine back. What do we do today is the real question. And what can we do today? And what will be effective today? One of the things I brought up.  It reminds me of how much and you've always said this, Jeff, don't regulate use norms to control behavior, don't regulate the internet use norms, how much we rely on norms in our lives. But when people are willing to act outside the norms, I was this came to me, I was watching a video of a drugstore in Los Angeles where a guy just walks by on the counter starts loading a bag with stuff behind the counter and everybody's like freaked out. And I was like, I'm going to go get a bag.  Somebody's calling 911. But you know, the guy's going to walk out the door with all this stuff. He violated a norm. We're so used to that norm, we think we're somehow protected. There's no consequence to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was the entire Trump presidency was a guy who was repeatedly willing to violate more. I mean, what do you do?  Well, that's, I think that's one of the things that we've learned over the last few years is that, well, in that case, you have to have some sort of accountability or response that is, I mean, you have to use force. That's when the state comes in when you're like, oh, yeah, but now we have to regulate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but when you're using a force against another nuclear power, stakes are so high. And this is this is where I don't I don't think we have a good solution. It's interesting to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a terrible, terrible problem. It is, I mean, this is where this is a snotty kid with nukes, basically, you know, just having a tantrum and going his own way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, and this is Julia Ioffe's take, a guy with nothing to lose. Right. And that's really scary. And she points out this is the problem with people with dictators with people like Hitler and Paul Pot and so forth is, you know, Hitler wanted Germany to be destroyed if he couldn't if they  couldn't win, that the country did not deserve to exist. Fortunately, his generals did not follow up on his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a piece of that to Stacey's Stacey's exactly right about about Trump time. And my argument is that that's about about people who know that they're going to lose their white hegemony, and they don't want to share it with those who follow and so they'd rather destroy the institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. So the reason I bring this up is, is we're seeing a lot of companies, tech companies, try to respond in a way that's reasonable. But it's also there's two kinds of reasons you to respond. One is it's, it's looks good. It looks bad not to, or we can't get our money out anyway, so we might as well shut down. Maybe that's another reason because we can't help it.  But and then there's the third, you're really trying to do some good. And then there's, I think, a very strong question about, well, how, what can you do that's going to do some good? One of the things we don't want Google to leave entirely, because we want people to have some access to information.  Well, there's a good there's a good example. Apple and Google both pulled down their app stores, leaving many Russians who wanted to use signal. Right in the in the dark because they could no longer get it. Or a VPN because they could no longer get it. And so yeah, okay.  Should have left the app store up. I don't know. I don't know. What do you think? I don't know what the answer is. You don't you certainly want to send a very strong signal that this is not okay. But you also don't I mean, look, the rush, most of the Russian people are innocent in this. Right, Stacey, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is the sort of thing we debate over dinner at our house. So I, I think, here's the issue. I think most people in Russia, you know, there's it's like 120 million people 110 million people. It's it's a lot of people. And even if you look at your VPN stats, not everybody cares to know or wants to know or seeks this out, right? So you've got to recognize that by pulling the  app store. Oh, wow. Yeah. And there's 40 million in Ukraine.  Okay. So if you take their access away, not all of them, we're going to access it anyway. What you're doing is taking easy access away. And I still think in times of war, the people who want the information will actually go to efforts to get it. Does that make sense?  Yeah. That's what that's what that was the doctrine in China. Right? Yeah, you also not just go to get information. You also create languages to share information. Right. In China. Right. You create heuristics. You create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we've mentioned before, we'll probably mention a lot. The Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation, the 32 year old Mikhailo Fedorov, here shown in a black hoodie appropriately, has called for hackers to come to the aid of Ukraine. And the response has been dramatic. And I think that's the key to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  black hoodie appropriately, has called for hackers to come to the aid of Ukraine. And the response has been dramatic. Tens of 1000s of self proclaimed hackers have volunteered. And I just don't even understand how you would assign them jobs and manage them. So what you're really asking for is total chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll benefit from it. But did you also see Bloomberg actually did a really good story about an employee, I believe who used to work at Uber who was Ukrainian and now he's gone over back to the Ukraine or back to Ukraine to manage their supply side and procurement. Nice.  Nice. And it was, it was a really interesting story about people who have, you know, other skills coming back and trying to help build the infrastructure needed for war based on their experience. Andre Liskovich. There you go. You found him. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an article from Brad Stone. It's a good story. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A just courage. That's a, that's a really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then there's, of course, there's the mother and children who were killed who in Ukraine fleeing the fighting who was in fact a controller working for Silicon Valley tech company remotely. So it goes both ways. I mean, it really hits all of us. And you want you just want to do something. And, you know, of course, we can donate and things like that. But but what can these tech companies do?  That's appropriate. And this is gonna not gonna backfire. It's very, and you raise next really interesting point, Jeff, which is whatever you don't do is permission. You know, whatever you wherever you don't draw the line. Right. Just permission. And that's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the same with it with the Polish jets now is no, that's too risky. Okay, so now we've said now we've acknowledged that line. Yep. It's it's I mean, so I just I'm just gonna say this at the end, but I'll bring it up now. I just finished listening to where to go. The fun Neumann biography that's just out. Man from the future, the visionary life of John.  Yeah, oh, you like it. You like a lot. Both of you will, I think. But of course, he was a arguably the pioneer of game theory. And so this is Joe was fascinating in the current context of this is all game theory. Right. And are you dealing with with someone who's going to make rational if sick choices in Putin?  Yeah, it is game theory. It is game. It's all game theory. Yeah, all game theory. And it's and it's really interesting to see it then abstracted to that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you remember all of the game theory stuff that went on with atomic war.  That's exactly it.  And oh, wow, it seemed like brinkman brinksmanship in many ways. You have to have a lot of I have a lot of faith in game theory.  I don't know if I have the nerve. It's a game of chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, my brother texted me. He's like, I love you. We might die soon. And I was like, Oh, my God, calm down. I don't think it's that bad yet. I hope no.  No, although my husband did let me know that just nearby in Bremerton is the largest supply of nuclear bombs in the United States.  Oh, there's that.  But you know what? If I'm going to go out in a nuclear explosion, I'd rather be closer than farther.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I'm embarrassed to admit I did go to the nuke map to see.  Do you know about nuke map? You put in your location and then you choose what kind of bomb.  Let's enter a yield or you could select a preset. Let's say little boy Hiroshima bomb, 15 kiloton bomb.  I'll I've got my pin dropped in New York City. So let's just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're safe. You're safe.  You're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But one of the big stories I did at the Examiner in San Francisco when I was Sunday editor there way back when was Lawrence Livermore lab had developed the neutron bomb.  We destroyed life, but the building stay OK. It's the real estate bomb.  And it was developed at Lawrence Livermore right there near you.  And so we did the same thing. We did maps of the Bay Area and what would go and it was irresponsible as hell.  You'd publish that in the newspaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Page one.  That is I don't know if it's irresponsible. It's certainly scary.  I don't know where if I mean you're not going to I think you think Oakland.  There's a lot of shipbuilding, but they're not going to try and knock our ships out.  They're going to they're going to try to cause as much pain because it's the worst over in 15 minutes.  Silicon Valley. I'm not worried about Silicon Valley.  I'm seeing what's the closest point that might be hit by a bomb.  You see what I'm saying?  I'm trying to look. Hey, this is kind of a nuclear secrecy.  If you want to have some fun, here's a nuclear weapon tested by North Korea in in 2017.  If we're detonated say, yeah, we're still safe.  We're still safe.  The the fireball radius is that yellow circle.  Radiation radius is the green moderate blast damage gray thermal radiation yellow and then light blast damage gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then obviously the device is the best thing you can do is stay in your home.  So the worst of the radiation blows over you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the largest bomb ever tested by the USSR is a hundred megaton bomb.  And even that doesn't quite reach Petaluma.  They have a few of them, Leo.  But they're not going to drop a bomb on Petaluma.  Now they might on Bedminster.  So if I were I'd be nervous.  And Bremerton is definitely on the list.  So anyway, it was nice knowing you.  No, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, when you were let's do an old guy's moment here.  Never did duck and cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did duck and cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're kidding me, Stacey.  You did? At your age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where you got under the desk?  Oh, no, those were tornado drills.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also got under the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no.  What apocalypse or another apocalypse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember in my grade school, there were civil defense signs.  Yes.  And there were bomb shelters.  There were nuclear bomb shelters.  And so the civil defense sign and there were barrels of water in there.  So I was aware of it.  I don't remember ever the ducking cover was the and that was more in the 50s where they thought you'd be safe under your desk if there were a nuclear war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's absurd.  It's so magnificently absurd.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know, I think this is a way sometimes people deal with the unthinkable is to trivialize it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and so I was that was that was that a PR effort to make us more scared than we needed to be.  Oh, do you think they wanted you to be scared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, politically.  Here's a fun little tweet.  If you want to be scared, this is Russian police in in Moscow stopping people to see what's on their phones.  Just it's very Star Wars to it.  Look at how they're dressed.  They're just randomly apparently stopping people and scrolling through their messages to make sure that they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means they have the gloves that have the the skin contact.  Yeah, capacity mittens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know how widespread this is.  Obviously, a lot of people are walking by and not being stopped.  I don't know why they stopped these guys, particularly.  I don't also know why they're wearing shoulder pads, but maybe it's just more intimidating that way.  The other funny thing is, and you'll be glad to know this, the police are wearing body cameras in Moscow.  Not to your advantage of sure in any way, but they all have body cameras.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think about Twitter doing the tour onion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the I I think this is what this I would put in there.  Greenwashing.  It looks good.  Not sure what the benefit is.  So they've launched a service that makes it in theory easier to access Twitter, which is right now very much curtailed in Russia.  I don't think they've turned it off, but they've slowed it down and they're certainly going through stuff.  So the idea is to let people in censored countries access Twitter through tour.  And then this is the long address.  I'm not going to say it because it would take me half an hour to read it, but there's a long onion dot onion address.  You need a tour browser and you can go here.  And the idea is, which I'm not using, so I'm not getting there.  The idea is that by going through onion routers, go through many, many, many, many other servers to kind of anonymize your traffic.  But there is a flaw in tour, which is that it's possible to control the entry or exit nodes in such a way that you're de-anonymizing people.  Almost certain Russia does that.  We do it.  So I would not, if I were worried about my life in an authoritarian regime, I would not use tour.  I would not assume tour is private any more than a VPN is private.  So I think that's kind of a mistake to encourage that.  So that's what you want to talk about another tech security thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is actually a really good one.  Yes.  It is the critical infrastructure defense project, which is crowd strike, cloud flare, and it's not Royal Pingdom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is should be somebody with cloud in their name, though.  No, it's ping, ping identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. That's who it is.  They are. They got together.  So CESA, we talked about them last week.  They did their Shields Up document on February 22nd that was basically like, hey, monitor your stuff.  We're not being attacked from a cyber perspective yet, but here's your best practices you should follow.  So these three companies got together.  They teamed up on their various different service offerings and created a free for the next four months set of services that enterprises can use to implement the CESA's Shields Up program.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so the critical infrastructure defense project, there's a posting here on the cloud flare describing it.  Crowd strike is, by the way, a sponsor.  So I'm proud of that. Good job, CrowdStrike.  And I think cloud flare has been a sponsor.  I don't think they are currently and ping identity is the third.  That's really interesting. Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just, you know, we're talking about all these things that are terrible and we're debating all these moral things and those are worth debating.  But it's also worth noting that there are actual steps that if you are in IT, you can take and this is not greenwashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is absolutely genuine. Good stuff.  Right. Yeah. Critical infrastructure defense.org is the website.  Free cybersecurity services and support for four months.  And this is in response to a potential threat from Russia of cyber warfare, cyber attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which I will toot my own horn.  I have a guy coming on my show tomorrow.  So tomorrow's show, we're going to talk about the potential for industrial controls being hacked.  So infrastructure attacks by Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.  And just as a sneak peek, I'm going to tell you that right now it's not happening.  We don't need to worry about that.  Which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm not sure if that's showing restraint on the part of Russians or if the Ukraine is a little busy.  Yeah, maybe. Or Ukraine is knowing that Russia has been testing out their cyber warfare capabilities in Ukraine for a decade.  Maybe they're prepared. Maybe they knew this.  You know, maybe they're actually pretty hardened.  By the way, I think it's a couple things. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are, I mean, in Ukraine, yes, they've been, yes, taking action.  But also I think Russia can't do it in other places because that is, you know, going to demand an immediate repercussion.  If Russia suddenly comes in and attacks our infrastructure, we know they're already in our infrastructure.  If they do anything with that, especially if it leads to loss of life, that's like Pearl Harbor all over again, except the launch from a computer keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we have our cyber warriors. They have theirs.  China has theirs. North Korea has theirs. Iran has theirs.  I think we want to keep this from kind of getting into a hot cyber war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's really a lot of this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think also any sort of cyber attack in this, it's not going to remain in the digital sphere, right?  If they actually blow up one of our dams, we're going to send actual military resources over there.  That's what I mean. It's not going to be us going and hacking them back.  It's going to be us being... Oh, yeah. Okay.  You flooded Buffalo, New York. We're coming after you now.  Yeah, but what if you did something less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you shut down the power grid and you did it in a way that maybe was not attributable to bad guys from Russia?  What if you did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be attributable. I mean, we can figure that stuff out pretty well.  I mean, it might take us a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are we going to do?  Well, if people actually die, I think we would.  Okay, let's say people die. What do we do?  Okay. If 500 people die, we're going after them.  I promise we'll send troops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We send troops.  The problem is how does this not escalate into a nuclear war that will kill hundreds and hundreds of millions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why I think Russia is kind of saying, hey, we're not going to deploy this yet.  That's why we're not there yet. People are worried about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They threatened last week to use nukes.  And let's hope that maybe cooler heads are prevailing.  But if Putin is nihilistic at this point, I think there's a real danger in the next few months if it does not go well for Russia, that they will start doing things that are threatening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And I think the other thing that's going to happen is I follow very closely, oddly, Finland and Sweden.  I'm fascinated by this.  And thanks to the very good Google Translate, I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're terrified. They're right on the border.  And the fear is if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, who's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And in Finland, literally, people are calling and saying, if it happens, where am I going to be called up to?  And where do I volunteer and stuff like that?  He considers that a hostile act.  But they need the protection.  And then we're on the hook to protect them.  But I go back to my post.  If he goes and attacks Finland, OK, we stand back again.  If he uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, we stand back.  Is there no other line besides crossing the NATO bridge and nukes?  Is that it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrick Béja, who's been on our show many times as a podcaster who lives in Helsinki, had a long Twitter thread about, you know, just his own anecdotal stories of what's going on in Finland right now.  I found it very, very interesting.  Let's go to the very top here.  The view from Finland.  You know, I don't know. It's complicated.  I'm not going to read it to you, but it's because there's like 20 tweets.  But Russians have always been torn between the reality of their TV and the reality of their fridge, which relates to sanctions.  Whatever Finnish authorities thinking about right now, they're starting to look at decades old plans.  For handling hundreds of thousands of refugees, not from Ukraine, from Russia, trains and buses from St. Petersburg have been full for days.  And with the Russian economy about to collapse, things aren't going to get better.  Finland has a population of five million. That's St. Petersburg alone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're just over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's half the size of New Jersey's population.  Yeah.  So there's.  I saw a video of people at the train station in Finland saying we had to get out.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to make this the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  This weekend.  We can't ignore it.  This weekend, World War III.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I started putting stuff in the rundown and I didn't know what your decision was going to be.  So I put it together down at the bottom and other.  It'll it'll sadly get there where it is kind of other.  But we can't not ignore it for a while.  My happy place in the world, my happy place on Twitter is my book history wonks Twitter list.  Right. Which I go to when all else fails me.  Gutenberg and such.  And it's all Ukraine now, of course, because these are human beings all concerned for the world.  And everything is Ukraine now. Everything.  As it should be right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, even if it's not and you have moments of forgetfulness, which happens on our shows all the time, and then it just it floods back in on you shortly thereafter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week, you did a hell of a lot of stories on the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to. I think we've done enough.  We have plenty of other things we can talk about.  Our hearts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about Google buying Mandian as part of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not related to Russia, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just cybersecurity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to get to that.  Definitely.  I would call that not a Ukraine story.  So if there's certainly cybersecurity is going to be part of what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google makes the pitch that it's more important now than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been talking with Mandiant since before the war.  So the reason I know this is the reason I know this is Mandiant talked to us about advertising about a month ago and then said, hold up.  Hold up on that advertising thing there for just a little just a minute.  And now I think I know why our show today brought to you by streak.

Thank them for their support by using that address.  And that way we get credit. So that's what comes around goes around.  President Biden has signed an executive order that the crypto boys are going excited, are all over about.  They're so excited. I'm not sure why they're excited, but I guess it's at least acknowledgement that crypto exists.  Yesterday, he signed an executive order emphasizing, this is for vice, the US government's commitment to ensuring that virtual assets are developed responsibly and foreshadows the development of a digital dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this make them happy or unhappy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Makes them happy. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the rich dad, poor dad guy, who I didn't know was a Trumpian kind of off the rails, he was going all, they're going to destroy crypto, they're going to take it all over, they're going to make it one federal dollar, and I don't know why I'm quoting him because he's nuts.  Well see, that's the thing.  There's that extreme part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure I buy the interpretation this is good news because you're right.  All it's saying is we're going to look more into this.  But everybody I read said, oh no, this is great.  Vice says industry insiders appear to welcome the executive order, which was expected to be essentially positive on cryptocurrencies.  This is Jerry Brito, director of a DC based think tank coin center.  He tweeted, the message I take from this, guess what kinds of coins?  The message I take from this executive order is that the federal government sees cryptocurrency as a legitimate, serious, and important part of the economy and society.  I think it's a good signal to serious people who've been holding back from getting involved.  One of the things I think people like Jerry are saying is we needed guidance from the feds about this or nobody would take it seriously.  If they're going to do things, at least we'll know what the roadmap is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're validating the technology.  They're saying, hey, this is a thing worth looking at because we think it's a real thing.  And when the federal government does that, even if they come in and squash it, at least they've said, okay.  The next step is going to be not squashing it.  But if they come in and say, okay, we're looking at this, then everybody else is like, oh, the federal government's going to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's partly that, but it's also just we need some certainty.  In fact, there was a cryptocurrency exchange, one of our sponsors actually, that was fined a lot of money by the SEC, but welcomed it because they said, look, we'll pay the fine fine.  What we wanted was clarification.  They've never said, are these securities?  What are these?  The FCC fine essentially said, yeah, if you're trading crypto futures or whatever it was, that's a security and we're going to treat it like a security.  Okay, so they actually, as bad as it is to get fined, welcomed it because now we know what the rules are.  And this is a problem.  What's going to make it hard for it to mature and to get people invested in it is the uncertainty of knowing how the feds are going to come down.  So even if they come down potentially badly, at least we'll know.  We need to know.  And I think that if there is a digital dollar, there are people who would say that's a terrible thing.  Probably the rich dad, poor dad guy, because of course that means maybe no more anonymity and the government's snooping on transactions.  They're really right now, there is really only one completely private transaction.  That's cash, unmarked bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is that the reputation of crypto keeps getting worse and worse.  I put a whole bunch of crypto stuff down under other in the, one of which is a $124 million crypto fraud operation with a brother and sister.  When that kind of stuff goes on, it hurts the reputation of safety of the entire field if they want to make this broad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same thing with NFTs. There's all sorts of scams and I saw somewhere 80% of NFTs are scams.  Yeah, so this needs, it has to stop being the Wild West.  And yeah, if you're Wyatt Earp, you might say, oh man, I'm going to miss those good old days.  But there's no future if you don't get some certainty on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would find it useful, I don't know if you agree or not, because this is not a democracy.  It only matters if you do, to almost discuss crypto a little more often on the show just because it's such an important, crypto and blockchain.  Okay, well, all right, that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who was that?  I'll discuss the blockchain. That was the pained noise of like, oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wow, that was a stuck pig.  Yeah, I know, some animal was. No, I think we should.  Can I get my ringtone please?  Look, I am not, I am increasingly skeptical of all of this stuff.  That's why it's interesting. But the architecture has potential to do things.  Oh, nobody's saying there's not some interesting stuff and blockchain obviously has some applications. It's a decentralized ledger. That's great.  But as it's been implemented through cryptocurrencies and now NFTs and DAOs, it almost always seems to be at best speculative and at worst a scam.  And so I'm very, very bearish on cryptocurrency in general and crypto in general.  But yes, Stacey, and that's why Stacey made that noise. I'm sure she feels the same way.  She doesn't want this to be the crypto bro show.  I do not. I will abandon ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I bring up things that-  A threat. No crypto for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am out of here.  That is not a threat. It's just a legitimate like, nope.  No, you wouldn't want it.  But I promise to y'all, because I follow a lot of this because I do think the blockchain is important for establishing trust.  Trust and authenticity in IoT. I get a lot of interesting pitches around data.  I will bring those to you and I will say, hey, look, this is actually pretty legit. This is pretty cool.  I've done it in the past. I'll continue doing it. But we don't have to talk a lot about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, look, it's not blockchain's legit, but it's not about blockchain.  Otherwise, people would be all excited about MongoDB or the latest YubiKey.  It's if it were just a decentralized ledger database application by itself, no one would want to talk about it.  They want to talk about it because of the huge amounts of money that can be made speculating on currencies that are created by using that technology.  Now. So we can talk about blockchain, but I think blockchain, absent all of that stuff, is about as interesting as talking about Hadoop.  It's just not-  MongoDB is not a distributed database.  No, but I'm saying it's a technology. There's lots of technologies out there.  What's interesting is the utility, the uses.  We don't spend hours talking about public key crypto. Yes, hugely important, valuable, because it was never tied to a $60,000 instrument.  Nobody cares about it. So we talk about all of that stuff all of the time.  I'm just saying that saying it's a good technology is not why people are talking about it. It's not why it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'll bring you the use cases that are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. There's great uses cases for public key crypto too, but that's just technology. That's not why there's all this tension.  And by the way, every time I say this, and I will get it today, I'll get emails and tweets saying, okay, boomer.  But I think Larry David isn't far off on all of this. Let's just put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to say that I am not a boomer. I might even be addressed to Dear GenXer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did not spend hours talking about RSA encryption as useful and positive and beneficial as it is.  The reason we spent all that time talking about blockchain is not because it's a great technology and a distributed ledger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a simple rule. Cervantes didn't say, I need to find a new use for print.  He said, I want to invent something new and it was the novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to create the novel. People talk about print a lot more than they talk about blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, so if we bring up a lot of blockchain issues, are we just going to be tilting at windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, very good. Very good. Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. What else are we going to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have we done all the blockchain we wanted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm like, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I found this fascinating. I found this interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Islamic debate over the permissibility of crypto because in Islam, because they don't allow usury, not usury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Usury, not usury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. There's a Talmudic to misuse it. A debate going on which I found fascinating.  Koranic. Thank you. It's much better. Yes.  A Koranic discussion about whether or not buying into blockchain is a form of usury or is it just something that develops and builds value?  And it's interesting how you take these things and people have to adapt them into their own norms and structures.  So that's just worth mentioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it, is it Sharia? Sharia?  Sharia.  Sharia finance is what I've heard it used or called. If you want to give it the, not Talmudic, but it's Sharia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want to give it the proper affiliation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. So is it trade or is it usury?  I would say it's closer to trade than usury. Usury is borrowing for interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I would say gas is usury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just because it's usurious gas prices doesn't make it usury.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone's complaining about gas prices. Yes, they're high, but good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say that as a Tesla driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's two reasons. It's because I've traveled frequently enough in Europe that I'm like, our gas prices are nothing.  I'm an Ethereum gas.  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you meant gas.  I meant Ethereum gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you were getting off on some weird old man tangent.  I was like, oh, come on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not like that. What's all this about $6 a gallon?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we're not talking about those gas prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a technology show for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was so confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, I'm a Jeff.  It's not been beyond you in the past to bring up non-technology related stories like Cervantes and the novel.  That's legit.  That's legit.  It was technology back then.  Yes, it was. That's the point.  Yes.  In its day, it was technology.  Technology is anything that wasn't invented when you were born.  That's my definition.  So Microsoft's purchase of Nuance just closed with the EU, finally can close after 11 months of regulatory scrutiny.  That's why the Mandiant thing, while interesting, doesn't, you know, we always get the headline, Google to acquire Mandiant, $4.5 billion deal.  But we don't really mention, and that may go through in a year after all the regulators get a hold of it.  And Cory Doctorow is very quick to point out some very good news, I think, on Sunday on Twitter that with Lena Kahn running the FTC and Tim Wu in the White House as an advisor,  we've got some very strong antitrust proponents with the year of the president and with the administration.  And this may in fact not be a very good time to make big deals.  This would be the second largest history, a deal in history for Alphabet.  Trying to think of what the largest would be. Was it Android maybe?  5.4 billion.  4 billion.  Mandiant is a cybersecurity company.  They had FireEye, they bought FireEye, so for a while they were called FireEye, but the Mandiant FireEye, or not just Mandiant.  They publish reports about, we often quote their reports about cyber campaigns.  They are often the ones that identify nation states as involved.  And in fact, the US intelligence agencies, apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, rely on insights provided by Mandiant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you want to know the biggest acquisition?  Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. How much was YouTube? It was like a billion three or something.  Yeah, it was nothing. 5.4 billion.  Why would Google want a cybersecurity company, I guess is the question.  They need something to differentiate their cloud products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gives them, and if you think about it, Microsoft has a huge cybersecurity business. They have their whole forensic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google has Project Zero and Tavis Ormandy, and they have a very good security group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may just be looking at it as the next big thing you need to have to be a cloud or a service provider, an infrastructure provider even.  Yeah. Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, Microsoft was trying to buy it, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wall Street Journal talked to a cybersecurity analyst at the bank Needham Group, Alex Henderson, who said,  who said,  That's their business, by the way, to sell automated cybersecurity tools tailored to cloud-only environments.  He said,  This is big business.  But does Google want to become a security consultant? That's because that's the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's become so much more relevant.  What we're seeing happen, especially with the digital transformation, is that a lot of companies are trying to go get all of their infrastructure and tech expertise in just a few places.  So if you have that consultancy and can offer it, then you can just go all in on Google, right?  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The journal says Mandiant is often called by a company once they realize they've been hacked to mop up and figure out why and how and how not to do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Behind every single hack is a phone call to Mandiant. I'm not kidding.  Anytime you see like Colonial Pipeline, any of these, they call me. No, it's a very well-known name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the question. Does Google want to have this as a business and they charge and this is you call Google Mandiant and they come in?  Or do they want to offer this as value add to their existing cloud business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I assume they'll start just by owning it and offering it.  And then they'll look for ways to integrate it.  But if they're smart, they'll leave it enough alone for a while and then start to bring what they can in-house additive to their own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy, you're inspiring a question.  Isn't this like a transitional point as what IBM went through?  Well, we make computers and then they became a consulting company.  And well, we offer hosting, but we need to offer a whole set of services.  And, you know, I wouldn't, you know, does Google at some point buy a top seven accounting firm, you know, and then they become a business consultant.  It seems like it's on the order of that, right?  It's buying that kind of capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to think of any other business that Google has that is, I mean, because everything else is pretty much automated, even all their ad stuff.  That would be the only place I'm not familiar enough with their business.  You don't bring in Google consultants to help set up your company network or to move you to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe you do.  Maybe that's the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's the way they can grow versus Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe they see it as something they can productize.  Maybe in two years they'll be like, all right, we've learned everything we can from these consultants and now we've turned it into an AI service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that part of this comes from the fact that Google's looking at the fact that there are weak, very low-cost companies?  Yeah, I think that's the weak third in cloud.  It's Amazon, it's Microsoft, and then everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  15 billion security consulting alone.  And Amazon is not, so the only way Google's going to keep up, I think, is by adding those kinds of product lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's what they need to do if they're serious about being in the cloud.  They need to do something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense.  If you take the IBM example, then that's where you end up going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A thousand people in the cloud business, their souls just curdle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, exactly. Oh, exactly. I love it. I love the heresy of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know enough. Maybe somebody in our chat room or on Discord is more familiar with cloud providers and so forth.  But what does Amazon offer along these lines? Does Amazon have a security consultancy? What do they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have a security consultancy to mine.  I mean, they have over 200 something odd cloud products.  So there may be like a secret one that I'm not aware of.  They have started in the IoT side to get the more sophisticated because Amazon has historically been seen as more basic infrastructure or infrastructure for startups and such.  Microsoft, and that's why they're such a big player in the cloud, is because the established big companies go to Microsoft, right?  So to get some of that business over as part of the big companies doing digital transformations, Amazon has started to add some consulting around data analysis and predictive maintenance and optimizing your cloud infrastructure for some of this.  But they don't have anything, to my knowledge, on the security side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, in fact, I'm looking at a list of Amazon security tools for AWS and almost all of them are completely automated.  It's just software running in the background that will tell you Amazon inspector, a security assessment service for applications deployed on AC2.  AWS Shield, fully managed distributed knowledge service protection.  DDoS protection service.  I think we actually use Shield, the web application firewall, all that stuff.  This is all software.  So they must, that's interesting.  And yet they're number one.  So maybe you don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not number, like, it's not mutually exclusive to buy, put your infrastructure on Amazon and then use Microsoft security stuff.  So that's another thought process.  Google is not doing a bang up job being this awesome cloud service provider.  It's number three, right?  Distant number three.  What if it can then come in and say, oh, I'm going to offer a security service that competes more with Microsoft, but you could be an Amazon customer and maybe I'll make it more Google-y, feeling more developer friendly than maybe a Microsoft option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right before the story broke, Mandy actually put out a report saying that the political, I'm sorry, the prolific Chinese hacking group APT-41 had compromised multiple US state government networks.  This is according to Mandy and the group conducted a months long campaign during which it targeted and successfully breached at least six US state networks, all of which have been notified by Mandy, but they did not publish which states.  It's interesting.  You want to know how the hack happened?  There is a software application offered, I think by the Ag department, widely used in many states called USA Herds.  It's an animal health management tool and it used log for shell.  No.  Log for J rather.  So it was vulnerable to log for shell.  According to Mandy, between May 2021 and February of last month of this year, APT-41 used vulnerable internet facing web applications to gain a foothold into state networks, including exploiting a zero day in USA Herds and the log for J logging library.  Mandy said APT-41 began exploiting log for shell within hours of the vulnerability being announced in December of last year.  So there you go.  As soon as there's disclosure, you are vulnerable.  Led to the compromise of two US state government networks and other targets in the insurance and telecoms industries.  After gaining that foothold on the network, APT-41 went on to perform extensive credential collection, which I guess got them into the other networks.  In one instance, they used a SQL injection vulnerability in a proprietary web app.  Wow.  So that's this is nation state hackers.  This is China.  I'm sure Russia is doing the same thing.  But one of the things Mandy and said is while everybody's looking over at Russia, don't forget there are other major threat actors continuing operations as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yikes.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One more second.  One more second.  I'm trying to think as a brand.  Who would you more likely call for consulting if they had the arms?  Google or Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are really terrible options.  Yeah, really.  I trust.  I trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might call IBM or HP.  I would call Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I think is the essence of this.  I think that that's that's you inspired it, Stacey and Leo.  But I think I think that's they may see that it's the missing piece they have to have.  Who are you going to call?  Google.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey on IOT story.  Researchers find potentially vulnerable smart home devices.  Last we're talking about vulnerabilities.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Miss Higginbotham.  Stay salacious.  OK, like where is the stay salacious?  I'm just trying to figure out if Stacey were a nickname for a longer name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a nickname for Anastasia.  Oh, OK.  Is it?  Is that your name?  No.  My name is Stacey.  I was born smack in the Stacey era.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to call you that from now on.  Stacey is this is the nickname for Anastasia.  That's interesting.  Anastasia Higgins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you station name.  That's got to be your novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of so that's your that's your novelist name, Anastasia.  Yeah, she writes murder.  Anastasia W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Higgins.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do enjoy those murder mysteries by Anastasia W.  Higgins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I shall.  I shall keep that in the back burner for when I do my crime series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you going to do one?  I hope you do.  By the way, speaking of which, Stacey does do the Stacey's Book Club in our  Discord.  And the next book is Cory Doctorow's unauthorized bread.  I told Cory he was very thrilled that you're going to do that.  So that's neat.  That's neat.  And John's reading it right now.  Says it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  It's about a toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't pick bad books.  Toaster DRM, baby.  Unauthorized bread.  That'll be a club twit event coming up.  When?  Soon.  Yes.  It's the 24th, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a couple of weeks.  And I will tell you the time as I pull my calendar up.  Oh, it is 9 a.m.  9 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just so you know, Paul Thurotte will be doing a fireside chat on March 31st.  We got Stacey's Book Club, the Untitled Linux Club, Linux show.  These are all things that happen inside the club.  It's an amazing club.  It's really taken off thanks to Ant.  I should have mentioned Ant's not here because it's his birthday.  Happy birthday, Ant.  Happy birthday, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know we don't know how old he is.  We don't know.  We want to know, but we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He told us all to do five squats before breakfast.  No, before lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five I could do.  Five I could do.  Well, yeah, you just got to start.  Yeah, just got to start somewhere.  Thank you, Ant, for doing all of these great events and for doing this, the book club and everything.  And if you are not a member of Club Twitter, that isn't even the main, that's not even the main show.  The main deal is ad free versions of all of our shows.  We thought the Discord will just be, we'll throw something in for fun.  It turned out to be a fabulous place to talk about everything, not just the shows, but all sorts of topics that geeks are interested in.  And it goes, the list goes on and on.  Even Sportball, if you're not a member, seven bucks a month gets you those ad free shows, access to the Discord, the Twit Plus feed, all the extra shows we do inside the club are on that feed.  Just go to twit.tv slash club twit.  Please join Club Twit.  It really helps keep the lights on here at Twit Central, Twit Party Central.  So, oh, oh, Patrick Delahanty is going to be also doing a fireside chat.  He is our engineer.  If you want to know how all this stuff runs, he's the guy who does that.  That's March 17th, St. Patrick's Day, March 24th for the book club, March 31st for Paul Thurotte's AMA.  So it's a very busy March in Club Twit.  How exciting.  Let's take a little break and we'll have more.  Oh, wait a minute. Were we starting to talk about something before that? Yes.  Potentially.  Do you want to talk about my story?  Forget that article. Forget that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked her to summarize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somehow, Anastasia Higginbotham got me off on a tangent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, that's what my alter ego does.  Yes.  Okay. Three years ago, a bunch of researchers launched something called IoT Inspector.  And if you downloaded it, it would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about that when it came out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We did.  And if you downloaded it, it tracked the behavior of smart devices in your home.  And about 5,000 people downloaded it.  They got about a huge database, about 50,000 devices behaving in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the upshot of that. We talked about getting it and using it.  Now we know what the results are and what are the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know so.  I mean, they're using this pool of data for other research.  But this particular research, they looked at it and they said, oh, holy cow.  A lot of these devices or some of these devices are behaving in ways that devices that use older, vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are behaving.  So they can't say that these 32 Amazon devices, these 22 Samsung devices, and the list goes on, are actually using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL because they don't actually know what versions they're using.  This isn't information that's available, but they do behave like vulnerable versions.  And some of these vulnerabilities, they're allow for remote code execution.  And the idea here is they didn't do this to be like, gotcha.  They did it because they're trying to figure out how we make IoT devices transparent and secure in the way that we try to make web browsing transparent and secure using public key encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Public key infrastructure.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it going to require the hardware manufacturers to step up as much as anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So hardware manufacturers are already stepping up.  They're doing like most of these companies, not all, but most of them are starting with like secure by design.  They're also starting programs for like defense and depth and all the good buzzwords.  But what happens is maybe they don't update everything.  Maybe they're just not on top of something.  And nobody knows.  The other thing is like we have certificate authorities on the web.  I didn't realize this, but some companies issue their own IoT device certificates.  They don't even have it.  Oh, self-signed. Yeah, that's not good.  Yeah. So everything's self-signed.  So they're basically, this is basically just them saying like, look, this is an immature ecosystem.  We need to make it more secure.  What are the, let's open up conversations on how we can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This chart is interesting.  You have this in your blog posted at Stacey on IoT.  The number of days that companies ran outdated versions of OpenSSL after, I guess it was Heartbleed.  Was it after the Heartbleed vulnerability?  There is whatever the SSL vulnerability was.  And some waited a long time.  Look at LG. Look here.  LG between a thousand and two thousand days.  Who was the fastest? Samsung is pretty quick.  Synology was pretty quick. Glad to hear that.  That's what I use. QNAP, another network attached storage was probably the quickest.  Amazon patched a lot of stuff, but not all the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some of this could be indications of like little devices they sold like a few of and then like discontinued.  So they're just not thinking about it.  A lot of these are smart TVs.  If you look at these devices, a lot of them look like media storage or smart TVs.  And those are notorious for being kind of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is what I'll go with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The biggest range and maybe it's a measure of how many devices they offer is Google,  which patched some of its devices within just a few days and took several.  It looks like several years to patch the rest of them.  How many? Just two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google only has two devices that were behaving weirdly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so explain this graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're looking. Yeah, it's a complicated.  I was like, there's a lot.  The devices, the number of devices that are affected are in parentheses.  Oh, there they are too. I see. I see. Yeah, I see. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon had to give you some sense.  Thirty two devices that were affected.  This brand that's device lines, I guess we should say Samsung twenty two device lines.  So, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in there, they're going to continue using this pool of data for other research.  So, you know, we I note in there if you want to, you can.  It's not something you should run all the time because it does kind of slow down your Internet speeds because it's using deep packet inspection.  But, you know, running it occasionally and having it really valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Thanks to those of you who did that so that we can see some of this information.  There is an attack on Amazon's Echo devices.  It's a little bit, you know, I was thinking about how could this.  This is OK. But wait a minute.  I was so the way it works is you have to be within range of the Echo so that you can shout, pair with my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can happen to an Apple Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, once I'm paired, once my phone is paired to your device, then I have control of the device.  Do what? To give you the wrong weather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, to tell you to unlock the doors or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a stupid attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, I thought it was. Then I thought about it.  You know who should worry about this? People in apartments with thin walls.  Yes, that's what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is something for people in apartments or possibly hotel rooms, maybe, because they are putting Amazon Echoes in hotel rooms.  So if you had someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you need to be in voice range initially for the initial attack and then Bluetooth arranged the rest of the time.  So but if you had a thin wall and you could experiment with your neighbor shout, Echo, what's the weather going to be like?  And if it responds and you know that he is vulnerable and then if you have an Echo, so are you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I'm like. Or if you hear endless fart jokes, then you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, that's that's more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that the hacker is a teenage boy.  Yes. Or a five year old child or the host of a podcast called This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Now I'll do the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what tangent we went off to while we went off to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It started with an it started with Stace Alicia's and then Anastasia and then and then it went down and then it was the Stacey's Book Club.  And then I did an ad for the club twit.  And then anyway, it's just, you know, that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is your middle initial squirrel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Squirrel L.  And my middle name is Lynn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anastasia L. Higginbotham.  Perfect name.  I thought W was better.  I thought W is pretty good because you want more syllables.  More syllables. Yeah. More syllables. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, dear.  Lisa came very close, very close to sending you our word.  I'll score from last night.  But I said no.  Jeff would hit the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa. What did I do to you, Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said we should send this to Jeff.  All right.  Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY and Buzz Machine.  And have you been on MSNBC lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't know what I said.  They haven't had me on in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the war, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've been on Pandemic.  Yeah, used to be on all time.  Like every like every white male on the Internet, I am an epidemiologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, you have opinions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me explain COVID to you ladies.  I'm now an expert in flyover zones and diplomacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, Stacey Higginbotham, who's a very legitimate expert in all things chips.  Were you impressed? Did you follow at all the Apple announcement yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was. I follow some of it.  I had to get on a plane. I was just blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can the captain hold off?  They haven't announced the phone yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm hearing something about an interconnect secret feature.  I don't know how secret was, but it's true.  I had not read about it.  That was in the Apple processors.  The Apple silicon processors that allowed them to do a high speed interconnect with other chips.  Now up to other dies up to now, there's only been one die in all the Apple silicon devices.  But now with these new Apple studio devices, there are two die on the ultra anyway.  And the interconnect is apparently very, very fast.  I can't remember the numbers they gave, but it was something several hundred gigabytes.  No terabytes.  It was two and a half terabytes a second of data over these interconnects, which is incredibly fast.  And at this point, it feels like in chip design, Apple is starting to leave everybody in the dust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, memory bandwidth was our big issue.  And Apple is just like, they're like, let's buy some chip firms.  Let's hire some people.  And then like two years later, they're like, bam, we've changed that we have changed everything.  It's really impressive.  Yeah.  Go Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I mean, in a way, I'm I'd say go Apple because we can buy Apple products, but I'd love to see Intel, AMD and Nvidia and others say, OK, OK, OK, we'll do that too.  But they have been trying to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they really have.  It's not like they weren't solving for this problem.  It's just that Apple solved better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, has done a really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, they also do a really good job marketing.  I mean, nobody nobody tunes into Nvidia's.  No, no, I do.  We did.  We did.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, we covered it last year anyway, and I probably covered it again this year.  It's the next month, I think.  But you're right.  It's not doesn't get the attention that Apple doesn't get the love and the cool graphics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Nvidia's last thing was cool.  You know why?  Because they did it all in VR.  Right.  Or AR or magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, we found out that even after the fact, even their CEO was imaginary.  I love it.  For a couple of minutes, not for the whole talk.  No, we followed that.  I thought that was very interesting.  I'm really excited about Nvidia, what they're doing with AIs and cars as well as gaming.  They really have found a way to use these GPUs in very exciting ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wanted to put them on the cover of Fortune in 2015.  But they said no, it's too new.  No, it's too nerdy.  You were smart.  But 2017, they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, here's some good news.  And I wouldn't call this greenwashing at all.  Tesla's just announced, you know, remember that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX was going  to send Starlink terminals to Ukraine.  Now Tesla has announced they're sending power walls to Ukraine and expanding the supercharger  network for Tesla's.  And...  Plug in your tank.  Yeah, and giving up to three months of pay to employees going back to work.  So I don't know what that has to do with Ukraine.  Power walls, you may mock that, I did.  But in a way, if you're worried about inconsistencies in power generation, having a big old battery  in your house is, you know, possibly valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have some way to charge it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, did we do that?  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was old as an adult too, and it passed by and I didn't notice.  At least you had the courage to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm running, I'm like, okay, go get a snack.  Go get a snack, Stacey.  And then I'm like, they're talking about Elon Musk.  I'm like, okay, hold on.  No, just throw in some in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like to throw in little tidbits here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I zoned out on Twitter so effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all a strategy to keep people from skipping the ads.  If you don't know where the ad began, where the ad ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just ruined it, Stacey.  You just ruined the illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just going to keep it going because you might miss something good like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, my quest for snacks, I'm like, wait, no, come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a bunch of people who are coming back from their snack break.  And guess what?  It's time for the ad.  Our show today brought to you by Codecademy.  Love Codecademy.  You want to change your career?  There's never been a better time to be a coder.  I'm a hobbyist, but I think it's so great.  It's such a fun thing to do, to write code.  And maybe you've thought, I'd like to know more about this.  I talk to people all the time saying, boy, I think I might like coding.  Well, here's how you find out.  Learn to code in your own terms with Codecademy.  You won't be alone.  Over 50 million people already know that Codecademy is the best way to learn to code  because Codecademy not only teaches you job ready coding skills, it also, this is really important,  helps you build unique projects for your portfolio, earn certificates you can put on your LinkedIn page,  even prep for technical interviews, everything you need to get a job doing something you love.  Coding.  Oh, man, it's so cool.  One of the things I love about Codecademy, and by the way, I just do their classes for fun,  but I took some Python classes there, for instance.  I keep trying to get better at Python, is you're coding from the very first day.  You're the interface with Codecademy.  You start typing some code, you press submit or run, I guess, and then it tells you, did you?  Nope, that's not it.  Here's what you need to work on.  So you're actually getting instant feedback right from day one.  You can learn at your own pace.  There's no hurry.  Perfect for me because I'm kind of, you know, I'm a casual coder.  But if you're in a hurry to get a job and qualify for in-demand jobs, you can do it as fast as you want,  as fast as you need.  You can choose what to learn from building basic websites to artificial intelligence, everything in between.  And it doesn't matter if you've never done any coding before.  You'll be writing real working code in minutes.  And if you're a pro, you could start at a level that's appropriate to you and get even better at it.  Look at the list of languages.  Go to Codecademy.com, just see.  But of course, Python and, you know, if you want to be a full stack coder, you'll need HTML, CSS.  You probably need SQL, JavaScript.  Those are the most popular right now, but there's a lot of languages there.  If you're not sure where to begin, don't worry.  In fact, Lisa and I did this for fun.  There's a programming personality quiz on the site that you could take.  It's not asking you coding questions or about, you know, math ability.  It's asking what you like, what you're interested in, how you think.  And it will then tell you what track would be the best tailored career advice  and which courses you should take based on your interests and your strengths.  And it was exactly right on, I have to tell you, for both me and Lisa.  It said, oh, you need to do a computer science track.  Lisa, you need to do statistics.  It suggested I do, I think, learn Python.  It suggested Lisa learn R, which is a statistics language.  It was really right on. It was very interesting.  Get instant feedback. Your code will be tested as soon as you submit it.  You always know if you're on the right track.  But don't worry, there's lots of help there as well.  You're not on your own by any means.  It's a completely interactive platform, but you learn by doing.  And build that portfolio. Very important.  Get that certificate of completion.  You will be much more marketable to future employers.  And then you can land your dream job in web development or programming  or computer science or data science and tons more.  If you want to learn a new skill to build websites,  to troubleshoot tech issues, to transition into a new career,  this is where you go. Codecademy.com.

Okay, we're back with Jeffrey Jarvis, Anastasia Higginbotham.  All fully, you're fully fed.  You're not going to pass out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of fed, but yes.  Did you see me shoving my crackers in my mouth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. I give you complete privacy.  Privacy.  While you're eating like a pig.  John sees it all, but not I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no trough, y'all. It's just rapid fire crunching.  I try to mute too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if you want, I could take more time on those ads  and give you a little more time. I don't want you to rush.  I don't want you to rush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, really, how much time do we have?  Because most food requires a little bit more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, crackers. I'm disappointed. I was hoping waffles at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The waffles take six minutes to toast.  You should have a toaster in your office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cacio e pepe only takes seven minutes.  So, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I could be eating, but then the pasta would be super messy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to mention the slurping.  It's just ASMR right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know, remember when...  People pay good money for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy slurps.  It's a new show on the Twitter network.  Amazon. Remember when...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Slurpy hippy-gabotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slurpy hippy-gabotham.  Anastasia slurpy-higginbotham.  A group of...  Remember the testimony?  All the CEOs came to talk to the House Committee about data and all that stuff.  The Judiciary Committee. Jerry Nadler.  We have stupid questions.  David Cicilline. Yeah, you remember that?  Well, a letter comes from the Committee to the Department of Justice today, urging it.  We urge you to open an investigation into air pollution.  We urge you to open an investigation into Amazon and its executives for criminal obstruction of Congress.  What could this be?  The group contends Amazon is engaged in a pattern and practice of misleading conduct, lying to Congress,  in response to our questions about its private label practices and its collection of third-party seller data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you bring in Walmart and great Atlantic and Pacific tea company in this film about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Amazon has not only enshrined this process, but it's part of their business strategy is to harvest this data and take advantage of it.  As it was for every retailer before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From Macy's to Walmart to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know they got more data, but Macy's has data too online now and Walmart.  So it's a practice of retailing since time immemorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't have all those generic brands on the grocer's shelf if they didn't know that you wanted to buy those products.  Lawmakers have zeroed in, claiming Amazon made false and misleading statements to the House Committee about its practices.  I remember Jeff Bezos saying things like, well, that would be illegal if they did that.  I don't think they did that. Let me check.  Apparently, after the fact, they refused to turn over evidence that would either corroborate its claims or correct the record.  So if you're going to assert, no, no, no, no, we tell them you can't do that.  And they didn't do that. And if they did, they did it against orders.  But you need to prove that.  According to the letter, Amazon appears to have done so to conceal the truth about its use of third party sellers data to advantage its private label business and its  preferencing of private label products and search results, which were the subject of the committee's investigation.  Signed by Jerry Nadler, David Cicilline, Ken Buck, Matt Gates and Pramila Jayapal.  There's an interesting bedfellows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're agreeing with Matt Gates, what does that tell you?  Just think for a second. What does that say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they sent it to the DOJ. Now it's up to Merrick Garland and the department to decide whether to prosecute or not and who to prosecute and all that stuff.  There is no guarantee of prosecution, we should point out.  Right.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just saying, we're Congress, you lied to us.  You lied to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's all that clear that they were lied to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they were. This is basically their effort to say, look, we asked this, we're serious, we want to know, and you can't just up, I can say that word, obfuscate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obfuscate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obfuscate.  Obfuscate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lawmakers pointed to, quote, credible investigative reporting, thanks journalists, from Reuters, the Markup, and the Wall Street Journal that directly contradicts testimony from Bezos and other executives.  Wall Street Journal.  Yeah, regardless of that, there is that fundamental question, what did Amazon do that's so very different from what grocery stores have been doing for the last century?  The grocery store knows exactly how much tuna fish you buy, and if they think it's worth it for them to have a can of generic tuna fish to put on the shelf next to the chicken of the sea, they're going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could argue that because Amazon, I mean, you could also argue that some grocery stores now have this, but Amazon sells what, 50% of e-commerce here in the US.  Right.  Which then means that you don't have other alternatives to bring your goods to market, so you have to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the better argument for you, Stacey, I think, on your side of this question, is, playing devil's advocate, trying to be Leo for a minute, is if I search for Pellegrino and you do a really good job of serving me,  and the bubbles, then it's at that point that it could be an unfair use of the data about you as an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Brad Stone's book, Amazon Unbathed, which is very good, by the way, the successor to The Everything Store, the first book he wrote about Amazon, he talks about this specific issue, and about at least, for some of the time, Amazon's very clear instruction.  They said, interestingly, we'll get in trouble if you share data between the private, you know, our stores and Church and State.  And they knew that that was a potential problem, that there were some executives who wanted to do it, who thought it would be just fine, but they had decided in this book, and I wish I had the book with me, I'd look up the passage, but they decided, according to Brad Stone, no, yeah, we better not do that.  But there were executives who were cowboys who said, no, no, no, this is too valuable, we got to do this.  So there was a debate over it anyway. Interesting, they saw that as potentially problematic. They did not choose the Jeff Jarvis defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have thrown those guys under the bus with Congress, and then Congress wouldn't have an excuse for, you know, calling for the Justice Department to intervene, but Amazon was like, eh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Jeff tried to, I mean, essentially, he said, well, if we did, that would be wrong. We don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you do actually, in that case, you do have to follow up.  You have to find somebody to take the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could do that, but that would be wrong.  That would be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be wrong.  I guess, is it more harmful to consumers that Amazon does it than the ANP did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, because Amazon is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of the issues, I think, for Congress is that Amazon recommends what, you know, when you search for a product, it says Amazon Essentials, and then it also says Amazon's best suggestion.  And it's never been clear how you qualify for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's that. So, yes, the Amazon recommends is a huge problem.  The other problem is that a lot of companies can't go to market without Amazon, and Amazon actually has programs to pull these kinds of products in, and then it kind of scours their data and then is like, oh, this is interesting.  Let's make one.  So there's many levels of what I think most normal people would recognize as unethical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Potential problems.  Potentially problematic.  Well, it's not unethical.  Or, you know, look at what is Congress looking for, harms to consumers, right?  Or harms to competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no. So, Lena Kahn, as we've talked about, is really shifting the conversation from harms to consumers, which no one can argue Amazon does because consumers can buy so much more stuff, much more cheaply.  To harms to society, harms to labor, harms to competitors in the market, harms to startup and innovation.  We talked about this a couple of weeks ago with the FTC putting out their request for, it's not a request for proposal.  What is it?  They did a memorandum that was basically like, should we look into all of this?  Right.  And that's the crux of this because Amazon built their entire parcel of unethical behaviors around, yeah, we're fine because we're making cheaper things for consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, from the consumer's point of view, I just did a search for disc soap.  One of the things I always liked about Amazon, it will show me a variety of products and something that you could find in the stores, but it's hard, the cost per ounce, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, let's talk about pricing because Amazon doesn't show me and you the same pricing and that pricing changes several times a day.  And that's another issue where as companies like Amazon and Walmart's doing this too, I mean, it's not that particular issue is not only Amazon's issue.  We're seeing a lot less transparency around pricing that is really going to hurt consumers in the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's where that will bite them if it turns out that there's a bias in that pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it may not because they've gotten so big.  There's not like a lot of opportunities for me to find alternatives.  And that's what's really interesting because they've squeezed out a lot of those alternatives at the moment.  And if I were an alternative and I had something cheaper than Amazon in a way to do it, I'd probably have to go through Amazon to sell it to the wider market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm also saying, Stacey, that if once you decide to do variable pricing, if you're not careful, if you end up charging poor black people more than poor Latino people, I don't think that people more than whatever, then you better be careful about how the algorithm.  So, Stacey, you said that you don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said that at any given time, different people see different prices.  Is that the case or just that the pricing varies, but we all see the same thing at any given time?  I think it's more that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's the price can vary both.  It can vary across geographic regions.  Well, that might make sense.  That would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if it's offering Stacey a deal that it's not offering me, that would be really wrong.  So that happens though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  That does happen.  Did you not?  The New York Times did a story actually documenting this not too long ago, like a week ago.  Differential pricing is probably what you should Google.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a hand soap, because I know that Amazon sells its own brand of liquid hand soap.  The Amazon choice is actually from a competitor, Softsoap, right next to theirs, Solomo, which is half the price.  So you might say, well, that may be Amazon's choice, but I'm going to buy Amazon's brand.  They also have a best seller indicator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so let's wait here.  Let me do this.  Let me go to liquid hand soap.  Search for liquid hand soap.  I just did.  I get different results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my first result was Softsoap Moisturizing Hand Liquid, $7.74 for a six pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine is Dove Nourishing Foaming Hand Washer, $14.88.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell?  I don't see Dove on here at all.  Wait, is yours?  Mine's very expensive too.  OK, no, I go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show me your screen again, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Liquid hand soap.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so you're right under the results.  So mine is, so my first result is sponsored.  It's Evolved by Nature Liquid Hand Soap Refill.  Then it's the second one.  How much, Stacey?  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get that too.  That's sponsored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And my Amazon, I mean, next one is featured from our brands, which is not sponsored, but also feels a little weird.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whose is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whose is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that is, that's Amazon brand Solanil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much is your Solanil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For?  I get a 32, a two pack of 32 fluid ounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny, I see a two pack of 56 ounce.  They must think my hands are dirtier than yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm getting charged 10 cents of fluid ounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, as in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, I get the same soft soap you have under Amazon's Choice.  Yes.  Then I get highly rated.  For $14.88?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Six pack of six.  I mean, this is obviously so anecdotal, it's not useful.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also interesting.  How do you say what's the prime position here, except for what's on top top is aromatic, aromatherapeutic hand care products?  It means they don't know.  Yeah, it's a home brand.  I hate aromatherapy.  I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's an advertisement.  And I don't, I for some reason not getting it maybe because I have an ad blocker running.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have the sponsored results as results and on the far right is a sponsor.  That's the Dove and the Evolved.  Then Amazon's Choice and then highly rated and then more results.  I don't even have highly rated.  So what's the prime position in all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The top line is obviously the prime position, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't, I mean, so I hate it.  I don't even have highly rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's also sold.  That's sponsored.  That's why Amazon now has a bigger advertising business than newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So mine, how do I know if it's sold?  Wouldn't it?  Is there no indicator that it's sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're interesting.  Mine it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, mine I get a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that must be my ad blocker.  That's a sponsor on the far right.  Yeah, that's my ad blocker I guess.  Yeah, that must be your.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because my results.  Sort by featured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can also sort by price.  Maybe I wouldn't have the same issues if I searched by price.  High to low, low to high, average customer view.  Actually, that's often how I will search for this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the soft soap.  What was yours?  What was your lowest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Low price.  You know, soft soap aloe vera, nine oh four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seven point five ounces.  Yeah.  Okay.  Price difference.  Mine is ten eighty three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Mine has a line through ten eighty three.  It shows me nine oh four.  For some reason, I do see the ten eighty three.  But it's crossed out maybe because I'm a special person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine says only one left in stock.  Let's fight for it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine says I could buy two and save two percent.  That's the one I know is a lie.  Only one left in stock when you see stuff like that.  That's that I know is made up.  Let me see if I see it.  No, that doesn't say anything about that.  But wait a minute.  No, see this ships from Herb.  Herb's pro.  See, that's the other thing is this is a third party.  This is not an Amazon.  You can't tell that from the front page.  Well, because you can recognize it's an app.  Well, but if it's sold by Amazon, is it always prime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not everything is prime.  I mean, they've got some of this stuff, but.  And could you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, see, this is ships from Amazon by sold by Health and Wellness and it is prime.  So you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's actually bought from someplace else.  That's not even.  Right.  But so this is one of the like I don't shop for things as much on Amazon.  And like I shop very little for him on Amazon anymore because I can't because it's like going into like the dollar store or like TJ Maxx or it really is.  It's it's cluttered.  It's confusing.  I'm not feeling like I'm getting not even the best deal, just a fair deal on stuff.  It's so hard to say in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Amazon police are going to come and get you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if you go to the Amazon front page, though, you might be hard pressed to figure out what exactly their business is.  I'm being offered their gaming service, Luna, the marvelous Mrs.  Mays, El and some various sundries, including some headphones, some books from Kindle.  It's a big shopping for hand soap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to get so much hand soap.  Oh, no, no.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's a toilet seat.  I don't know.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why that and a stethoscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they know I want an office chair or a desk.  And then this is the new thing, by the way, these shop live streams.  Have you ever watched these?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My friend used to do them for in.  She would do them for Chinese goods.  These are great.  Oh, he's he's signing.  How cool is?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at that set, though.  Wow.  Very little LED lights on the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are those are not brand name LED lights in the background right there.  I'm just going to tell you that right now.  Yeah.  Those are knockoff LED lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people watch these.  Sounds like you do.  It's a big trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a huge shopping trend.  So Amazon's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look how many shopping channels we have on TV.  After all these years at Capitamonte, there's like five channels on my cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if I were going to do an Amazon live shoppable live stream?  What should I sell?  Because it's got to be something the people who would watch me.  Thermomix.  Thermomix.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Substack has an RSS reader.  You miss Google reader today.  Substack.  Here's Hamish McKenzie saying we're launching an app for Substack.  Using it makes me feel like a reader again.  It's where I read my favorite writers at their best.  I love it.  Good news, bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only an app, not web and only Apple, not Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who gets the maybe the bigger question is who gets on that app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their stuff is there.  So you read it, but you can add it.  They say you can add any RSS feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, by going to reader.substack.com.  But you have to use the app.  But you have to use the app, but you can add it online.  Okay.  Okay.  So it is open in that sense.  Although they figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, harvesting as much data as they can through an app instead of on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  I asked Dave Weiner what he thought of it and he said, kind of like, it's an app.  I don't really use that.  Then everybody was asking Dave.  He said, why is everybody asking me this?  Because you're RSS, Dave.  You're the man.  We depend upon you.  So he had some thoughts.  I'm trying to find what it was then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silenced No More.  The second Washington state, your state is now the second state in the union to pass the Silence No More Act.  Just take a guess.  What does that do?  Silenced No More.  I cheated.  I don't know.  Thank you for being honest, Jeff.  It bans employers in the state, California is the other state, from using NDAs to prevent workers from talking about instances of illegal harassment and discrimination, retaliation, sexual assault and wage violations, which seems to me should be a federal law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it should be.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is in response to Sheriff Scarlett, who was the Apple employee who kind of was a whistleblower on Apple, saying they basically silence you if you want to talk about any of this stuff.  So it is no longer illegal to force employees to sign a nondescript non-disclosure act.  I should say what NDA is, it's a non-disclosure act.  Or often it's also a nondisparagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, nondisparagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not unusual.  When people quit, we will say, okay, we're fired.  We'll give you termination.  We'll give you severance if you sign an agreement not to say bad things about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't sign the Managed Interest Contract at Time Inc.  And as a result, I quit.  You need to get your severance.  Three years salary, bonus and benefits.  I gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as a result, have you been have you been disparaging them freely ever since?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I am finally writing the story of EW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, now there's an interest now that it's gone.  Yeah, I know.  Yesterday was International Women's Day.  Nice that you have a day of your own, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Apple took it to heart.  I don't know if you noticed.  Well, you didn't because you were at the airport.  But a lot of women presenters, in fact, when they talked about the creators using the new hardware, they were all women.  And I think that's very conscious on Apple's part.  They're very aware of this.  This is the gender pay gap bot.  Or maybe I should say the gender pay gap bot on Twitter.  Pay gap app at pay gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use some hyphens in there, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  It was my fault. My fault.  Gender pay gap bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what they do is I don't know where they got the data from exactly.  But for every company that put up a, hey, yeah, International Women's Day, bot puts up the differential for women.  That's awesome.  Then you see the companies deleting the original tweet to get out of one after another, after another, after another.  Oh, brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's a group of Housing 21 as part of our International Women's Day program of events.  Blah, blah, blah.  In this organization, according to gender pay gap bot, the women's median hourly pay is 31% lower than men's.  Ra-Ra, Cis Bumba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's British data.  Clearly it's British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fascinating.  Yeah, clearly it's British.  Tata Steel.  On occasion of International Women's Day 2022, we celebrate.  And our best wishes in this organization, women's median hourly pay, it's not too bad.  Only 4.6%.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some that's actually better than others.  Leeds City College is only 3.1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the companies cleared themselves out, but it's brilliant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the Intellectual Property Office, UK, 30% disparity.  Good for you, gender pay gap bot.  Job well done.  And happy International Women's Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Information can be a weapon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very powerful.  Very powerful.  And for some reason, still to this day, putting it on Twitter seems to have some real effect.  I never will understand why, but if you want to complain...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's implementing norms.  I mean, we talked about that earlier in the show.  I think Twitter is a great place to police social norms.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody wants to be disparaged on Twitter.  That's where you should do your disparagement.  Now that you sacrificed years worth of vacation pay, you should really get something for that.  It doesn't pay anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vacation pay, hell, it was full three years salary.  How could you give that up?  Because I was a young schmuck.  That's a lot of money.  Salary, bonus and benefits.  You said, I want the right to disparage you guys.  Do the penny.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, because Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be wrong for journals to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you regret that now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this age, yeah.  At the time, I was kind of proud of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all right.  You would have spent it on cigars and hot women.  It would have been wasted.  I was buried.  Oh.  I'm sorry that I said that, Stacy.  You would have spent it on a house.  That's right, for your children to live in.  Reid Hoffman has co-founded his first new company since his sale of LinkedIn.  He made...  Well, I don't know how much he made.  He sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for $26 billion six years ago.  After a few years spending a billion here, a billion there, maybe you want to do something  else.  He's going to start a new company called Inflection that will aim to develop AI software  products to make it easier for humans to communicate with computers.  But what's, in my opinion, most interesting is his partner, DeepMind co-founder Mustafa  Suleyman and former DeepMind researcher Karen Somonyan.  So some pretty heavy hitters working on this.  What would you do to make computers easier for humans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really good question.  Take instructions?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, taking instructions in natural language is one.  But think about what people don't realize is programs often have...  The logic has to be fully thought out.  So if I'm communicating with a computer, I do have to still think out my logic for the  steps, right?  If I want something different to happen, I have to figure out the information I need  to put in to get the result I want.  And that's really where the challenge is.  I mean, yes, coding is hard just from a, oh, it's another language, but it's also hard  because you have to think through what you're actually trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to be very precise.  In fact, that's exactly what Suleyman said in a conversation with CNBC on Monday.  If you think about the history of computing, we've always been trying to reduce the complexity  of our ideas in order to communicate them to a machine.  Even when we write a search query, we're simplifying or reducing or writing in short  hand so that the search engine can understand what we want.  You know, I was thinking about Wolfram Alpha, which does often does a very good job of kind  of intuiting what you're trying to get at.  In fact, it'll even tell you its logic, which is great.  But I guess there's even more we could do.  I was trying to, you know why I was trying the other day to match gas prices, not Bitcoin  gas prices, gasoline prices, petrol, petrol.  Thank you.  Now we know why we call it petrol to presidents because somebody said, well, see what happened.  You elect Joe Biden and the gas goes through the roof.  And I thought, well, if I could only have a graph correlating gas price to a president  and adjusted for inflation, adjusted for inflation.  Well, let me see if I can present.  It didn't work.  President adjusted for inflation.  I think it would do that naturally.  All right, let's see.  And then Wolfram Alpha says, well, first of all, when you say gas price, I'm assuming  you mean gasoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not not.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  See?  And then asks.  And then it does have the all grades of gasoline average price per gallon history in the United  States.  It's good going back to 1993 all the way up through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go back to the 70s.  It would be as high then and now.  Right.  Because of the Arab oil embargo.  Right.  Which was my first big story as a cub reporter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jimmy Carter lines, lines, lines, lines.  But unfortunately, the presidents have just ignored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You extend the timing before the 90s.  Yeah, that seems annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it tell you the source of the data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  It has all sorts of I love if you've not played with Wolfram Alpha, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wolfram is a big part of the von Neumann book.  Yeah, because I'm not surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, super genius man is an editor, but super genius.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because I found out.  Do you know how he writes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just dictates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find this.  He posted a blog post on his work, his workflow.  Oh, God.  Seeking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to have to edit him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you?  Oh, good.  Well, you'll enjoy this.  This is from his blog, stevenwolfram.com.  Seeking the productive life, some details of my personal infrastructure.  There he is.  Apparently he spends a lot of time on Zoom.  But he's got a standing desk.  Okay.  Oh, look, he's on a treadmill while he's working.  Okay.  Now, this is why I think he might be prolix.  He's apparently he writes while he's walking as well.  He's got a little, he's got a little, he's got a little, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  It's like a little cigarette girl's setup.  He's got a table, a stand for his laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he's also got a microphone on.  So he's apparently he's also dictating or talking on the phone.  And he calls it his popcorn rig.  And so he gets his walks in.  But, you know, if you've got a long walk, you might as well keep writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that fits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really I just I don't know why, but that's stuck in my mind.  This I've always I'll never forget this picture.  Wolfram, Stephen Wolfram in the woods.  He's a physicist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a nerd, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought he was a mathematician, but he might be both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know he does it all.  He does it all.  He's got if you read this, it is fascinatingly nerdy.  He said I used to fill up a banker's box with filed papers every couple of months.  Now it takes a couple of years.  I have a printer on my desk.  So he's got these little slots.  He has an array of drawers with a little hack.  There's a slot at the top that allows me immediately slide things into the drawer without opening it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that would waste these five nanoseconds of free time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you need this, Jeff.  I think you need this.  Anyway, just yeah, but brilliant.  Brilliant.  Very interesting fellow.  Did he also write a cookbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's done a lot of he apparently wrote a nifty IOT data store for his nifty software.  Of course.  I'm like, look at that.  I wrote that forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know I we had him on our.  Yeah.  Did he write for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was a guest editor at GigaOm.  So are you asking like why I was the editor or how as in how did I make him short?  I actually for years.  Well, for a hot second, I was the managing editor at GigaOm and I hated it.  And then I had to shed that job piece by piece.  So for like two years, I edited and commissioned our guest columns.  It was the worst time of my life.  But he was a friend of the site.  So he would always share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we're probably best buds.  Here's the glasses he found that help keep him from getting car sick.  Oh, my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a really good dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's super cool.  He's the coolest guy ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you I had to edit him on the phone.  You could not just send him edits or you could.  But you were going to end up having to talk to him.  So we would end up we would end up talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did you fight back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He didn't ever fight back.  He like all really smart people who know what they're doing.  He hated any generalizations that I had to make to make things readable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're dumbing it down.  You're dumbing it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we went back.  I mean, and he respected that.  But he also, you know, it pained him.  And I get it.  I mean, I'm a nerd.  It pains me to see things dumbed down.  But you got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you're as brilliant as Stephen Wolf from I think you need to dumb it down for most of us.  Very interesting fellow anyway.  How do we get there?  Gas prices.  I'm doing it back rolling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no code, low code from DeepMind and you know, getting making your queries less sophisticated,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  making the computer smarter about understanding what you want, that kind of thing.  And Reid Hoffman's gonna be working on.  Oh, I you know what I didn't say?  Who is Reid Hoffman?  He was the founder of LinkedIn and is widely like the founder of LinkedIn.  He's widely revered.  The guy who created the term blitz scaling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Full disclosure is that Reid gave us the funding to start our engagement journalism degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Thank you, Reid.  Yeah.  Big security flaw affecting Linux, which includes, by the way, Android.  Terrible name, dirty pipe.  It allows an attacker to do privilege escalation so they can get root.  And because it's a Linux flaw and it's in the Linux kernel, it affects not only Android,  but in Chromebooks, but Chromecasts, speakers, and of course, desktop computers.  Fortunately, because Android devices use actually a fairly old version of the kernel,  it's not a problem immediately.  Only devices that started with Android 12 are recent enough to have it be an issue.  Presumably, it is being patched as we speak.  There are no known exploits in the wild yet of dirty pipe,  but it is considered by many to be the worst Linux exploit yet.  Google is releasing an open source harassment filter for journalists.  What is a harassment filter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually forget. I put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called Harassment Manager.  Here it is on GitHub.  Online abuse and harassment silence important voices in conversation.  Harassment Manager is a web application that aims to empower users to document and take action on abuse.  So it won't actually block abuse.  You'll see it, but you can take action. You can report them.  It's designed for anyone that experiences significant online harassment,  which can be episodic or an ongoing challenge.  The tool has been built and tested using a community-based research and design process  with active Twitter users, the most harassed group in the world,  that experience significant and or frequent harassment.  Target users include folks who are disproportionately impacted by online harassment,  women, other marginalized groups, journalists, activists, and politicians.  Oh, this comes out of Jigsaw.  Jigsaw, yeah.  Neat.  OK, that should have been in the changelog. That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, do we have a changelog? Is it time for the changelog?  It's time for the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a free one, but we got more.  We got more. 12L is now 12.1 and it's rolling out to Pixel phones.  The 12L tablet hardware coming out by the end of the year.  That was kind of the focus, I think, of 12L was tablet.  But Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, 4A, 5, and 5A will get 12L.  Weirdly, the Pixel 6 will not get an update yet later this month.  I've been running the beta of 12L on my 6 Pro and it's fine.  In fact, I've never had any problems with my Pixel 6, so I'm a weirdo.  Anyway, 12L. It's here, it's time.  We call this release 12.1, says Google, because that's what makes the most sense.  12.1 is the version Google uses on the factory image page.  In blog posts, they're still calling it 12L.  If you open your phone's about page, you'll find a third name under the Android version, Android 12.  Not L, not .1, just plain old Android 12.  So Google hasn't even figured out what the name is.  But one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should have just a running thread. Things Google still needs to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, it would be too long.  There is a March Pixel feature drop, though, which many of us will be getting.  I checked last night and haven't gotten it yet.  It was released on Monday, but I guess with all of these, as with all of these, it's kind of a staged rollout.  If you have a Pixel phone, you're going to get some additional updates.  The improvements are designed primarily for folding phones, tablets and other large screen devices.  But Google's adding more functionality to live caption, which is, I think, a great feature.  Now, when you're on a phone call, you can see captions of what the other person says and type back a response that will be read out loud on the other end, like a TTY for deaf people.  Very interesting.  So if you're on the train or the bus and you don't want to have a phone call out loud, you can do it completely over text.  In effect, text messaging.  Love that idea. And of course, if you're deaf, also great.  The new feature drop also adds support for night sight in Snapchat.  There's a new moon icon in the Snapchat camera.  This is Google working hand in hand with Snapchat to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snapchat hosts on Google Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're apparently good customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's weird that they're doing something for an app.  They get dedicated. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that and it's only for Pixel owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, it's not the first time the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro shipped with a quick tap to snap feature.  You may remember YouTube watch parties and live sharing functionality for duo also in the March feature drop.  Weirdly, the March feature drop first arrived on the Galaxy S22 series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Emoji and sticker suggestions while typing in Gboard, a new interpreter mode in Google Translate activated with Hey, you know who?  Be my Spanish interpreter.  Paint me like your French ladies and for a new battery widget that shows the status of connected devices.  So there you go.  The the March feature drop coming soon to a pixel near you and a Samsung S22.  Actually, they're previewing to June pixel drop already on Android 12 QPR 3 beta 1.  Google kills another fabulous Google thing you never used.  Book on Google for hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was always terrible.  The reason no one used it is because the prices were high and you could never it was always in advance.  You could never do it like the day of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this like they wanted to be Expedia or hotels?  Yeah, it was. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was frustrating because you'd be like, oh, is this available?  And they'd be like, well, it's too soon to tell because, you know, tonight you're like, this is not helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, May 25th, they're they're shuttering that feature.  Google Fiber now has a business plan to gigabits for $250 a month.  One gigabit down now to $100 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Gigabit envy.  What do you have, Stacey?  What you got? What you got?  I only have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, one's plenty.  I should point out, John's reminded me he has Sonic Net and his gigabit fiber gigabit is $40.  You said 50 bucks when you add the fees and stuff.  That's pretty good.  Half foot. Google. Excellent.  It's charging.  If you are calling, let's see, is it calling from or to Ukraine?  Google Voice and Fi temporarily waive calling fees to Ukraine.  Let me see.  International calling fees from Ukraine and from the US to Ukraine are now all the fees.  The rates are now zero. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a race.  The fees from Ukraine to anywhere.  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google has said we have expanded of eligibility for Project Shield.  Our free protection against DDoS attacks so that Ukrainian government websites, embassies worldwide,  and other governments in close proximity to the conflict can stay online.  And of course, we saw it talked earlier about CloudFlare and CrowdStrike and Ping Services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. When I go to Kiev Independent, which I recommended last week, which is excellent,  or when I go to RT.com, CloudFlare comes up and says, I'm checking your browser for a few seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got DDoS. That's their DDoS protection.  Yeah.  You make sure you're legit.  Legit. Are you legit? He's too legit to quit.  Chrome OS 99 just came out. Faster desk creation, improved palm rejection, nearby share.  And one more thing on the buy-buy list. Google's pulling the plug on Assistant Snapshot,  which was, according to 9to5, Google the only trace left of Google Now.  So if you want to see what it did, you can ask your assistant for updates that you see in your snapshot,  like calendar events, birth year, stock prices. Why would they kill that? What do they save?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Now used to be my favorite, so I just don't get it. I just give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when Google Now came out, I was singing its praises saying, this is the future.  Me too. Me too.  This is where Google's going to put everybody in the dust.  Did we all use it or not?  Yeah.  I used it and would have used it more had they beefed it up even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they had to start tying it into more things. Yeah, it was such a disappointment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea was it was card-based and when you get to the airport, there's your tickets.  Here's the weather, the city you're going to. We'd kind of know what you're doing.  And I guess privacy advocates and just people scared about privacy just probably killed it that nobody wanted to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that actually makes sense. But I opted into everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did too. For it to be useful, you had to say, yeah, you can see everything.  You can look at my Gmail, whatever you want. And that's probably what killed it, I'm going to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they still do things like they still pull stuff from my email into my calendar for me and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  They're a new feature. I guess they're not now features now, I guess. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Snapshot was one of them, but that's going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's so terrible.  Oh, that's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I would check on my Samsung Galaxy S22 and see if I have a feature drop.  Maybe I get it here before I get on my Pixel. That'd be hysterical. Nope. Software's up to date. Security patch.  January. That sucks. That's why you buy a Pixel, right? Right there. Right there in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't make me have Pixel envy.  How's your flip?  My little Samsung Flip 3.  It's great.  You like it?  I love it. Come to me. Ta-da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like that wallpaper.  This is just the January one.  And you don't mind the manly wallet or you're not using the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am using the case. I always use the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good. I think for that phone especially, you kind of want to keep it a little. Isn't that cute? Look how cute it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't realize this until it was there and then I was like, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that nice? It's got a little screen on the back so that you can see what your notifications are, what the time is.  Actually, you can mess with that and get it to show even more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show more stuff.  Show more stuff.  I usually want my phone to show me less stuff in general because I'm easily distracted. But yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn off notifications, that's for sure. And that is the change.  Elon Musk says, I was forced. Forced, I tell you.  Into an agreement with the SEC. You should throw it out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we just all sigh and move on, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sigh. This is the one where he tweeted, funding secured to make Tesla private at $420 a share.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  I'll claim later determined to be untrue, but of course it sent the stock price sailing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a question. Do tech startup founders need to be jerks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's an argument for that, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there are a couple shows on TV now about this.  Right. Super pumped. I'm starting to watch that.  And he's a complete ass from day one. Travis Kalanick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though the taxi people are sometimes worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, it's true in that sense. I mean, the medallion owners and the taxi commission hated it.  But even from when he's pitching, at the very beginning he's pitching what was called Uber car at the time to a venture capitalist.  He lies and says he invented it. He didn't invent it.  You know, he kind of took it over.  So, yeah, I mean, I don't know how accurate it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, it's a little painful for me to watch because I don't watch any of those shows because I feel like I've lived through it.  I don't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The dropout is quite good because it's that's about Elizabeth Holmes and the Theranos story.  It starts when she's a little girl.  And so it gives you a little bit more perhaps depending on how accurate it is, a little more perspective into why she did.  I mean, that's the question. Why she did this. Did she knowingly defraud people? Was she swept up by events?  What exactly happened?  And I think they give you a pretty good explanation of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from a I also like it because it's from a podcast and, you know, so you're saying that on the whole and I have an exception to the second one.  On the whole, are you saying they do need to be jerks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but look, you look at Steve Jobs.  You look at Bill Gates, who was a real jerk. Ray Ford was a jerk. Who was? Ray Ford. Oh, my God, was he a jerk?  But maybe he wasn't a jerk for the Times. I don't know. What about Reid Hoffman? Was he a jerk? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By all accounts, he was a good man. We had Perry Chen talk to my class the other day and he was not a jerk.  And he also started what is in fact a small and successful company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of the question that they ask in the dropout. Did she have to lie to get funding? Is it fake it till you make it?  And is that I mean, obviously, it wasn't broke culture in her case, but but it was that same kind of drive to break the rules, move fast and break things, fake it till you make it.  I don't think that's necessarily the case. If you if I don't think you have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask a different question. If they weren't that fine, then if they weren't by chance so jerky, you're tracking more jerks.  Would the Internet be better? Would it have a better reputation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I think I think it doesn't. It actually probably helps if you're a jerk.  I really do think it helps. I don't think it's necessary, but I think it is helpful if you're a jerk to be a founder at a company  because it helps you stick to your vision and also probably gives you a little insulation from feeling from questioning the ethics or the ramifications of some of your decisions that I think are needed to succeed or to really burst out.  I don't know.  Be glad you don't live in South Korea. You put this in, didn't you?  I did. I did. This is South Korean election graphics are next level.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You got to start that one over again. It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the next level. I think it's the next level.  I think it's the next level. I think it's the next level.  I did. I did. This is South Korean election graphics are next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to start that one over again. It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a bear. I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A faceless bear that picks up the candidates like they're dolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This screen technology, you see in a lot of places, the idea is it's really just a flat screen, but you can make it feel like it's 3D because there's a bend in it.  And so it feels like the edge. It tricks your eye. And so it's kind of cool, but it's just a flat screen.  Here's more with the bear. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Skip down to any of them. They're all unbelievable.  There's a bear with a rocket going off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could do that. We could do this.  Oh, here's the candidates. What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're doing re-insign language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did they get them? Is sign language widespread in Korea?  Well, people are deaf in lots of places. Sure.  Oh, OK. Because all of these, by the way, have somebody signing in the corner, which is interesting.  Maybe they're just a little more sensitive to that. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then there's the next one down.  They're competing. Oh, this one. Yeah, that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. If you ever you probably don't watch the NFL, but there is a trend towards these quickie graphics now in the NFL.  They're incredibly corny and dumb because they're cheap.  You know, they're quickie. They're not not even as good as this, although this isn't the greatest.  So they're pointing this at playing this as an ice skate ice skating race.  It doesn't add anything to the information. No. Zero.  But it makes you watch.  You know, some it's cultural. Some some places, maybe they like the graphics.  They like more graphics. I love this screen.  We could do this. Should we start doing this?  Anthony, you could do that. Yeah, or whatever.  I could have Stacey and Jeff be in a curved box and they could feel like they're reaching out to grab me and punching you.  They are punching me. Oh, the doors are closing.  Oh, wow.  But what's funny is this is I mean, you see this all the time and lighthearted stuff, but that in an election today, I think.  Wow. I think this is an example of TV broadcasters even in South Korea really don't think much of their audience.  They think if we don't keep this very exciting, you see, then.  And by the way, by as a corollary, you could see how much we trust and love our audience and their intelligence because we have none of this.  We're in fact quite a dull show. We don't attempt in any way to keep your attention.  We just kind of slog along. We're very, very smart.  This is our show right here in that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then in other news, did you see this? This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The endurance has been found off the coast of Antarctica.  I love this. Three miles deep, almost perfectly preserved because it's so cold and so deep and there's so little oxygen at that depth.  This is the famous story of Shackleton who was trapped in the ice.  The glacier squeezed his boat. His men had to get off.  They hiked for days to get to civilization in very daunting odds.  He saved every one of them. Look at that. Look at that. Great leadership.  It's perfectly. It's like when you see the Titanic, you know.  Fortunately, treaties mean that they cannot touch or remove any items for the ship.  I almost wish it could be up though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's that one in the middle saying, I'm in charge now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this. Isn't that amazing? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was like an amateur historian who figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It was three miles from where they thought it would be.  Where was last or position was last accorded.  Where Shackleton thought his position was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, give him a break. It was probably pretty stressful.  Yeah. Is this where I parked my car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scooter X is telling the story in our chat room.  Endurance never reached land, became trapped in the dense ice pack.  And the 28 men on board eventually had no choice but to abandon ship  after months spent in makeshift camps on the ice floes drifting northwards.  The party took to the lifeboats to reach the inhospitable uninhabited elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scooter X is writing a novel in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elephant Island. Shackleton and five others then made an extraordinary  800 mile open boat journey in the lifeboat.  James cared to reach South Georgia. Shackleton and two others then crossed  the mountainous land to the whaling station of Stromness.  From there, Shackleton was able to eventually mount a rescue of the men  waiting on Elephant Island and bring them home without loss of life.  Pretty impressive. Pretty impressive.  Let us, unless there's a story that either of you are itching to talk about.  I think we've done all of your stories, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're hidden in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you sure? Because we haven't done anything related to TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there is a TikTok story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there is a video food story that's pretty amazing.

Transcript:  The remote village in Bangladesh.  Yeah.  So one story actually we didn't talk about, but I think is very interesting,  is Amazon is launching something called AMP.  Google might have something to say about it.  But it's not the same. Amazon AMP is a live audio app.  It's kind of like Clubhouse, but you can play music in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you're a DJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can take phone calls.  So it's basically talk radio or music radio in an app right now,  only available in pre-release.  You have to be invited to use it.  And I think they only have an iPhone app, but they will have others.  Pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would do it. I think it'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can spin.  You can be Leola Portman at the beginning of his career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is, I think, as important as YouTube was to video creators.  I mean, for instance, I could do my own talk radio show.  I could take phone calls.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh, we could have a heck of a good time.  Kevin and I doing some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play a song.  Did you talk up the songs when you were a DJ?  Oh, yeah, of course. You have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to. It's a terrible thing to do.  It ruins the song, but it makes you feel pretty damn good.  You can you got tens of millions of licensed songs from the big three music companies,  a long list of independent music companies.  CD Baby is in there as well.  No subscription, no additional hardware, no editing.  It's right through the iPhone.  Fascinating.  They're going to be shows from Nicki Minaj.  She's going to bring her radio show Queen Radio to amp.  Pusha T. Tinashe, Lindsay Sterling, the violinist, Travis Barker, Lil Yachty and Big Boy.  Well-known personalities, Teffy Pessoa and Nikita Dragoon, popular radio host, radio host, Zach Sang, Kate Corbett, Christian James Hand and Guy Ross, who took his How I Built This to Wondery to Amazon.  They own it.  So what to me, this is really bigger than maybe you might think.  This is Amazon saying just like Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we want to own the audio landscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Podcasting, I think it's been done.  I mean, you've done it now.  It's done.  This is the next thing.  Somebody's looking for the next thing.  This is Clubhouse and more.  I think it's so far beyond Clubhouse.  Oh, I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like everybody could be a radio station.  Yeah, but I, you know, they focus on music, but I don't think it's just music.  I mean, I really think you could do anything.  Yeah.  You also have can take callers with control over who speaks and when you can pre plan and schedule your shows, listen to songs in real time with your audience.  They plan according to Amazon to add even more from Alexa integrations to social sharing to innovative new search and discovery features.  Man, I wish I'd get I'd love to get an invite.  This seems like I really think this might be the future.  Yeah, you think what you and Kevin could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.  We already have a call in.  Do you have more more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So interesting play by Amazon for this on amp.com on amp.com and it is an iOS app.  I guess you you do your show in iOS.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android.  Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but this is pre released.  So it's right now it's stream your own radio show with the songs you love.  It's your mix and your mic.  I don't know.  Clubhouse is kind of no longer the flavor of the month.  So maybe this is the next big thing or maybe it's Korean election graphics.  Who knows?  Get ready.  Get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have got some good stuff for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ow.  Sorry.  Okay, that's not opening.  I've got a different good stuff for you.  This is a USB powered air quality monitor sensor from a company called Piera.  This is called the Canary.  It has a silly accent, but it's the Canary.  Here, I'll show you.  I'll show you the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's.  Canary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canary.  That's not an accent.  That's a long A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canary.  Canary.  Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canary.  A long A is A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canary.  Canary.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This sensor.  This is a little bit more professional from your home.  People use this in enterprise settings, but I was testing it because inside is a chip  that is performing actual most.  Let me back up.  Most air quality sensors check for estimates.  They basically shine a little laser light.  They're like, ah, this has about 20.  And then it's X part per billion.  They make their assessment on this.  This actually does some computer vision on the device to get the exact count.  Am I in the right place?  Is it this?  No, that's a security product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is why it's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's P-I-E-R-A systems.  What this company did is built a chip and then they were like, well, what the heck can  we do with this?  Because we're able to at low battery power do some machine learning that gives you exact  particulate measurements as opposed to estimates.  This is interesting because it's an exact measurement of particulates.  The purple is an estimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not doing the same thing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The purple is a good example of an estimate.  It's not exactly tracking your particular matter.  I mean, it's still very good enough for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have purples inside and outside from when we had the fires and it was really hard to  breathe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you could get one of these and test it for how much better it is or how much more  accurate it is.  And it also, I believe, pulls data more often than purple, which can be useful simply because  you want your data to be sampling as often as possible because when the air quality gets  bad, you want to be like, oh, I know now instead of breathing it for 30 minutes when it's not  breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, for the next fire.  So you don't plug it into a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are designed to be plugged into access points, Wi-Fi access points.  They've got to deal with Aruba and other places.  I plug mine into an outlet.  What are they called?  I just plug it into a USB port.  Thank you.  Yes.  Power supply.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy on IOTA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of those battery packs.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, just the power supply that then plugs into the wall.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  A USB hub.  No, just the power supply.  That's good.  And then does it use Bluetooth to talk to it?  What is it talking to?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It uses Bluetooth.  Okay.  Sorry.  I should have explained that.  Nice.  And it contains an ESP32, everybody's favorite alternative chip design.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not cheap, but I think the purple is comparable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this isn't really for people, but I think it's a really neat device and I think it's  a neat concept because I'm a sucker for people who are like, oh, I built some cool silicon  technology.  Let me not sell that because that's commodity and sell like, build a device.  Blink did that and then was bought by Amazon, for example.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Neat.  From Pierrasystems.com.  P-I-E-R-A.  The Canary A1 for Aruba.  Oh, wait a minute.  I got the one for Aruba Access Points.  I was wondering why they kept saying Aruba Access Points.  There's also, that was $200.  That's $250.  That's the one you have, I think.  Connect to the cloud using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and a monitor here from everywhere.  Cool.  Do they have a...  So one of the things I like about purple is you could be part of a larger map of air quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do not do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, because part of this, they want to design...  This is for like companies who are...  Like if you're a small business owner and you're like, let's check out our indoor air  quality, this is a solution for you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Jeff Jarvis, your number or pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do a really quick one.  Yeah.  So Matt Carolean is one of my favorite people on Twitter.  Really, really smart guy.  He's the general manager of Boston.com, which is the Boston Globe.  Platforms there.  He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard.  He teaches journalism at the Harvard Extension.  We were having a discussion on Twitter as we do about wonky media things this week.  The Wall Street Journal did a supposed expose about ads misplaced in the Gannett Network.  And they said there were billions of ads.  And I said, this is ridiculous.  And Matt and I were going back and forth.  And then Matt came in, Leo, this is going to hit you with a solar plexus like it did  me.  And he said, unrelated.  I find it so bizarre that you reply to my tweets.  When I was in high school and college, I would listen to you on This Week in Tech with Leo  Laporte.  You guys were just effectively fictional characters to me at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we still are.  We've been around that long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You ought to see Anastasia W. Higginbotham.  He was in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like that makes us so old.  But the worst thing is, and it happened just the other day on Reddit where people say,  is he still alive?  Is he still around?  I remember him from when I was in high school.  Whatever happened, or worse almost, whatever happened to him?  Ouch.  I know.  I know.  That's all right.  That's the price of fame and fortune.  What can I say?  So is that a number?  That's just an anecdote.  That's just old.  We're just old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could have done another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's forgotten the number because he's old.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Man from the Future, Visionary Life of John von Neumann.  I think you guys will like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to get that book.  Thank you for recommending that.  That's great.  That is a good rec.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I listen to it.  Added to my wish list.  Very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which plan do you use on Audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been trying to get me off it forever because I signed up in 2000 when they had  a, I think it was, they called it the light listener plan.  It was two books a month and it was fairly inexpensive.  I even got email from the founder and stuff saying, you know, when you sign up, that was,  you know, like, you want me to pay more?  No.  I have my deal.  I have my deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I, when I wanted to do my language lessons on it, I needed a lot of tokens, whatever  they call it.  And so I signed up for the annual one, 24.  Yes.  So it's about to come due and I'm going to suddenly get a whoop.  How much is, how much of that curiosity?  I forget.  I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was like, yeah, it was 10 bucks a month for two monthly credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's, that's, it's about 10 bucks.  So when I buy the three extra credits, which I do frequently, very frequently, it's, I  think an extra 10 bucks for the extra three credits.  So those 10 bucks per credit, I mean, nine something per credit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I still love you audible.  That's all I can say.  And they are also, we should mention a sponsor, which I probably should always say when we  talk about them.  Thank you.  I'm not going to do a pick because I'm too lazy.  Lazy.  You're just lazy and old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's five o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's five o'clock.  I already ordered my sushi.  The sushi takes forever.  I already ordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sun has gone over the yard arm.  I thank you so much, Stacey, or as we know her, Anastasia W Higginbotham.  Stacey on iot.com.  She does the podcast with Kevin Toffle and has a great newsletter too.  That's free to all.  So is the site.  Please.  This poor woman is starving.  Just join, join, join, do something.  Stacey on iot.com.  Do you have a premium membership?  No, you don't even, you don't charge.  I don't charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I charge my advertisers.  So if you feel like really special, you can click on my advertisers.  They are a good group of people.  So that's about it.  That's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is of course the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Ray Kroc called him a nickel millionaire, but he's our nickel millionaire.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least, at least it's at least 10 cents by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John sees what I'm looking at right now.  I didn't realize it's already time to spring forward.  So that means you just lost two hours of your life listening to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're about to lose another hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another one's going away.  You know, March 13th, we spring forward.  So if you want to watch this show right now, it's 11.  It's a it's on the air at 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.  And it used to be 2200, but we're going to spring forward, which means relative to UTC, we're going to spring backwards or it's going to go backwards.  We're going to go forward.  So it's 2100.  You know, I love you.  It's very relativistic.  It took me a long time to understand that if we set our clocks forward, that in effect, we are starting an hour earlier.  In the rest of the world.  I think that even as I say it doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it hurts my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you are, however, as in the UK, because, you know, ever since I think it was Obama where we decided, no, we want to do it earlier and later.  And so the rest of the world, it's not for a couple of weeks.  That even makes it worse.  It really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, it's even worse talking about it for five minutes.  Let's go.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, everybody.  Come back here next week at some time or other and we'll be here for you.  Have a wonderful week.  And that's it for this week in Google.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Take a deep dive into the stories that define the new space age.  What's NASA up to?  When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?  How about those samples in the Perseverance Rover?  When are those coming home?  What the heck is Elon Musk done now?  In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look at bits of spaceflight history that you probably never heard of and all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
