Transcript:  I am joining you from my hotel room at an airport hotel in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  generic so generic SF fridge, that's very nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice. Where's the Amazon echo in there? I can't see where it's where it's mounted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this one doesn't have one I'm sure there's a security camera hidden somewhere in here though, oh let's not think about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hoping not but also joining us super awesome guy Matt cuts acting administrator for the US digital service  And it's been a while since you've been on this week in Google's great to have you back Matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really good to be back. Thanks for having me. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I  I'm gonna ask you because like leading up to the show  I was like man  What is Matt doing right now because your your kind of duties at the US digital service have shifted over the past  I don't know year. Did you start about a year ago at this point? And I mean, I know at the beginning of the year things really  Changed what are you doing right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a yeah, it's a year and three months at this point  So whenever I started out I joined the team of the US digital service that was working at the Pentagon and they're doing some  Really cool stuff about military recruiting and and trying to you know  Make those systems work better and then in January I switched to the headquarters  Which is part of the executive office of the president and have been the administrator and there's so many great projects happening  Like if we get the right engineers product managers designers on board  We've got some really really fantastic stuff to help veterans doctors and patients  Just a ton of different people with different, you know making the federal government work better  Which is as important a problem as we can do nice. That's really cool stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Important work and I I have to imagine we were talking a little bit about this prior to the show  But you know shifting from the Bay Area where you've worked for so long to go to the other coast essentially go to go to Washington DC  And live your life there as DC is such an awesome city  So I'm sure you're having a lot of fun being in a new place and basically you have a new life at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot to do there. So it turns out our cats are city cats who knew  Just it's all the sirens immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they just stay indoors anyways, and occasionally hopefully at least I'm hoping they crawl onto your shoulders during the show  Maybe maybe I'm holding out hope for something that won't happen. But hey, it makes really great TV. So we'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a thing. I'm so in I want to see this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know we've had we've had some intrusions by your pets as well Stacy and I gotta say it really makes great TV when  That happens. Yeah, you know, it's honestly cute. Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No naked mole rats. I don't want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not gonna tell you what I what I had planned for a little bit later  alright, so before we kind of get started with you know, some of the  Really really important news  You may remember go back in time just a week ago  We celebrated Google's 20 year anniversary of registering the domain google.com  This week we celebrate Google's 19th birthday and who knows what we'll celebrate next week  But Google  Yeah, I think that's probably it new pixel devices will be you guys will be celebrating that I won't be on that show  But I'll be there in spirit  But Google is celebrating if you go to google.com  They you know, they're Google doodle that change it all the time has a little play button on it. It activates a spinner  So you can you can spin?  Spin for your chance to play one of 19 different  Doodle games from kind of I think from Google's history essentially, right?  Yeah, kind of dives back in time. Oh, I got that one too Carson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I remember so so who does like who gets the fun job of like making these games and doing this and do they?  have another job or is this all they get to do because I  Every time I see these as they become more as they become fancier. I'm like  What's doing that? How fun is their job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a dedicated doodle team at Google that works on you know  Trying to figure out what would be good doodles and then sometimes they get assists from other parts of the company whenever you've got  An engineer who's like I can code up a version of Pac-Man for you that fits in a logo that sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's it. I'm like that's kind of heartens me that there that's an opportunity for people to have fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know right if that is your task for the day is to create these things you've got a pretty awesome job  So that you've got Pac-Man you got tic-tac-toe Earth Day quizzes this new snake game if snakes your jam  You can go there. You can play snake all sorts of different things. So spin the wheel see if you can play all 19  I don't know, you know  What happened when they did the Pac-Man game that some company like figured out just how much productivity?  Was spent wasted on playing Pac-Man and how much that actually cost the economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, can I tell you my favorite Google logo secret, which you can't tell my dad about?  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is your dad watch this week in Google? I guess that's the important I'm hoping he doesn't watch this episode. Otherwise, I break his heart. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a wonderful engineer on our team who we decided to do a just a fun goodwill thing and  What it was is when we knew it was a person's birthday because they have their birthday set in their profile  It will show a special special birthday logo  Which I think is a fantastic idea  Unfortunately, my dad thinks that like it's only for him  He doesn't realize that the logo appears for everybody and it kind of is you know for him because like a person on the webspam team  Coded that that original incarnation up but  He thinks oh you still have some sway with Google cuz my birthday and and you showed the logo and I'm and I'm like, yeah  Dad, that's for you  Totally for you. You're special

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever it takes to keep dad happy  No one no one tell mr. Cutts this that would that would break his heart like oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. He's not on Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He does look for Google news stories of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does look for Google news stories of me, so please don't write any stories about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I should never have asked this question. That was the wrong thing to do Jason. That was my my choice  All right, well keep us posted on that. I'm sure he'll never find out  Because really that's that's what Google wants, right?  It wants everybody to feel very special and continue using their products and continue sharing  Everything that you possibly can with them  For all that game, why don't we talk a little bit about this last week we were kind of  Hypothesizing about the rumors of HTC and Google we had heard at that point that rumors were saying that Google might actually buy  HTC's mobile phone division outright  Turned out, you know, I think it was the very next day. We found out what actually happened HTC struck a deal with Google  That resulted in Google paying HTC  $1.1 billion and  for that sum  Google gets 2000 around 2000 HTC employees for its own hardware division  Not only that Google gets non-exclusive access to HTC's IP library for their devices  So not an all-out buyout, which you know, really I feel like at the end of last week's episode  I walked away going that makes a lot of sense. They're totally doing that. No, they're not  It's a stripped-down deal as far as that's concerned but still gives Google, you know  Pretty pretty hearty boost when it comes to their their hardware ambitions, you know, it's possible that they might work on their own  Soc  Possibly integrating further tensor processing units the TPUs into the devices. We know that that's their plan  So 2,000 employees is nothing to sneeze at. What do you guys what do you think about this? Did this live up to the hype?  I guess we'll find out but  What do you think Matt so or Stacy actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'll just say at least it's much much cheaper than Motorola and then with that off to you Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, oh I am having crazy connectivity stuff, sorry you guys here, um, let me let me see if I can adjust something  That's we can hear you it's a little ramped down you can still hear you. Yeah. Okay  Okay  Fabulous. Okay. So I was I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thought it was hey, it's cheaper than Motorola and it's cheaper than nest and it gets them a lot of credibility in this space  And I'm super excited  Because I want Google to have hardware  That's awesome and user-friendly so they can actually start delivering on this promise of truly contextual information  From their kind of AI back end  So I was really excited about this and I'm kind of sad that the next phone I buy will probably have a lot of this  In there that was my take

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious to know  Like obviously with the next pixel devices coming out  We know that HTC is involved with one of them LG is involved with the other the smaller of the two pixel devices the pixel  XL to or no, sorry the pixel two and then there's the pixel to XL which is the one that LG is involved with  I'm curious to know which one of these two like being that they're produced by different manufacturers  How similar they actually end up being which makes me think they're probably there's probably going to be some very subtle if not  So subtle, you know differences between how these devices end up  but of those two devices does the one produced by HTC end up being the better of the two and  You know, how does that shape the perspective of this purchase in?  In you know merely a week later after her week or two later after it was announced the deal was announced I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will say I have the so this was the Nexus so from two years ago that was produced by LG and that was the one with  The huge flaw that makes it just stop working at a certain point in time  So after two of them that have stopped working, I'm like, hey, you know what, you know, it would be good for  Google for me a phone not made by LG. So that's like HTC  It has good  I've always liked its UI. I would love to see something. I mean, do you remember HTC sense? That was just great  I would love to see that in  In a pixel look some of that influence there as part of either the phone or even Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I remember HTC sense back in the day  You know as far as the overlays were concerned  I was actually pretty into HTC sense, especially when compared to what what touch whiz was  But then over the years, you know  I at least for me and I think a lot of enthusiasts have grown more and more accustomed to kind of like the stripped down  Not quite so heavily influenced on the UI side of things  You know version of Android not not quite so much with the overlay  And even HTC on their own phones has kind of stripped things back a little bit and refined it to a better position. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I will give one power tip  Which is if you do have a Nexus 5x still sitting around the house and I've got one and I've been a little  Scared to upgrade it because I'm worried, you know  that  Upgraded it might cause it to crash or a brick itself  But if at least right now if you go to the Google Store  They have pixels for sale and you can trade in your phone and Nexus 5x is one of those that you can trade in  I don't know if it'll stick around for whenever the new pixel 2 stuff comes out  But I'm like, okay  I can hold on to this Nexus 5x a little while longer and then use it as trade-in fodder so that I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get a little bit of a discount. Yeah, mine's totally broken. So I cannot do that. What happened to your five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, how did it break? Did you drop it? Or is it like no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the LG flaw. It's it just suddenly killed us. It's the second time this happened the first time Google actually  Replaced it but then it happened again. It's okay. I'm like a week away from having hopefully a new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean it's worth worth checking out  You know considering it's kind of tied to some sort of a flaw with the hardware  I think the trade-in value on the 5x if I remember I'm trying to find it right now and having a hard time  But I think the trade-in value was somewhere right around like 80 to 100 bucks  So, I mean, you know Google might work with you and knock that off considering it's a  Flaw of the actual hardware 5x has been known to have its its bugs and its issues  No, actually the site is saying Nexus 5x up to $165 in trade-in value  Nothing is that because these foot pixel of devices are gonna be expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get what you can buy and buy the Nexus 5x on eBay for $5

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arbitrage yes, exactly arbitrage. How can we maximize our savings?  So much work to get $100 off, but hey if that's your if that's your intention there are ways. I'm sure  And by the way since we're since we're kind of talking about next week's  Event if you didn't know we're definitely gonna be doing coverage here on on the stream will be doing live coverage  I actually won't be here but Ron Richards  I believe with Leo Laporte are gonna be on set Wednesday October 4th starting at 9 a.m  Pacific 12 p.m  Eastern before this show next week  So you guys are gonna have all the stuff to talk about sure plenty to keep you fueled throughout the episode and to get excited  about are either of you like interested in the the pixel book the kind of  Rumored next generation of the Chromebook pixel that I have here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff will be yeah  I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm good. Yeah, I've got my Chromebook right here. My dad's got a Chromebook  I've got a Chromebook at work just for getting on the guest Wi-Fi there  So October 4th is like my Christmas because that's basically what I'll be getting for Christmas  I'll just take one of everything, you know, we'll see about all the various accessories, but yeah the the pixel book  It's been a couple years. I was worried whether we would have a new a new one or not  And you know, I hope it's got a real keyboard not you know some  magnetic attachment latch do hickey because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes you want a real keyboard. Yes. No, I completely agree  I've been holding out because this is the first generation and we talked about this a little bit last week  But I mean it's pricey. It's a it's a pricey up, you know next generation  You okay with that? Do you find the the pixel line to be worth worth the upgraded cost compared to others?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whenever you make a user story for pixel books and Chromebooks  Like there's probably a picture of me right there like, you know  Two-factor authentication and security keys and all that sort of stuff. It's right down my alley  So needless to say you're all in you're all yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also  Just a little bit more information about the new pixel devices themselves. We have now multiple sources to different  publications including Android police and also to  VGR and a few others that are saying just a few tidbits  Basically, both of the devices are gonna have stereo front-facing speakers that I'm guessing is to you know, at least in some ways  Will make up for the fact that there is no headphone jack. You're gonna need a dongle in order to do that  But you get stereo front-facing speaker. So yeah  Also software-based portrait mode. So doing the kind of fate, you know dynamic fading of the background or a  blurring of the background  Keeping the foreground in in focus kind of similar to DSLR techniques that you can do  But this wouldn't be done with a dual camera  I have the node 8 right here and you can do that sort of thing  But you know it requires the dual camera array on the back in order to do that and the iPhone 8  Plus does this with dual cameras a lot of them do it with dual cameras  apparently this is gonna have these pixel devices are gonna have single camera and  Still be able to do this through software  We'll see how well that's done. I don't know  I'm a little hesitant on that one because I feel like that's a lot computationally  That's a lot to pull off and make it look actually really good  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If anyone could do it Google I I trust I mean photos is such an amazing product and I am constantly surprised like even their scanning  technology is  That's all software and it's like magic. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. It's a good point photos is by by and large one of my favorite all-time kind of Google apps and services  and that's because they do such amazing things with their computational stuff on the back end and  Yeah, so I guess from that perspective  Who's to say that they can't pull it off and make it look good also music recognition from the lock screen  So think Shazam style recognition, but that's happening live on your lock screen  So if you happen to be somewhere and you're like, hey, I like this song  You just look at your lock screen and then you realize it's Justin Bieber and then you burn your phone  So that's either a feature or a bug depending on how you look at it  I'm  always on display squeezable frame that we kind of knew about and  Yeah, I'm sure a whole lot more  I'm hoping a whole lot more at this point  We know so many things or we think we know so many things through the leaks that there's just no surprise left in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anymore that's it's like looking at your Christmas presents before Christmas morning. I mean, it really is terrible  It really I used to do that. So I know this feeling of disappointment really well. I'm like, oh this is so familiar  In all honesty, I mean, what would you  What would you like to see I sit there and I think about my phone and I'm like, you know  It does pretty much everything I wanted to do and the things I wanted to do like float in the air after me  So when I'm not wearing pockets, I still have access to it, you know, that's that's probably not gonna be in this issue. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. I mean I have I have a hard time sometimes like analyzing how  Like I have how I feel about these announcements because I do what I do and then I have a hard time  Analyzing how I would feel if I don't if I wasn't in the position that I am where I review a lot of phones  I talk about technology all the time  Like how would I actually feel I you know?  What would I feel like I really need out of another phone if I had last year's pixel and this next pixel is coming out  What would it take to kind of move the needle and make me feel like I need to buy this and I think if I was  Just using it like, you know, just a regular everyday user. I'd be pretty I'd still be very satisfied with my current pixel  It's a pretty great device

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a good device  But I would so give up an extra millimeter or two in order to have more battery life  It feels like always so many people are like look the bezels are so thin and all that sort of stuff  I'm like  I just want a phone that will always make it through the day and into karaoke that night because turns out you can do  Karaoke in DC but all I'm saying is like, you know  You want to be able to make sure that phone can make it through the concert or whatever?  It's that you're going to and after a year the battery life always tends to go down a little bit  So whether it's more battery or you know the ability to swap out a battery that that would be pretty nice  I take that over being waterproof. How often you go swimming with your phone? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drop my phone in bodies not bodies of water. Well, sometimes bodies of water  It's a hard thing to learn not to put your phone into your front pocket, you know, that's I  Would have thought I would have learned it by now, but no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem with that is you have learned it for like 95% of the time  But it's that one time that you lapse that is the time that it that it goes for a dunk goes for a swim  Definitely been there. Yeah, I'm happy to hear that these are probably going to be  Water and dust  Protected I have a better IP rating in that regard. But yeah, I don't know  I've been pretty satisfied with my pixel  But of course I will you know be eager to see what they have and probably get it because hey we talked about this stuff  All the time in the network. It's kind of what we do here  Hey, what did you think about?  the jacquard news  Project jacquard, which is Google's I guess it was two  I can't remember if it was two or three years ago at Google IO Google showed off with its a tap division  Which is kind of its experimental technology division  Project jacquard, which is essentially fabric that has conductive  Electronics in interwoven into the fabric so you can do things like make the sleeve which is the case with the Levi jacket here  Make the sleeve touch sensitive so it can connect to and sync with your phone so that in this case while you're riding your  Bicycle around New York City instead of having to like look at your phone to switch songs  You just brush your sleeve and it switches to the next track  Well now we're finally seeing the fruits of all of that effort with a $350 jacket called Levi's commuter trucker jacket  The non-tech version cost $148 this is the one that has project jacquard interwoven into the sleeves and  I gotta ask you guys $350 worth it. Is this a jacket that you would buy? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who you know what I would buy and in here's I  Would buy actually jacquard probably not interwoven into my couch because my couch is gonna last for you know  Hopefully like ten years maybe longer and I'm a little doubtful of the technology  But like a little flap that I could stick on my couch like a little couch doily that has this capability  That might be kind of fun  But in a jacket that kind of cost for  No, no, I'm much more excited about actually Apple's air pod plus its watch for something like that where I can just ask  Siri to do something for me or you know get Google so I can just talk to it while I'm biking that that feels much more  Reasonable. I like the idea of a Google doily

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A Google doily go on that go on the record with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also the case that like for $350 you're locked into one look and maybe you really enjoy Springsteen  Or maybe that really fits with you know your personal fashion statement  But if I had a Google doily then I could you know or a Google, you know  Just a piece of fabric you could wear like when you're running a headband or something  Then you could you know, you could have it be modular  Right card sweat bands. Oh my gosh, you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, I'm thinking headband  I was thinking headband wonder twin power activate  Yeah, that would work too. Actually, man. There's a whole lineup here  I do do we think that the potential of Jacquard will take it that far?  I mean, this is this is the first product it took a long time now mind you they say they waited until this fall  They probably could have it released it sooner, but the the fashion industry works on a different timetable, right?  This is a jacket that's perfect for the fall  Seasons that they kind of had to wait until now to release it and it definitely has a very specific target audience  You know of a bicyclist essentially  But I mean do we see Jacquard?  Going in in large numbers to other  Types of wearables or is this one of those projects one of those Google projects that it's neat that they did it  It's neat that they tried it but probably not gonna see much more of it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I don't know if you saw the story I think it was on the rundown about it you can't wash it more than ten times  Yes, so that feels like maybe actual clothing isn't the right venue  Although you know, I don't know if I've washed my jackets ten times. Yeah, that's my question. Yeah  So fair, but if there's a durability question about it, it's very expensive to pay for  What is what 35 bucks between between washing?  so  Again clothes may not be the right form factor  I don't think doilies probably are either but trying to figure out some sort of transitional a place to put  Fabric connectivity and fabric is actually a really cool idea. And I I think it'd be interesting in like cars  Like the upholstery and cars maybe  Armrests and furniture again, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like I mean as far as like embedding it into things that aren't clothes  It would have to be embedded into something like the car actually makes a whole lot of sense because you're only ever  Really sitting in that driver's seat like there's always someone sitting in the driver's seat. So having a panel, you know that that is  Responsive in that way like it's always gonna get used because there's no other way to do it like a couch or a sofa  Sofa actually prime example if you had connectivity built into the armrest of a sofa that only works if you're sitting on that side of the sofa  If you're on the other side, it's way more inconvenient for you to have to get up and go over there and do the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, who says you can't build it on both arms. I suppose so we're weaving technology into fabric here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think that well and there's a there's a $50 kit called makey makey that lets you hook up  You know two alligator clips to almost anything like bananas and then you can use that as a sensor input  So I feel like if you could make the fabric be, you know compatible with a system like that, you know  So it's like a little label like Scotchgard except it's you know  Controllable fabric or something like that. Then yeah, you got it on both sides of the couch  You could have it in the upholstery on the car  It just doesn't feel like you got to lock it into one platform of a particular item of clothing so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah for me it feels very neat that you're able to do this  I just don't know how essential it is  but maybe I'm not maybe I'm not the right person to think about like  You know the future of technology in that regard, right?  Like when I think about it embedded into a couch like what do I need that for?  I just use I either use my voice or you know  a voice is actually very convenient now that I have my Google home in the living room if I really need to turn off the  Lights or turn on the TV. I can do it with my voice. Do I choose to know because I always have that remote  There that does everything that I needed to do and that just is fine  But maybe that's just me looking through now lens not later lens. Yeah, that's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for the people who lose their remotes all the time  Perfect. It's now your couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your couch is now your remote. Yes, the biggest remote you have in your home is your couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's hope you don't replace your couch very often and also, you know washing your couch  how many washes until  it stops or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many times you're gonna have to update the firmware on your couch or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my couch has malware so actually what this means though is that in the future  We will have to plug our couches into the wall socket. Yes. This is the thing we are not used to yet  Get a couch we need a wall socket to plug it into otherwise that technology is not gonna work needs to be powered somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and it wouldn't be energy harvesting like there's no kinetic energy on your couch. No, you're just sitting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then the next generation, you know, they'll have all these features built into the couch  And so you'll have your kids telling you well have you rebooted your couch?  Control alt delete on your couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a pain. It's a pain and I don't like the future at all  The future sounds inconvenient

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're back to doilies. That's really what it boils down to grandma's grandma's Google doily. All right, I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a good direction  Real quick here one thing that we didn't touch on that. I doubt this is gonna appear next next week, but this is new  new information that we have about  Google's plans to work with Google Home and kind of spruce it up with a larger premium model  Apparently they're working on a version that has stereo speakers. I don't know how you do that in that small form factor  Maybe it's not a small form factor. Maybe it's like a boombox. That would actually be kind of cool  The Google Home Max is apparently the internal name for that's tentative at this place at this point  It would be to challenge the Sonos play 3 system would be using premium materials premium build quality and  Yeah, I mean I guess this makes sense and we'll talk about Amazon's  Big stream of announcements that kind of ties into what Google is probably doing as well  It seems like they're both kind of building out their portfolio around around this type of hardware  But do you think a stereo Google Home is necessary?  Maybe it's maybe it's not as much stereo as it is high-fi version of Google Home  Either of you want that to use it in that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a skeptic  I'm like I've had this argument with friends who have Sonos and they've spent like  thousands of dollars on their Sonos and they're like I can walk from room to room and the audio is seamless and I'm like  You know what else walks from room to room with you is your phone and it's really not that hard to like play some audio  On your phone  Maybe it'll have stereo speakers on the front and then you can get good audio that way and it's just you know  It's always with you it's always easy to have your music with you as opposed to weird Bluetooth connectivity and all that sort of stuff  So so I don't know I tend to be a fan of like I'll just have one device and carry it with me rather than like  Blanketing my home and speakers, but that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you listen to actual real music on your phone and you just walk around with it and you put the phone down and you  Listen to the music coming from it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm also a barbarian like I you know eat out of the can and  No, no, don't listen to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm like, I'm just I'm just making sure I understood this I'm like so you just okay. So wait this happens. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zero configuration you have one device it just goes and that's why I'm so incredibly annoyed that they're like  Oh, by the way, you don't need a headphone jack on your phone  I'm like that is literally the only jack I need on my phone is the headphone jack like oh, it's got to be thinner  I'm like, no, it doesn't need to be thinner. It needs more battery life. Sorry. Okay. I'm into rant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, so you listen on a headset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do both. I do both

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Okay, so that is that is I'm gonna say it right here. You're kind of weird. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Experience I mean I I would personally opt for yeah better speakers  Allowing it to play it in rooms, but I also see the other side of this at least with my kids  We have a Nexus 5x that I have repurposed  I've set it up with family links so we all it can do the only thing it can do is  It can run Google music on it  And that's because my kids if they get a hold of a screen they will never leave it  But I want them to have the ability to always play music anytime  And so it's like well, how do I get rid of all the other screen things?  But still let them do what is today's you know equivalent to a boombox  You know have all your music in the cloud streaming on a service so I give them that and  And that tends to work, but they know how to connect it to the speakers throughout the house  They know how to do this yet  They always choose to just play it from the phone and the phone goes with them everywhere, and that's just good enough  So I see both sides of this I would not choose to do that, but it's certainly convenient  MP3s my right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  MP3s are like six kilobits. It's fine, you know  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand I'm super stoked. I'm not Matt. I you kind of lost credibility on the audio question. I feel  Like oh, okay  So there's there's a couple things here one is this feels like okay. Yes competing with home pod  But also on October 4th, so knows is going to make a big product announcement as well  presumably new  Hardware new speakers, but also the ability to work with Amazon echo so keeping that in mind, too  And then yes, we just got all the echo stuff that we'll talk about later. Yeah  This feels like it's necessary. I mean the Google home isn't  It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's not the only speaker I would ever need so  Yeah, I I guess I'd buy it. I don't really use my home very much though, so I'm kind of I  Don't know I use I use the echo far more than I use the home

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do not have an echo so I don't know the point of comparison  But I do know that probably 80% of what I use our Google homes for is playing music  You know because it's just you know, it's easy to just fire it off before I got the Google home  I've been telling myself for years because I'm a big music fan, but I had fallen out of the habit of listening to music  I just got really used to you know, we do podcasts  So I started listening to podcasts and I started having podcast guilt because all the music that I spent my childhood and you know  Younger years listening to like I just stopped listening to it  Then we got a Google home and now I listen to music all the time  So it's it's become one of the main reasons so I would totally get one of these if it makes it sound better sure  Although the current one is totally fine, too  It's maybe it's not the best sound in the world, but it's good enough for what I need. It's better than playing it through my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna call it now. This is the new minimalism trend where people are like  I just spent four hours of my weekend configuring my Sonos or whatever, but the Bluetooth still doesn't work  I can't get this app to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, stop stop right there. That's the beauty of Sonos. It takes like ten minutes. I have six Sonos is I am one of those people  who spent lots of money and  You know what I would love though  What if like on Sonos Google and Sonos teamed up and they were like by the way  Just tell Google assistant to play, you know Beyonce on your Sonos living room Sonos and that happened because that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Freaking amazing. Is there no integration between Google home and Sonos right now? I don't know cuz there's no integration between Sonos and anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm kind of done with like, you know, this company has this territorial, you know choice towards this other company and so  Just do it on your phone man. It's always works on your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just works just work I I never I never have my phone this is this is a girl problem, but it's it's a real one  It's a legit problem. I don't have pockets and everything. So the phone  Sometimes it's not next to me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, that's fair. Sometimes I do that on purpose  I  Fridge and leave because you know what that way I could live my life without being notified to death  But that's just me, you know, it's right back to the the minimalism thing that you're talking about Matt  Sometimes you just need to step away and simplify a little bit  Let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this episode  And then we'll get back to talking more about Google and also Amazon's big announcements  We keep mentioning that so we should probably get to that at some point  But first let's take a minute to thank Casper the sponsor of this episode Casper is an online retailer of premium  Mattresses for a fraction of the cost we have two Casper's in our house and a third mattress  That is not a Casper and it is on our list to replace that with a Casper  That's how good it is because anytime we end up having to lay down on that other mattress for just like man  This is uncomfortable. It's just not the same  Casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost of  Dealing with resellers and showrooms and then passing the savings directly to the consumer you  Casper's mattress is an obsessively  engineered mattress at a fair price  Casper's made of supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with just the right sink just the right bounce  It's exactly what you want  Plus its breathable design sleeps cool to help you regulate your temperature throughout the night and I can attest to that part especially  It does really well in that regard a Casper mattress provides long-lasting comfort and  Support and you can buy it easily online like you're used to buying so many other things completely risk-free  We've you know, we've had our Casper mattress now for like I think a couple of years  We've had it in our master and we also got one in our in our girls bedroom one of our girls bedroom  We all love it super soft. It's comfortable Casper really understands and this is pretty important how important it is  For truly testing truly trying out that mattress in a reality sort of setting like in your home  You're gonna spend a third of your life on a mattress  So it better be comfortable so Casper offers free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period  So you don't have to lie down in a showroom and make that split decision  Which is what we did on the first mattress that we now hate  And did you know statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation to whether it is the right bed for you  It's really hard to make that determination. You'll really get that by sleeping on it  You know day in day out and then you really understand why it's so great Casper recently introduced the Casper wave mattress  Which features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer?  Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards and are made in the USA  Free shipping and returns to the US and Canada and now the UK as well  Get a Casper mattress today, you can save an additional $50 towards a mattress purchase by going to casper.com  slash twig promo code twig that's  Twig is the promo code there. That's casper.com slash twig with the promo code twig and you'll save an additional  $50 off mattress purchase terms and conditions do apply there  But check it out go to casper.com slash twig and use the promo code twig  At checkout and you'll get that discount we thank Casper for their support of this week in Google  All right, I'm sure we've got hey well, let's let's just jump over to Amazon we keep talking about it this way  We don't have to dance around it anymore. I feel like I feel like this was a very surprise  Announcement on Amazon's part. I had no idea that there was an event. Maybe I was just out of the loop  but then suddenly boom boom boom it was like five million products were being announced and  We've got them all here. Well, we don't have them in studio, but we've got them to talk about  Amazon showed off first a new smaller echo device  It's wrapped in cloth. It's not quite half the size  But it's it's probably like I don't know it probably cuts off a third of a third of the size of the original echo  It's wrapped in cloth. So maybe it fits into your home a little bit better  $99 you can get a three-pack if you like buying in packs for  $250 you just add three to the cart and then you get a 50 $50 discount applied there and  Apparently this well with a three-pack obviously it offers the echoes new multi-room functionality  So you can get these between rooms like we were just talking about  Matt will not do that  many others will  And then you can also make free calls in the US Canada and Mexico as well as 911 calls  I'm assuming this because you can plug the phone into this which that's what you can do with another device the announcement  We'll talk about in a second, but smaller echo  $99 so lowering the the entry point for kind of what used to be premium echo  functionality  Which thanks Stacey. I know that you are an echo user. What do you think about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, I'm super excited now  So I looked at this and I was I was kind of bummed that I do not have like the wood greened  The faux wood grained echo like oh, that's kind of neat. I  Have to see in my house. I've got two dots and two  Two normal sized echoes and so I really I'm running out of rooms. I could buy one more and put it in  Okay. Yeah, I've got one more room. I could use it in so  It I probably would buy it, but I may actually go for there's two other products that I'm really excited about so  Okay, the plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about the class. All right. All right. Well, the plus is it's kind of hard to call  I mean, well, okay  So the plus is the more premium of the devices that they showed off today  Although it's still cheaper than the current echo or they like the original echo  It's a hundred forty nine dollars, which is thirty dollars cheaper than the original echo  But the echo plus retains the big bigger form factor of the original  They've kind of redesigned a little bit of the material and everything to make it look a little sleeker and everything a little bit more refined  It it has a built-in smart home hub for smart home control  It also includes higher-end sound and components for those who play their music through an echo and not on their phone  It ships with sorry bad. I can't help it. It's all good. It's all good  Ships with proud. Yes, wear it like a badge of honor  It ships with a hue light bulb in the box  Which I think is there to kind of prove that this is meant to control to be a hub for your smart home  Stacey, do you know what what is the standard that's built into here?  Because I mean I have hue at home and it requires a light bulb hub the hue uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zigbee, but it uses it uses I think Zigbee ha so Zigbee is kind of a pain because there were many variations on this standard  Software profiles so things could get kind of wacky between things but the fact that there is no hub  They're basically saying that hey the hue guys are like, yeah  This thing talks Zigbee and we're gonna just talk to it and you don't need a hub as someone who has I kid you not  Ten different hubs. I can see if I bought one of these I could get rid of like six of them  Which totally worthwhile because my little server closet is it's the hub home  And I would I would love this and you know  Everybody who who listens to my show would be excited to because I give away my hubs when I'm done with them  So they'd be like, yeah, I get a wink hub. I got a smart things you get a Phillips hue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically this hub is going to replace multiple other hubs  That's that's the thought yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That that would be my hope I would lose the software functionality. So like  And this is this is something to think about like if I had this and I had the Phillips hue bulb  Would I use the Phillips hue app or would I just run it through the Amazon echo?  Right and that's a real question for people who are partnering too because Phillips hue wants my email address  It wants all this data and information for itself. But if it's going through the Amazon echo  How does it feel about that? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and yet they packed in a hue bulb in the in the package. So they're well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that that are they I mean did Amazon actually because you know Amazon doesn't always  Ask about this stuff. It's like hey, we got some we had some hue bulbs in inventory. Let's toss these in that's true. That's true  Sweetened the deal. I assume that's not what happened. But you know, I would not put it past Jeff Bezos. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think Matt you you have Google Home I'm assuming throughout throughout your home, but what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have a Google Home. I also have the Amazon equivalent  I am I am breaking new pioneering waves in dumb home technology  So, you know just the just the amount of work to try to control a lot of this stuff  I'm like, you know what? I'll just get up and turn off the light switch myself, you know, so  I'm like adding a skill to this and then you got a reboot  So I'm just I'm playing around with going super super dumb and and just you know  Trying to use those cycles for other things these days. So we'll see whether that works out  I'll report back on the experiment, but I gotta say like  There's so many devices that Amazon announced today  It's like they've just decided to make echo its own like consumer brand, you know, like the echo buttons sound pretty cool  But it doesn't sound like they have anything to do with sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, so the echo buttons this is this is kind of a strange one  If you were ever hoping to turn your echo into a game show, we've all been there  Now you can these buttons are for interacting with echo  Devices for family. Well, not just family games  But for games trivia was one example that they used so so basically you get a two-pack for  $20 and that'll be that'll release timed with the holidays  But it's it's kind of like that. What was it staples had their big like easy button easy button or whatever  It's kind of like that  But it works with the echo devices so that you can kind of ring in and has a little an LED light that lights it up  I don't know. Is it that one came out of nowhere? But I mean I can understand like that would probably actually be very fun  It's the first in Amazon's Alexa gadgets lineup. So there will be more in this gadgets category. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think this is awesome and I'll tell you what I'll tell you. Yeah, tell us why I  Love gameplay my daughter and I actually we did the Jeopardy skill  We also do would you rather because she's a tween girl and that's like the best game for tween girls  So I can see us having a total fun. It's like totally a stocking stuff for a kind of idea, right?  It's $20 for a two-pack for is it?  No  $20 for two  That's that's nothing. The other thing is if you're a clever developer, you could start building this into skills  So, you know Amazon's got their IOT button, but that's 20 bucks and you have to be pretty adept  to code like a skill for your IOT button, but like I  Spent forever doing a skill for did I feed the dog? So in our house, you know, who knows who feeds the dog?  You know, we just it's just a common question. So we actually put  emotion sensor on the dog food  Container so when we lifted it, you know, it would send a text to everybody  but I wanted to do an echo skill for the longest time to be like this go like did we feed the dog and  She would tell you yes or no with this button  I could stick it right next to the dog food whoever opens and feeds the dog  They just hit the button and then when we ask that question to the echo not each other  We'll get an answer  So I feel like there's a lot of really cool opportunities for being able to press a button to indicate to your personal assistant  That lives in your house that something's happened, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely, and then I mean technically, you know, even this button has an LED and it maybe it changes to a different color when you  And that way if you don't ask me just happen to be standing there you see this blue you go, okay already done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know see even even smarter. Look at you  Well, you know, I am a developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not at all are the dishes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they clean? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, so then but that that turns this like Amazon really build this as being for for games  But I mean really maybe the game part is just an example of some of the unique ways that you can use this and  Let developers run wild with it and see what they come up with. I  like that  Let's see here. What else do we have? We have the echo spot, which is an alarm clock  With Amazon's voice assistant baked baked in as all of these things have a two point five inch circular screen design device  It has the ability, you know, so it's got a full screen there you can view cameras hold video calls, of course  Watch video news. I'm sure you can watch videos on there  If you really wanted to although the circular screen might make that weird, but it has the ability to control your smart home  Bluetooth capability 3.5 millimeter stereo cable if you want to take your audio out  Into your home, you know into your bedroom  Let's say have speakers and a setup there so that you wake up to nice pleasing music. Maybe Katy Perry or someone  $129 ships in December pre-order now was this the other device that you were really excited about Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I  was excited about this and then I learned about the the camera feature and then I was like  Oh if I could do a video call on this that means there's a camera and that means I don't want to put it next to  My bed, right? I mean, I I do actually trust Amazon quite a bit  But I don't trust anybody that much unless there's like a hard shutter for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's so cute. Yeah, I mean it's cool  I mean, yeah  Maybe maybe you get that and you throw the little little of the tape over the the camera and then you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you really need to use it, but then then you eliminate the cool cute design. I mean, it's  So someone someone called it chumbee for it's Amazon's chumbee and it is it's yeah, it's exactly that so I'm like  Welcome back chumbee

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We missed you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The button is my favorite thing the little LED game buttons, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're fine and not to mention inexpensive so you can get a ton of yeah  Yeah, and everything that I've read about the spot is that it's considered like a  Discounted Amazon show so if you had reservations about Amazon show with the camera and everything  I mean coupled with the the alarm clock that means it's almost destined to end up in your bedroom  So, you know ask yourself whether you're okay with the fact that there's an internet connected camera hanging out in your bedroom  And if you're okay with that, then great go for it. If not, you know, maybe maybe think twice  Hmm  Yeah, you know you put it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you use it like a baby monitor? I'm sure I mean again there  I'm just thinking could you so you would drop in on it, but it wouldn't be always I'm just thinking through this  No, you shouldn't use it as a baby monitor. Never mind. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you know people that that is one of the use cases that they touted is that you can check in on  You know like a camera in baby's room to see how baby is doing  So I suppose it's one way to do it  It's just you know, you have to ask yourself the standard questions about a video camera  That's always connected to the internet and how safe or is our IOT stuff. Anyways, do we really know we think we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's not safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy on IOT would know the answer to that question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very comfortable telling you that you probably should avoid it. All right, there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's your advice the echo connect is a standalone box that that plugs into a standard phone jack  What is that? First of all, anyways  And then also into an echo device of your choosing to bring telephone calls to the echo speaker  so we talked a little bit about how the  The new smaller echo and I'm assuming the echo plus have the ability to do phone calls  Through there this is a box that allows your other maybe you're outdated your older echo device to also manage phone calls  And being that it's coming from your line your landline directly through the plug you get caller ID  You get the capability of doing 9-1-1 if you need to that's something that Google homes phone calling  Functionality is not able to do  So a little bit better there but kind of a little clunky also because you're plugging it into the wall  I don't know people still do that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't even have a phone check in my house, so when we built our house in 2012 we did not put

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any copper so like you're not getting one of these then

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just gonna say like I recently filled out a form and they're like, yeah  Just fax this back to this number and I'm like look I may be old-school  But I'm not an actual caveman like where are we gonna have a fax line with a landline where we can come on?  Scan that and email that to you. Yeah same difference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's literally the same thing except it's coming to you through your email and not through a phone line  But I'm still scanning it the way I would if I faxed it  Because that's how you do it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DC still has faxed. I'd like I remember like two years ago applying for press credentials for a Senate hearing and  They wanted me to fax something in and I was like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see this pro fax. There's a lot of things that  Technology has not completely  Saturated DC. Yeah, let's just put it like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you need a fax line kinkos, yeah, or is it is it the FedEx store now, I guess yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's FedEx. Yeah. Yeah, I believe I don't know  I'm trying to think of the last time I actually set foot in a kinkos or a FedEx store  It's been a long time probably the last time I need to send a fax actually. Yeah, that's right  Okay, so probably not selling a whole lot of those but Amazon also updated and it just keep coming the fire TV to include  60 frames per second 4k the previous version had 4k now  It's 60 frames per second, but it also now includes HDR support high dynamic range  it's a small flat dongle it hangs from the HDMI port behind or aside from your TV and  Yeah  HDR 10 support for HDR not Dolby vision Dolby Atmos support for audio  Which curiously Apple TV 4k which Apple announced a couple of weeks ago swaps that it actually supports Dolby  Vision for HDR and HDR 10 for audio. So, you know, they're they're just a little bit different  But this one's cost I think a decent amount less. It's $70 pre-order now for October 25th  Either view fire TV users, that's that's one set-top box that I've never gotten though  I've heard really good things about it, but I've never tested it out myself  Mmm Chromecast and Roku. Yeah. Yeah Chromecast for me. Yeah pretty much the same for me, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is weird though because now with the fire TV with the echo  You can do the cool stuff that you can do with Google Home in the Chromecast which is like play  What's it called big little lies or  I'm terrible. Okay, play Game of Thrones and HBO and it'll it'll do it for you  and so those that's that's actually a really cool thing to be able to do if but  Again, I'm not gonna I don't want to go and buy, you know  Oh, here's my fire TV because right now I've got this in my living room and I just just just get along you guys  Are we gonna talk about are we gonna?  Let Amazon and Google collide and talk about a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it not playing YouTube on the Echo show? Sure. Let's do it right now. In fact, I think that's right  Are we are we done with all of our Amazon announcements? I think so  They also had an announcement about BMW bringing them bringing their voice assistant to BMWs in 2018  But that's really all there is to that mid-year next year. They're gonna have far-field microphones throughout the cab  Inside the vehicle and have it integrated into the infotainment system  System  Not as flashy but interesting that all of these things are being embedded and baked into  The the interior of vehicles. I'm wondering what that means long term for the resale value of vehicles  Like five years from now, will that still be a thing and will it just be like, oh really you've got that in there  Yeah that that like fizzled and died a couple of years ago  Let's hope not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Built-in eight-track yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At some point it'll be outdated how long is that point who knows at this point, but yes, let's talk about the Amazon Echo show  This was not announced on stage obviously, but there's basically a brewing  Let's call it a kerfuffle between I was gonna go a brouhaha  I'm doing works as well a brouhaha kerfuffle  Same category I would say but it's YouTube and Amazon are basically there's something going on because YouTube no longer  Plays on the Echo show the Echo show of course is the screened echo device  It says when you try to do that  It says Google doesn't support YouTube on the device anymore. Google doesn't support YouTube on the device anymore  They don't just say this feature is not supported. They call Google out  verge contacted Amazon who said Google made the change based on what they said was no technical reason and  They also said that's very disappointing. It hurts their customers both of their customers  Google's saying that they're not living there. They're what how they're implementing YouTube on the device  Violates the terms of service that they've spelled out for  YouTube so no YouTube on your on your Echo show and I don't know if it's available through a browser on the device  Maybe but there isn't a browser on the Echo show. Well, then no then no, it's not. What do you think Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt opened his mouth so I was I was gonna let him go he was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing I was gonna say is that it reminds me in  2013 there was a a little bit of a brouhaha or a kerfuffle however you want to say it about  Microsoft wanted to get YouTube on Windows Phone. Yes, and and  It's a very sort of similar sounding argument where Microsoft was like  Oh, they're blocking us and Google was saying something along the lines of your you're scraping us when you're supposed to use this API  And so I you know, we'll see what happens whether they can come to a common miss a common understanding  I mean, it's definitely the case as a consumer  No matter what device you have you want to be able to you know  See all of your shows and watch all of your stuff  But like if I'm on Amazon  I would also expect to be able to buy it a Chromecast and an Apple TV and it sounds like sometimes Amazon even though you  Can buy almost anything on Amazon doesn't doesn't sell, you know some devices from other manufacturers. So it's  Understand why a company will have this sort of reaction on both sides, but as a consumer you just want everything to work together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so okay. Go for it. So Kevin actually brought this up on our show  so if you have apologies if you listen to both twig and our show, but  we talked about it and he said that it's possible that  Google is reacting to Amazon not because Amazon uses a forked version of Android  That they are maybe not agreeing or they're maybe not implementing the right licensing terms for  playing it on an  Not Android based device, but so that was his thought and he brought up the Windows thing as well  so I haven't had a chance to email Google and test that theory, but  it's  It might I mean it sounds very credible. So I was like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well and YouTube is a separate part of Google slash alphabet and so like there is  I remember seeing a YouTube app for I forget if it was the TiVo or the Xbox or the Xbox one  but like if you work at YouTube you want as many people as possible to be able to watch YouTube so  Hopefully we'll get more details about exactly where the breakdown happened and whether it can be fixed up. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hope so because my gosh my daughter and I watch our corgi videos at breakfast time on the Amazon show and  That is a treasured time and YouTube has the best corgi videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all know this everybody knows this even the Queen of England knows that I was gonna say even dogs know it even corgis know it  Yeah, that's a really good point I had not considered that  Stacey and by extension also Kevin  That yeah the smart one  the fire tablets  Don't have any of Google's apps on it because you know, they don't adhere to those things  They it's a forked version  So therefore if you want to get YouTube on there like I always think of YouTube when I think of YouTube I think of it  As being truly cross-platform like Google's, you know  Strategy is YouTube in all the screens and in all the places  But I mean it's actually not not true when you look at it that way and Amazon's no nothing to sneeze at as far as  You know the amount of eyeballs that could potentially hit YouTube  It's just YouTube doesn't end up on those devices if you want to actually install it on there  You have to jump through some hoops. You have to be very specific. You're not getting it through the Amazon App Store  So you have to kind of side load them?  Themselves yourself  That could be kind of part of what this is all about and that's us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean you have to side load Amazon's video stuff and Amazon's apps not all of them  But some of them the video playing ones you have to side load onto an Android handset used to which actually a couple anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No couple of weeks ago this only happened like two weeks ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My phone died so I switched

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon Amazon just released to the Play Store Amazon instant video a couple of weeks ago  You can download it you can't Chromecast with it because as we know Amazon is not very pro Chromecast  You know, they know the even though it's in the Play Store. You can't Chromecast  You can't even buy a Chromecast on Amazon site

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I understand so you can't know you can buy a nest thermostat. That's what boggles my mind is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, yeah, yeah, it's weird the strange lines that are drawn in the sand here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cannot buy a Google home there either in case you were wondering

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then is that Google is that Google saying no well  No, probably not Google would love to have their home sold in all the places. I would think you don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you can walk into an Apple store though or buy a Google home or an Amazon Echo either. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you can't buy an Apple TV on Amazon either. So I think it's probably Amazon that's saying no Chromecast  No Apple TV for you, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Hey, let's uh, let's take a break  Thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in Google and then we'll talk about more stuff  We've got more stuff to talk about before we do that.

That's rocket mortgage comm  Slash twig equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states  NML s consumer access org number 30 30 and we thank rocket mortgage by quick and loans for their support of this week in  Google  Let's see here  Oh real quick before we move out of Amazon because we missed this last week  And I'm actually stoked that you are both here because we can talk about it a little bit  So this is a little bit old news  But it's worth talking about because the intersection between Amazon and Google on this one is very strong  Financial Times reported that Amazon has its own smart glasses in the works  With oh here we go again  Bone conduction for audio so no in-ear design and if I remember correctly the original Google glasses or Google Glass did that  No screen no camera  So in many ways it would be addressing some of the critical components of glass that a lot of people that were critical of it  You know were were so because of the camera primarily it would still tether to your smartphone there  Apparently according to this report anyways, they're creating something that looks more like normal glasses. So not something  Sci-fi and and strange on your face. It would actually look like a regular pair of glasses  Connected glasses for firing off audio commands wherever you happen to be so basically it kind of seems like these are your Alexa glasses  Oops, I said the word these are your Amazon's voice assistant glasses  Because everywhere you happen to be you you want to you know talk to Amazon's voice assistant  So you might as well wear these glasses everywhere you go to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Apple did this so much better with air pods if like this is what this is it's like  AirPods as a way to get Siri in your ear, right?  So you can talk to her all day and you can have this without ever pulling out your phone, which is cool, right?  This is that with glasses and as someone who wears glasses, I'm like, yeah sure. Okay  But if you don't wear glasses, it's kind of weird and why wouldn't you just do like air pods or your  They call the ear sets headphones  Headphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your your pods or yeah in-ear headphones, whatever like there's there's the rumor that Google's probably  Possibly going to be releasing something along what you're talking about at next week's event and they're all they're all doing the same stuff, aren't they?  Yeah, I mean do we want a pair of glasses with a microphone in it snap, you know snapchat did their snap  Their snap glasses again now I'm forgetting what they were even spectacles. There we go. Thank you Carson  Spectacles, they did their spectacles and I remember at the time, you know and myself included I was like, alright  They did it right and I realized in retrospect. I was just totally pulled into the hype

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they fired their team who cares their whole spectacles team really it's it  They don't have it anymore. The information reported that like two weeks ago. I missed that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I missed that  Okay  So then that didn't work out so well  I mean do we need to go into smart glasses territory again? Haven't we done this a couple of times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think I just don't understand if you don't have a screen why you need glasses?  I mean, I find you don't have a camera but the screen for a heads-up display seems really like an opportunity that they're not taking  I don't know Matt you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I you know until there's a useful screen I will probably hold off  But I will say like if they had glasses that had a useful screen  That that's a little bit of the dream right because I mean then you could do some pretty amazing things, but  I'll be curious to see what this actually turns out to be because it's a you know  Amazon does a very good job of having a clear purpose like they oh, here's a device  We can plug a phone in and you're able to have a phone line  You know that they don't just like throw  They don't just throw out devices that don't have a purpose  So I but I don't quite get what the purpose of this device would be so maybe maybe that'll become more clear as we get  closer or if they release it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Feel like the echo look didn't have a purpose. I  Think is Amazon starts playing with this stuff. They're getting a  Maybe a little further from things that have a useful function. I don't know but yes still

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm with you. Well, yeah  It kind of feels like Amazon right now is is firmly in the let's throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks territory  Because I mean, you know in today's announcements were not insignificant  but boy were there a lot of them and you have to imagine with that with that amount of  Product announced at one time some of that's gonna rise at the top and some of it's gonna be like, okay  Well, we didn't see a second iteration of that because yeah, I just didn't go anywhere  And I mean hey, it's not like Amazon's hurting so they have the ability to  Throw all this stuff at the wall. Why not do it? I just don't see any purpose for having a pair of glasses  That's just and you know and a voice assistant microphone, which is kind of what it sounds like it is  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Today was the first day where it really felt like Amazon was throwing a bunch of different stuff against the wall  And like, you know you think about the Nexus Q, you know, like you can have a really good idea really good execution but  The ability to get to people's mindshare, you know  Is everybody gonna learn about what the look is versus the this versus the that it's um  That's a harder sell. So and it has to be a magical combination of what it actually offers and how much it actually costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which was the failing of one of the failings of the Nexus Q is yeah, nobody's gonna buy it for that price

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's maybe a great that octopus thing  Black octopus thing that did something with your television

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and that's pretty pretty much the marketing strategy for it was just what you said there  That's about as obvious as it was at the time. I thought it was more audio. Yeah  So it's no you plug it into your TV. No, you're right. You're right. It was a  However, it was also partially audio because it had  Strangely it had actual speaker an amplifier inside of it and  Speaker outputs to drive a pair of speakers like, you know stand-up speakers  so it would bypass your any amplifier that you're likely to have and  It would act as your amplifier and be your stereo essentially for just that stuff, which was just play movies play TV  YouTube content and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Play music that's all it could I wonder I wonder what it's like to be a part of a team  Where you know?  As soon as it gets announced or pretty shortly after that you're like it was a great idea. You worked really hard  It's a beautiful device. Sorry this Juicero or whatever it is that you've worked on  You know, it's just not gonna work out and then you've got like well  I made a thing and I made a physical artifact in this world and it's really well designed  The price point isn't right or it doesn't meet what people are looking for or the company just doesn't want to get behind it  That's got to be frustrating. Oh, I can't even imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all comes back around the chubby doesn't it and we're back  It's true though. You spend all that time the device  I mean I have it in my office because we got it, you know  But Google I owe that year and I'm proud to have it because I remember when it came out  It was really a symbol of like Google's taking hardware in-house. We did we designed this we did this all in-house  This is what we're capable of and it was just you know  There were there were parts of the execution  Maybe not necessarily with the hardware itself  but there were other parts where you just kind of scratch your head and wondered why is this so limited in use and why is it  three times more expensive than everything else and  Why is there an amplifier in there?  Is that why it's three times more expensive than everything else because I didn't need an amplifier  There were just a lot of questions, but hey, you know now Google has a lot happening in hardware  so I think the the  You know the the roses that come from a situation like that that those people that worked on that can smell  That's weird. That's a weird way to put this  Is is that it leads to other things, right?  It got Google through this awkward beginning stage and got them to where they are now  Producing a lot of really great hardware that people do we all have an ugly adolescence

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, really yeah, it paved the way we couldn't get where we were now without having you know, these sorts of experiences  Yes, those pimples and I was like there's its embraces. It was the cue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Embraces years. Yes. Oh, I wanted to bring this up. It's not a Google thing  But when I was at CDA was it two weeks ago?  I don't I've been all over the place since then but I saw these  Because you mentioned the BMW thing, but there were these amplifiers and speakers that were built  They were you put them in your ceiling. They were made by a company called origin acoustics and  They had little echo dots so you would buy the echo dots you would pop it into this little speaker amplifier thing  You would pop that into your ceiling. So you'd have a much better speaker  You'd have power for the dot but then you'd have basically  Wherever however many speakers you had in your room, you'd have the mics for the echo  So basically it turns your room into like an an echo chamber  I  Thought that was actually kind of a really neat idea and I loved it  Like it's a great way to think about using the dot form factor to put  You know once you start adding context to those rooms  Then it becomes really powerful to be like hey, madam a turn off the lights and if it knew like where you were then poof  That would happen in that room. I don't know  I just kind of got really excited about that and I was like  When are we gonna see something like that from Google or even Apple for home kit? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm just throwing that out there for you. That is not an inexpensive upgrade either the amplifier retails for $1,500  this is like  echo dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is this is cdS  So this is basically your alternative there is to buy a fancy speaker to go in your ceiling. Anyway, these are good speakers  They're not I got you dot speakers got it  So Matt you with your phone  Probably would not go for this. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would not but then I would argue my life would be simpler as a result. So  Which would leave me more time to read tech news like the fact that Bill Gates uses an Android phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice  Yeah, I couldn't believe that told Fox News Sunday that he now uses an Android phone. He did not mention the model  But he says he has quote a lot of Microsoft software on it, which I'm not not surprising  But Microsoft's been doing a lot in Android  There's been doing a lot in general building up their software for  What would be competing platforms to its own mobile operating system if that was really as much of a thing as maybe it used to be  It's not much anymore  But yeah, I guess not surprising that if he has one he would be loaded with Microsoft apps  But I guess you know my thought on this is  Microsoft's made it really easy to be an Android user and still be all-in on Microsoft  Services and this is one example of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like the switch over to Satya Nadella  like I understand how Microsoft would be attached to the Windows platform, but  Windows phone not doing well might ultimately be a really good thing for Microsoft because they're like, okay  Let's get back to our roots making great software for lots of different devices and lots of different situations and they have that core competency  You know the the hyperlapse app  There's a ton of really not just you know, the normal bread-and-butter core apps like office or what-have-you but  like it for me  It's it's really refreshing to see that this is like another act for Microsoft and personally  It's one that I really love because it's like, okay  Let's get back to competing on the merits rather than like, okay  we were able to have this platform and therefore that that started us out on second or third base and  And I think if you look at Microsoft in the last few years they have done some really incredible stuff, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the quality Azure is a super awesome platform  Like I know that AWS gets all the credit for lots of things, but there are a lot of businesses on Azure  There are a lot of really interesting things like their confidential compute effort. I thought that was really cool  So, you know, they're building a very credible  Tech company still or they have a credible tech company still Microsoft you're gonna be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The scrappy upstart Microsoft's gonna do alright, I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's just it's a switch, you know  it's it's a different philosophy compared to how they were for like a lot of the  2010 or 2000s

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's a big change in their philosophy. But then at the same time like like you point out  It's it's also kind of a return to form. They've really focused on their software  they've also built in features that make it really easy to be on iOS and Android and  Still kind of live integrated in the Microsoft world Windows 10 has features that improve that interoperability  They also, you know allow things like resuming your work on your mobile device from the work that you're doing in your desktop and  Stuff like that. So, you know in to that degree  It doesn't really matter which mobile OS you're using the services still work between and that's just as good  Someone pointed out in the chat room. Sorry, it just whizzed by there, but that you know  Just as a reminder Mary Jo Foley Windows Weekly. That's the phone that she uses as an Android as well. She says  That Microsoft services work well on Android. So hey does the trick then it doesn't matter a whole lot  But it's nice to know Bill Gates is on our side  Nice to have you Bill  Good to have you here. Hey, should we talk a little bit about well last week  We mentioned that Google was considering  Making some changes to address what the EU had charged, you know 2.4 2 billion dollar  Euro antitrust ruling based on how Google was treating its search results around  Shopping and you know compared to competitors that were also appearing in that in that area  So that happened part of that agreement even though Google is is  Is going back and appealing the ruling part of the agreement is that Google needs to make changes to make it fit more fair  you know in the interim and beyond and  We had talked a little bit about about their potential plan last week. Well that has actually happened  They're doing what they were planning on so basically they're gonna allow competitors to bid for and  They're gonna be you know reselling ad space up at the top of search results in Europe  On their Google home page Google is also going to be bidding on those auctions as well against the  Competitors that are coming in to also go for those spaces  Google apparently has a cap that it's set for itself that it can't pass  Google apparently has a cap that it's set for itself that it can't pass  But you know a lot of the competitors saying well, this is no good now Google's, you know, just gonna make  You know make all sorts of money off of this  They're gonna have to pay high rates in order to win those auctions because Google's in the in the game as well  And you know has the money to back it up  They say it's it's operating as a separate business in these auctions to be fair to competitors. Google says this  What do you guys think is this a good kind of way to tackle the the antitrust?  Issue that the EU has has dropped on Google's lap. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait are they so that you're gonna be able to bid against Google  Yeah, Google's cap then would probably become your floor if Google wants that space. That's the challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so, okay  Make sure I have this I know  You and when you put it in that term then it almost sounds like well, wait a minute  That's not fair because ultimately Google ends up winning right they did they just like in a well, I don't know  What do you think that I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean it it sounded more like there will be bidding and then there will be a limit above which  Google might not go and then if people wanted to go above that then they're guaranteed  but I thought the other article in the rundown was also super interesting because it it sort of  It was in Bloomberg. It sort of says  The remedy that Google proposes will be tested by asking Google's competitors what they think of it and  if you follow the history of the  investigation that the European Commission did like  Even even after they made their big, you know decision they they didn't prescribe and say hey Google  Here's what you did wrong. And here's what you should do to fix it. They were like, hey Google  Here's what you think you did wrong. What do you think you should do to fix it? And so  It's really interesting that they're like, how do we know if Google's fixed it?  We're gonna ask the people who complained and see if they like it or not. And I don't know something about that  I have I have a lot of opinions, but that just seems a little strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Strange that the competitors would be would have such a powerful role in determining whether it's whether it's the right direction or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if the final arbiter is whether the people who complained are happy  you know, there was there was at least one that was funded by Microsoft and now there's a detente where like  Microsoft agreed not to sort of fund some of those anti  Google lobbying groups like icon and that sort of stuff I believe and so a lot of those pressures have sort of ratcheted down a  little bit  But you know, why should shopping comparison engines show up and as opposed to say Amazon or eBay?  Well, if it was the comparison shopping engines that complained rather than Amazon or eBay then  Asking what the right decision or remedy is to the shopping comparison engines  You're probably going to end up with a result that is a little more favorable to shopping comparison engines  And it's is it don't it's a little unclear to me if that's really what consumers want or if they'd rather have like a place  Like Amazon or eBay where they can actually, you know buy an object as opposed to  Comparing and doing another level of trying to look for where things would be so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I wonder how long it's going to take for us to realize or for us to learn how the competitors  Do actually feel I mean if this goes into effect right away. I'm sure it won't take very long  It seems like early on they are not feeling very strongly about this as being a solution  You know, I think they're they're worried that ultimately this just means that they end up paying more for you know, similar  I guess what I was saying as far as like, you know, all it does is benefit Google is  If Google has the ability like you were saying Stacey of always  Bidding up to a cap then no matter what I mean, technically they could just always do that  Right and no matter what they're always making more than that and that could benefit Google greatly in that regard  But that would also probably not be that fair  And the people that are judging the competitors would be very vocal about that  So maybe that would be the who hasn't yeah who hasn't ever gamed a charity auction just to bid up, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The price for your charity see it's it's true. It's the same sort of theory. Yeah, except not for charity. So I don't know  for a good internal charity  Yeah, I will have to see how it goes if it is an auction though, then there is a little bit of a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I will have to see how it goes if it is an auction though  Then there is a little bit of an economic incentive to not overbid. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll see how it all turns out. Yes. Yes  Before we get to our final ad and then tips and tricks and picks and anything else that rhymes with that those words  Are there any final stories that you wanted to talk about that we didn't jump to and oh, oh, yes matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes  Calling in from dc. Hi long time  Just the fact that the on the iphone they are switching to uh away from bing  To use google search results in syrian spotlight like that's a pretty big change  That's another one where I really wish I could be a fly on the wall to hear all the different  Negotiations and and what exactly happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, ios and mac os users are gonna now get siri  Get web search in siri pointed to google search not being although being will still be the default engine for image search  And then youtube of course will be the default engine for video search  But this this seems to be timed with mac os high sierra ios 11  Coming out, but yeah that that really does seem like a big big change since since the beginning. It's always been bing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was google for was it well  I think it was in ios. I think siri might have always been bing or you know,  Apple was tilting it towards being for quite a while. So, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now if only the amazon echo could sign a similar deal  So it's because when you ask the amazon echo a question you get to bing and bing is not as satisfactory as google  I don't see that happening. But  Oh, what happens with the home pod do you think that would go to bing or do you think I mean because it doesn't have a  That would be a competing product against google assistant basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh good question that question even makes sense  Uh-huh  It may yeah, I don't know the answer obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I mean none of us do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I yeah, i'm not really quite sure what that will mean  Uh for the home pod when does the home pod i'm looking it up right December comes out in december. Okay, theoretically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's the stated date for now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, and now that i'm looking at the home pod i'm like, oh the smaller amazon echo has the same kind of  full body mesh thing going on  They're all going in that direction aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I don't appreciate the full body mesh or even the partial mesh that like the google home has i'm just kind of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just make it all plastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't really just stick it up in the ceiling. Oh wait, no, i've got it  Just work with my existing sonos and then i'm fine. Yes, because i've already got those exactly exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I know one last one real quick and then I promise we will get to the ad and tips and tricks and all that kind of  stuff twitter  jumping from 140 characters to 280 characters, how do we feel about this uh pending change that's probably going to happen that's rolling out to  test users right now  Doubling the amount of characters basically  It's a complicated issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we all we all have thoughts. I cannot I cannot believe that this was their response to  Hey, dude, the president of the united states has you know, like not started a war  Let's say really mortally offended north korea and we might end up, you know in like world war three because of it  So twitter, what's your role in all this and twitter's like, you know what?  I have an idea. This is just add more characters. Let's just do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People need to be the ability to say more of those words look at more nuanced arguments and attacks i'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it's funny how a lot of people have asked for the ability to edit tweets  And so there was there was at least one where people were like, can we get the ability to edit tweets and like look?  Everything's rounded now. Okay, but can I edit tweets? Look much more room?  Uh, but you know was it frost who said, you know, the whole part about poetry is constraints  So it'll be it'll be interesting if we're still complaining in here like, oh 280 is not enough or or how we'll look at it  I'll be curious. Yeah, because we all got  Sorry, we got really angry about the likes or the stars or whatever on twitter and now it's hard to or you know  Nobody it it was fine. Sometimes there's just change aversion. So absolutely it's change aversion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know i'm guilty of that when I first saw it. I was like, yes, this is great  How many times am I editing down my you know?  Removing vowels and adding symbols in order to make a thing fit into a single tweet  So this will help with that and then the more I thought about it the more I was like wait a minute now  Instead of seeing little blurbs. I'm going to start seeing paragraphs and am I okay with that?  And so i'm really back and forth. I'm trying not to hate it for changes sake  but  There twitter did point out that in japan the service, you know  many if not most of the words  Represented by symbols so 140 characters means something very different in japan than 140 characters in the english language

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say that felt very much like post rationalization right now. That's like  Yeah in japan, uh, they can totally say a lot more because their language is pictograms. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if that's 140 words versus 140 characters and they're and they say only one percent of the tweets there use all 140 characters  I don't know that's that percentage of their tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What percentage of their users or tweets are sent in japanese compared to english or?  russian or any other  I mean that's  Again, that felt like i'm in the marketing team here. Let's tell them this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't have a thing because i'm traveling and many of my recent things have been  Installed slash they don't fit in suitcases. So instead  I have a great book for you guys. Um, so this is  This is a science book. It's about the five previous extinctions. So  We probably know about like the the triassic extinction. We're uh, not the dinosaurs  Was that the dinosaurs the drasic was the dinosaurs anyway?  Okay, I did read this book I promise you guys  It's it's basically like a geo geology  Book, but it's written really well peter branon is the author and he does a great job  making  the subject both accessible but  Interesting and then also relevant for today because it talks about  My gosh the the overarching  I guess the elephant in the room here is climate change and what we are doing  Are we heading towards the next big extinction?  and  I just as a sciency kind of person. I really enjoyed it as a writer. I enjoyed his writing  I'm gonna tell you guys though that my husband tried to read it and he was like  But he reads more like malcolm gladwell business books that benefit him  So this is probably more like if you're intellectually curious about things it was it was a fun book for that that  those people so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, does it make you wonder if the world is going to end and if so, is that fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um, you know, I  I'm here at a security conference right now. So i'm like the world, you know it might end  But we might all just screw everything up before that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a million reasons this could all go wrong  Don't just think it's just the world ending. It's all these other reasons, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like in geologic time  You know is the world gonna in a way it was kind of comforting because you know  The world actually ending because of our climate change and like mass species extinction  Actually, this is going to take like a thousand years, you know, so  That's oddly comforting. We might be really unhappy for the last 600 or even

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  800 of it, but you know, we'll still be here but at least we'll still be here  We might not want to be here, but we will be that's something and we'll be we'll be tweeting 280 characters at a time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you very much. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More space to talk about our feelings of existential dread

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Until it gets cut down to five characters and that lead that that helps  That helps us not enjoy our time of whatever time we do have  Um, all right. Excellent. So that is the ends of the world  And volcanic apocalypses lethal oceans and our quest to understand earth's past mass extinctions  If you want to check it out, there you go. There it is on amazon. Is there an audio book? Yeah  There's an audio book so you can listen to it as well. That might be fun to read. Yeah, right down my alley  Matt what's your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna go from mass extinctions to a story of hope and happiness which is  There's a lot of stuff in dc that people have opinions about but  Everybody in dc that i've talked to really thinks that government could do better at technology being more effective and more efficient  And so one of the projects that we've worked on is called vets.gov. It's a one-stop shop where veterans or if you know  Someone who's a veteran, please let them know about it. You can discover apply manage and track your benefits  So everything from pension to burial benefits to g.i bill comparison tools  And we just passed a really big milestone  Plus veterans have applied for health care benefits through this site  It's really wild because previously they would often have to use a paper form and they would have to wait over 100 days on average  Now half of them get information within 10 minutes  So I want to use this as a slight pitch to just say if you are listening  To this podcast if you're watching right now  This is a small team of people who who by building a web form were able to get more veterans their health benefits  We've also got specific projects where we're trying to make it so that patients and doctors  Can have better health care so not just paying for the number of tests that they do  But actually the quality of care how often do people come back to hospitals?  There's also projects  Like at the small business administration  We had a person start this week and from his oath ceremony basically walked him straight over to the small business administration  Where he's helping with some of the disaster relief loan stuff related to the the recent hurricanes  So there's a ton of really interesting projects  Even soldiers, you know if you're moving across the country if you have a change of station that can be really stressful  Trying to make that a more seamless better more efficient experience is something that's really important  So whether it's something like bug bounties the federal government didn't have any kind of bug bounty until last year and the us  Digital service specifically starting at the pentagon ran the very first one  So if you have skills in you know site reliable in engineering  Uh engineering in general software engineering if you are a designer if you're a product manager  Consider doing a tour, you know six months  Maybe a year at the us digital service because there are a lot of great projects to work on and some really interesting things to tackle as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my oh my gosh  matt  A couple weeks ago. My husband sent me a chat and he was like stacy  You should talk to matt cuts about using iot in the us government because  I believe you tweeted about having your veterans affairs stuff attached to like a raspberry pie and a dashboard. That's like  showing people  so  I was I was really excited. I was like, oh I should I should talk to him about using iot in the government  So this sounds very cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting projects and even though the work is often hard  sometimes it's frustrating and sometimes the projects don't work out like i'm not going to sugarcoat it but  At the end of the day you go home and you're like, okay something got better not just for  10 americans or a thousand americans, but often 10 000 100 000 a million americans and that is  That is something that you can feel really good about  So there's there's all kinds of interesting projects and hard problems to solve  But also leveling up your skills working with different parts of the government and partners at different agencies  It's it's been a wild experience and i'd recommend it for anybody to give it a try because you can really help a lot of people

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome work. Um, that sounds fantastic. My dad is a veteran. I know how how challenging it can be at times for for veterans  in a lot of these in a lot of these facilities, so  Uh fantastic work and that's got to feel good for you man  Considering what you're doing. I know you did you did a lot of really great cool things for an insane amount of people at google, but  Uh, I don't know at some point. It's it's nice to kind of get that higher purpose  You know what I mean to be able to really get people's lives and i'm sure that's exactly where you're at right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you're experiencing it's great to work with the teams. They're inspirational and and just coming into work every day  It's a pleasure to work with them. Yeah right on excellent stuff. Uh, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gov  um mine is  Well for those of you who have a google home you probably have been asking I know I was probably from day one  Why you couldn't set reminders on the google home if you could do it in assistant because you're in your kitchen  You're doing things  It's it's like the the the ideas of what you need to do come to you when you least expect it when you're busy doing  Something else you're doing the dishes you're zoning out and suddenly you think I need to do that thing  I'll totally remember to do that thing and then you end up end the dishes and then you realize you didn't remember to do  That thing when it's too late  Now you can set a reminder on your google home and I try I worked with it yesterday a little bit and it works  Really well you say okay g remind me at whatever time uh to do this thing  And then it asks you to confirm it you save it once that time hits your google home will like go  It does it lets out this little chirp for you and says I have a reminder for  Jason and so then if you look at your google home, you'll see the single led light is permanently lit  On the top. It's like a notification dot so that tells you you have a notification waiting for you  So then when you go to your google home, you say okay. Gee, what's my reminder or what's up or however?  You want to phrase that pretty smart it picks up on it and it reads back your reminder  And the dot goes away  And so you've kind of erased that off and you can do that thing that you wanted to remember how to do it  Also ends up syncing into your email if you've got it set up to do that already for your reminders to appear in your inbox  Which I do also appears in your notification shade on your android device  So it's a great way to fire off a reminder. Finally, you can do it with google home  They just rolled that out a couple of days ago  And I think it's pretty much working on all google homes at this point. So  Check it out. It comes in really handy  That's that  If you didn't know now, you know  And that I think for the episode is that as well this was a lot of fun you guys thank you so much  For for coming on and making it easy for me.
