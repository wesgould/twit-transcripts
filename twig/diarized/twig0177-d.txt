This is Twig this week in Google to show the covers of the Google but also the cloud, the Twitter, the Facebook and today the Instagram.  Gina Trapani is here, founding editor of Lifehacker.com. She's of course a blogger at SmarterWare.org, a programmer who's written to do dot text and think up.  And I bet she's pretty happy. We're going to ask her about the new Twitter policy. She is joining us from San Diego. Hello Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello and brand new co-host of All About Android. Oh yeah, it's public now. We can tell the world. Yes, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're really thrilled. The founding host, Eileen Rivera, got a job with Google, which I think causes her to be recused.  She couldn't cover anything with it had to do with Google. So that pretty much eliminates her on the Android show. So we got Gina though.  I think that's great. In fact, you'll add the developer's perspective, which is fantastic. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't possibly replace Eileen. I know Eileen started a sort of a labor of love, right? I mean, it was a show she wanted to do herself.  She's done so amazing. I'm not going to replace her, but I'm really honored to have the opportunity.  And I never thought I would do a podcast and now I'm doing three. So I'm not going anywhere. Folks in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not. Yeah, they were worried you might leave this show. You better not. No, no, absolutely not.  We cannot replace you guys. It wouldn't allow that to happen. No, no, no, we want more Gina, not less. More Gina's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hopefully you won't be sick of me once I start doing all that Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I know Jason and Ronna are really thrilled to have you on board. So you don't start till next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I start January 8th, I think is our first show. Perfect. Is my first show. Next year isn't so far off. Not so far off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, I think this is the last show of this year for us. We can Google next week is a best of episode day after Christmas.  And then the week following we'll be here, but I'll be here. But you guys won't.  We just just turns out that you're all busy. It's OK. I'm sorry.  OK, sorry. Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York where he teaches journalism.  He's also, of course, an acclaimed author. His latest book, Public Parts, his blog is at BuzzMachine.com.  And from search engine land, Danny Sullivan. We love having Danny on.  Absolutely the most astute observer of search has been doing it for when did you start?  It was search engine watch when you started. When did you start that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  96. Wow. There was no Google in 96. There wasn't any Google in 96.  What did you cover? Alta Vista?  What's that? It was Alta Vista. It was Magellan. It was like us. It was Galaxy.  It was a mess. It's Google and Bing. Google and also rands in Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Hey, I like I like we talked about this last week. I think I think Marissa, you know, it's like a train pulling out of the station where it goes.  And I think they're starting to gain a little steam on this Yahoo train. The new Flickr app is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not as good yet. If only something had happened to cause them to.  If only something could really inspire people to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the problem. You can make this great app, but everybody's using something else. They're never going to switch over unless something happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of an instant. Insta kind of mess up. Scandal or change or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the gate, the gates of Instagram. Unfortunately, the Android version is quite as feature rich as the iPhone version, which is spectacular.  I'm sure we'll catch up soon, though, on the Android side. So Flickr.  But Flickr released a photo sharing app that shares to Flickr. In fact, I renewed my Flickr Pro because of this.  Yay. I've already posted something. One of the nice things about the Flickr app on Android, like many Android apps, you can choose the camera.  Once you take a picture, it has something very Instagram like a series of filters along the bottom.  And you've got to figure the program. You can turn them off in settings. You don't have to have them.  But I like, you know, the filters are nice. You could take a really boring picture of cables and turn them into something lovely and abstract.  Filters are like the Cool Whip. It's Cool Whip. It's Cool Whip. It's a la mode. Not what's Cool Whip. It's Cool Whip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an artificial chemical addition that we get. It's a la mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, you know, there's a lot of photographers who are doing quite well with Cool Whip. Don't knock Cool Whip.  So we talked about this last week, but the reason it's germane, it's almost as if they planned it, is Instagram kind of put a foot in its mouth this week,  announcing new terms of service. And the New York Times report was the one that I thought was most complete.  The CNET kind of got it wrong. And I think, unfortunately, CNET said Instagram wants to sell your photos.  And that became the story and an easy thing for Instagram to deny.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we don't want to sell your photos.  Although, technically, they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but Neelai Patel pointed out in The Virgin, Neelai does this, he's real good at analyzing terms of service because he is, in fact, a lawyer.  And he pointed out that, you know, the old terms of service were much more open-ended and gave you a lot, gave Instagram a lot of rights, which they just didn't assert.  So the new terms of service, they became more explicit.  But the things they asserted were kind of kind of scary.  Things like we were, you know, let me read you some of these.  Now, they've actually backed out, haven't they, Danny? This is maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that always confuses everybody is the same problem with Facebook is you have to license your photo or your content to the platform you're using so that they can replicate it for you in various formats on various servers.  So that part is, you know, is OK. But to then use your likeness on the flower barrel would be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jenna Wortham and Nick Bilton wrote about this a couple of days ago.  And their summary, again, this is the old terms of service.  Instagram has not issued revised terms of service, but they said, all right, we're going to back down.  Instagram can share information about its users with Facebook, its parent company, as well as outside affiliates and advertisers.  I'd be shocked if they weren't doing that.  Of course, you could star in an advertisement without your knowledge.  This doesn't mean they're going to sell your image.  But like and I think it's somewhat like Facebook sponsored posts.  This is the quote.  You agree that a business or other entity may pay us.  This is why people thought they were selling photos.  But that wasn't I didn't think that was going to happen.  May pay us to display your username, likeness, photos, along with any associated metadata and or actions you take in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions without any compensation to you.  I could see why people were a little miffed about that.  But Facebook does something very similar, right?  Mark Rotenberg said that the use of a person's likeness and that's could run into state laws.  He's with the epic, the Epic Electronic Privacy Information Center could run into some state laws limiting the use of person's name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent.  This is one that bothered me under age users not exempt.  Although Instagram says people must be 13 years old to sign up for the service, the new terms note if a teenager signs up, they're agreeing that a parent or guardian is aware that their image username and photos can also be used in ads.  Bad enough you're advertising to kids, but to start using their images in ads.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But so they're saying that these teenagers are letting their parents know about this, right?  So they have to put that into for COPPA, right?  So they have to that's their way of sort of saying part of our terms of service that user, you know, the teenager agreed that they let their parents know because, you know, we're not going to let them know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And believe me, my 13 year old totally reviewed all this stuff with me and got my permission and it was all sorted out.  And I said, you go right away.  This one really bothered me.  Actually, you know what he said when I mentioned this last night?  I get to be in an ad.  That's going to make money off it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you don't get paid, but you get to be in an ad.  Most kids would go, yeah, that's cool.  He was totally not bothered.  No, my kids neither.  Quote, you acknowledge we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content or commercial communications as such.  Now, Twitter does.  That bothers me a lot.  That's just wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Content creators, right?  We all have that, you know, that's like the golden rule, right?  Is you let people know when something's an ad.  That's the thing that really bugged me.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other stuff, which isn't really a term type of thing.  It's just potentially a violation of some advertising laws and certainly best practices.  But it's like, wow, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, yeah, I just expect to see the word promoted or sponsored next to things that are ads on Facebook.  You know, that says promoted or sponsors on Twitter, promoted users are labeled as such when you in search results.  Promoted tweets are labeled as such.  I just I expect that on blogs.  I expect that in all sort of media experiences.  This is the thing, like if Leo likes, I don't know, Stamps.com on Facebook and I see an ad that says, hey, your friend Leo likes Stamps.com.  Yes, that's an endorsement.  But that's also like Leo.  That was an action that Leo took on the service.  He's my friend.  So for me to see it feels like, OK, you know, I mean, it's getting surfaced because this brand presumably paid for it to get surfaced.  But that doesn't feel as bad to me as it not being labeled.  There seem to be a couple of differences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First of all, Facebook, as you can see here, puts it under a column that says sponsored.  And they also but this I mean, this they also only show me likes from my social graph from my friends.  So, you know, if here's a Neil Dash liking Facebook developers, for instance.  Now, Neil isn't do it did not do an explicit endorsement of Facebook developers.  He liked that page.  Liking means a lot of things, by the way, in Facebook terms does not mean you like it.  It means you associated with it in some way.  But Neil is not getting that is that is an implicit endorsement that Neil maybe did not want.  But at least it's only going to a Neil's friends. Right.  Instagram is not saying that.  Instagram is saying, you know, we could show it anywhere, anytime.  And if it's me, I don't want that.  I'm not going to I don't want Instagram using my image and endorsements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's there's a bunch of issues here as a whole whole raft of issues.  Well, when I went to time it when I was a time, I can start a magazine, a wise editor there said, listen, the rule is really simple.  The reader should never be confused about the source of content.  If it ever does it pay for it, you say it. That's all these rules.  We have just come down to that.  It's it's that simple.  And so it's an ethical issue of transparency.  Number two, the FTC has ruled that bloggers, for example, that do not reveal not just getting paid, but getting freebies for things could be liable for for not revealing, not being transparent about influence on them.  And number three, using your likeness in an advertising context is way no, no, no, without your permission.  Right. And I've seen magazines that got in this trouble where they used some celebrities photo from the magazine in an ad as if the celebrity were then endorsing the magazine and they get zapped by the FTC and they get sued in court.  And I happen to find in a certain, oh, I don't know, book here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like Public Parts by Jeff Jarvis on page 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a 1902 case involving young Abigail Roberson's likeness on flower barrels were pasted there without her consent.  And the New York Court of Appeals declared at the time there is no present there is at present no right of privacy known in the law.  Wow. This was a key moment here where they used her likeness in a commercial context and she had no right.  The judge said that.  Hold on here.  The so-called right of privacy, as the phrase suggests, founded upon the claim that a man has a right to pass through this world if he wills without having his picture published, his business enterprise discussed his successful experiments written up for the benefit of those or his eccentricities commented upon in either hand bills, circulars, catalogs, periodicals or newspapers.  And he said you couldn't stop all this because then you have to stop newspapers.  That was the beginning of of of of those part of the beginning of a discussion of right of privacy.  And what evolved out of that was the idea that you can't have your likeness presented as if you endorse without your specific approval.  And that's not Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Get away with this because Facebook's doing it and has been for some time.  Well, I guess I'm sure that agreement was Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me, Danny.  That's part of your agreement with Facebook because it's somewhere to be buried in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I did explicitly say they could.  Well, you know, you know, somewhere you didn't say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's opt out features under part of why you saw Instagram doing this, too, because, you know, the other thing that happened is in as Facebook and Instagram, they're blending their privacy policy together.  Facebook can do these things off of just the Facebook book platform.  So this is an extension of what they're already doing.  By the way, this is a similar thing that happens on Google.  I mean, if you have a Google Plus page and someone likes that Google Plus page and then you run AdWords for that Google Plus page, then potentially the people who like that Google Plus page will show up in your AdWords and even little maybe little thumbnails of their pictures might appear in some cases.  So and I presume that at some place we agreed to that as well.  And that all comes back to the whole adage that everybody keeps repeating again.  That is, if you don't know what the product is, you are it.  Or if you're not paying for the product, then you are the product that we don't pay for these services.  Jeff, Jeff, power, Zach, Greg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Rode a great Derek.  I'm sorry, Derek, how is it?  Great rebuttal to that.  But before we do that, I do want to make sure that people are up to date because less than a day ago, Kevin Systrom responded on the Instagram blog.  This is very much the Facebook M.O., by the way, exactly what Facebook's done time and time again, invaded privacy, then backed off.  He said, we're listening.  Thank you.  We're going to modify specific parts of the term to make it more clear what will happen with your photos.  He says, look, advertising is one of many ways Instagram can become a self-sustaining business.  Our intention in updating the terms is to communicate that we'd like to experiment with advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram.  It was interpreted by many we were going to sell your photos to others.  See, I think that is a red herring.  I don't think that that was the issue.  I don't know why CNET focused on that because that's not my takeaway wasn't that.  This is not true.  Of course not.  And it's our mistake that the language is confusing is not our intention to sell your photos.  OK, what is your intention?  We envision a future where both users and brands alike may promote their photos and accounts to increase engagement and build a more meaningful following.  Essentially, he's kind of saying we sponsored posts.  It would be helpful to see which of the people you follow also follow this business.  In some ways, some of the data you produce, like the actions you take following an account and your profile photo might show up if you're following this business.  So Leo Laporte follows XYZ porn star.  You might want to too kind of thing.  The language you proposed also raised questions about whether your photos can be part of an advertisement.  Now, this is interesting.  We do not have plans for anything like this.  So we're going to remove the language that raised the question.  They implied that they did by saying we reserve the right to do that.  But they said, no, we don't want to do that anyway.  We don't assert ownership.  I didn't think they did.  You can set your photos to private and then Instagram only shares photos of the people you've approved to follow you.  So it's a Twitter model where normally on Instagram, everything's public unless you explicitly say, no, no, I don't want my stream to be public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But why?  Why did they go through this needless kerfuffle?  Because it's the Facebook way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Push as hard forward as you can unless and if somebody pushes back, you go, oh, well, we didn't mean that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if they don't, then yeah, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo, I think I think it's more the case.  There's a substantive difference here.  If you put out newsfeed as an entirely new feature and people say, well, I don't know, it's new.  I don't like it.  And Mark says, OK, maybe just communicate.  But trust me, this is something new.  This is going to be good.  This is important.  That's different from a legal document.  They didn't Instagram didn't change any features, didn't add anything of value to anybody.  All it did was lawyers put out a document and you could have shown this document to 10 average users and they all would have said, are you knocking futz?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although, again, Neil I.  Patel says, you know, it was worse because the language was he said this before many times about terms of service.  We get upset when they get more specific.  But he said, really, it's worse to have a very vague T.O.S.  That's literally true because that gives them all the permission to do everything they want.  So he says this is much, much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to kind of rebut that, it's it's when they're vague, that often I think reflects that they don't have specific plans.  And when they get specific, then they have specific things that they want to do.  And that's when I think sometimes and any time you go through one of these things, it's also a time when people will go through and finally pay attention to maybe we should revisit this.  So I don't know that's necessarily the case that well, they had all these huge rights before, but now they got specific.  So it's better.  What's better is that you actually understand what they can and can't do.  Specific doesn't mean you have to like it.  Right.  I mean, it's specific would be a lot better.  I think that's part of the issue that Google had when they made their changes earlier this year was that they really kind of gave themselves a lot of broad abilities, even though they didn't have any intentions to do it.  And it would be nicer perhaps if alongside these these legalistic documents that we get in these privacy things that we get is that we also get a bill of rights.  What are you not going to do?  Right.  You know, people people looked at the Google thing and they assumed, well, now they're going to sell our search data to all these different people because they do it.  And Google would say, well, no, we're not going to do that.  It's like, well, how do I know you're not going to do that?  You haven't itemized it anywhere.  So list the things that you absolutely will not do with with our data and then we'll know.  And, you know, and that may be more useful to us, you know, as well as if you want to itemize the stuff that you are doing, that would certainly be helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will give them credit for saying, look, this only applies to pictures you post after these come into these terms of service come into play January 16th.  So, you know, if you're if you've been using Instagram, you don't have to delete all your photos because those are not in play.  Except that they are, if you believe in Eli, because they were under the old terms of service and they still can do anything they want with them.  But they essentially said, we're only thinking of doing this from January 16th on to pictures you post from that point on.  My response was whether or not they roll back.  They've indicated what they want to do.  And I just don't want to play.  I would I don't want to be part of Facebook either, but you kind of have to.  You don't have to be part of Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, a lot of large brands do these days, you know, that they understand that things are being shared there.  And, you know, and in fact, Instagram is just finally getting to the point where they're this is the whole in our take on marketing.  And part of the thing was, you know, our angle was have they already have they already killed it before they get the marketers get a chance to actually do the things they want to do on this network that they do in other places.  So, you know, they seem to be trying to figure out how do we start paying for that seven hundred and fifty million dollars that we actually cost Facebook or whatever it was in the end.  And but yeah, you're going to have major brands on there that are wanting to share stuff and they're not going to be able to get off.  I still got to be there because chances are there's still going to be a big, huge audience that have to be out there.  So so maybe you'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. I mean, that's why I left Facebook and why I had to come back.  And it might be the same for it certainly would be for the Twitter.  The good news is, as I mentioned at the beginning, Flickr has a great app that has a lot of the same features.  I paid right paid up my Flickr Pro.  So I know they're making money on me.  I presume that means they're less likely to try to do this kind of stuff.  Right, Jean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you explicitly set the terms under which your photos can be used on Twitter on Flickr with the Creative Commons licensing model that they had.  They've had forever.  Flickr is this like this very old school web app that just got really dusty for a while and now is sort of seeing seeing a comeback.  My co-founder, Anil, he mentioned earlier he did a he did a great post this week called The Web We Lost.  Yeah, I love this. Very good post.  It was a really great piece just about the way the things that people valued when they made web applications 10 years ago versus today like data export and import and Creative Commons licensing and openness and collaboration.  Now we have Twitter cutting off access to the social graph and Twitter, you know, Instagram disabling Twitter cards.  I mean, it's like these companies are active and we'll talk about Google ActiveSync or Exchange later.  It's like companies are now cutting off access to one another.  But Flickr was kind of that one of those old school like license your photos openly versus copyright them versus limit it.  And it's just, you know, it stores multiple copies of your your high resolution photo versus applying a filter and cropping it.  You know, it's just a really different kind of time.  I'm happy to be back.  I've been using Flickr ever since my daughter was born because I just I really like the way that the app works.  And I like that, you know, Flickr's values.  And so I'm thrilled that all my friends are getting getting back onto it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Although, you know, add something.  I did this story and it was in 2009.  It was called Flickr's big fail and Creative Commons attribution.  And a lot of people will say, well, you know, Flickr is great because you can set your your limitations and you can create a comment or whatever.  But the Creative Commons stuff is woefully inadequate in a lot of ways.  When you go through, it'll say things like I license this only for noncommercial use and you have to attribute it.  But there's still I mean, I just looked at this a few months ago on Flickr.  There's still no way to say the exact kind of attribution that you want.  There's no kind of contact details that come along with it.  So, you know, do I if I take a photo off of Flickr, if I just say the Flickr person's name, was that attribution enough in the way that they wanted or was a link required?  Do they have to link back to Flickr?  There there could be good improvements.  And one thing I'd hope that Flickr would take away from this is actually revisit some of those attributions and make sure that people can better specify what's involved with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because of course, they didn't create it.  Creative Commons is a separate organization.  But I think those are good ideas.  The Creative Commons, I don't know who the board is now.  Joy Edo has been on it for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if it's Creative Commons problem, though.  I think Flickr just needs one more field that says and that attribution.  How would you like that to be?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because right now when you when you click on them, you'll you go to Flickr, you click on these things and it takes you to like a Creative Commons page that says like, you know, you must attribute the work a manner specified by the author and license or.  And then but when you post pictures to Flickr, you don't necessarily say it.  And I think a bigger issue all this is just how the photo sharing services in general have still not evolved.  You get these photos that are shared all over the place and, you know, the mainstream media will just consider it to be a help yourself type of thing.  If they see the pictures out there and then they grab it, some of them try to get in contact with people.  Some people have no idea how you get in contact with someone to use a photo.  So it still feels like when it comes to photos, especially when there's breaking news photos that people are sharing out there, that it's like the Wild West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where the idea of selling photos actually is a good idea.  If Instagram said we will act as your agent.  Right. And if a news organization comes to us once by your photo, we will communicate that to you and will act like a PayPal for you and will help you sell your photos if you want to.  Or you can say you can state that on there.  That would have been pretty cool.  Flickr should do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big opportunity for Flickr here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Twitter as well, because Twitter takes and they host all their own photos as well.  And people are doing that.  I agree. That would be an ideal thing where people say, hey, this is great.  I'm not going to go out there and try to license my own photo.  And if you can do that for all these organizations, then great.  Sign me up.  Or if you really are concerned about it, you say no.  And that's indicated as part of your photos as well.  This is not licensed for greater use unless you get in contact in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is the backlash against Instagram overblown?  Here's National Geographic's response.  They have almost 650,000 followers on Instagram.  We've got 40,000 likes on this.  It says this is an Instagram photo.  Nat Geo is suspending new post to Instagram.  We're very concerned with the direction of the proposed new terms of service.  If they remain as presented, we may close our account.  And that was the big one, right?  That was the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That certainly helped me realize National Geographic was on Instagram.  You know, I didn't know they were either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I won't bother following them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, for pulling your photos off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, notice they said we're suspending posting and we may close our account if these terms go into effect.  See, this is the thing.  I think that everyone had this knee-jerk reaction and deleted their account.  And then Instagram said, oh, actually, we screwed up and we're going to we're going to revise this language.  And I saw somebody tweet like, oh, who wrote the tool where I can reimport my photos back into Instagram?  It was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction.  But you know, this is what I was talking about in the op-ed I did for the Times that we talked about last week.  This is this isn't working.  This is the community working.  Right.  So like Instagram puts out those terms and says this is going to go into effect in 30 days.  The community criticizes it, forces them to clarify, forces them to say, actually, you know what?  We never really meant to do that.  So we shouldn't include that language.  And they're revising it.  I mean, this is this is how things iterate.  So I I didn't delete my account.  I've always sort of double posted from Instagram and Flickr like through Instagram.  Instagram always did allow you to post a Flickr at the same time.  Because I wasn't sure if I was actually going to stick with Instagram.  I didn't close my account.  So I think Nat Geo actually did the right thing where they said, you know, we're just going to take a break.  We're going to wait.  We're going to wait.  See if this is actually going to go down the way that it did.  And they got great press.  I mean, they put the pressure on Instagram.  And right now we all know that Nat Geo is on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John Blanton has a good point in our chat room, though.  If there wasn't this strong reaction, maybe Instagram would have not rethought.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the so it had the effect intended.  We'll see what their response is.  Getting to Derek Pawasek's post on his blog, Pawasek.com.  He actually this is actually good.  I'm glad you know, I've used this phrase to came from I think it came from a Reddit post.  If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.  The implication being that maybe you're paying for Flickr so you don't have to worry so much.  But if you're getting Facebook and Instagram and Google for free, then maybe they're selling you to somebody else.  His point is, you know, that's not necessarily true.  First of all, there's a couple of false assumptions.  In many cases, an example would be this show.  It's a free product, but advertising supported free media is a very popular form of media.  He also says there's some assumption that you pay a company, they're going to treat you better.  There's no evidence of that.  He says, I can answer this with one word, AT&T or Comcast or Wells Fargo.  So his point I think is well taken, which is we should stop using that phrase.  It's always been the media model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The audience is sold to the advertiser and that's what supports the free media.  It's not anything new.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's nothing so bad about it, as long as it's an explicit trade.  The thing I don't like, I just don't like the idea that Instagram is going to, you know,  wanted to start using my image.  It's the same thing Facebook, it's exactly the same thing Facebook was doing.  Of course.  We're going to take a break.  We will have more.  Instagram is done.  You can now take your iPad out of the sand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can take off the filter off this screen now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because I know a lot already, it doesn't take long in this news cycle, 24 hours into this,  people in the chat are saying, I don't want to hear any more about it.  I'm done with it.  Nice filter though.  I like that.  The new, this is the new Willow filter from Instagram.  Andy Sullivan is here.  Searchengineland.com.  Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com and Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.  Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.  See, this is an ad.  This portion is an ad.  This is me doing an advertisement.  You mean they pay you for this?  I get paid and the money that we receive for doing this ad pays for all that you see here,  which is believe me, not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I feel like the product.  You are the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, Danny Sullivan is the product.  You know, it's challenging.  When I started the Twitter, I thought, well, maybe we could do this user supported  because I'd love to just have a direct correlation.  But as many have realized, especially when you're talking about media,  people are used to free media, ad supported media.  They're not going to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, thank you stamps.com.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you.  And we're picky.  We don't, we have a handful of advertisers.  They're selected carefully.  We don't let just anybody advertise.  We've refuged quite a few advertisers in fact.  Because we want to have a nice correlation between the audience and the advertisers.  Stamps.com is a good example.  This is a service.  Now, the other thing that we do is it's just very straightforward.  We tell you what the service is.  We give you a free trial.  If you want it, you got it.  If not, you don't have to do anything about it.  The only negative is I'm going to take a little bit of your time talking about it.  That's all.  And you can fast forward through this if you want.  On the other hand, if you do a lot of mailing, you might want to listen because stamps.  Oh, I left my scale in my office.  The new scale is here with stamps.com.  So what is stamps.com?  It's the pro way to mail so you never have to go to the post office.  It means that you can do everything you do at the post office right from your desk,  which means buy and print U.S. postage.  No postage meter now, by the way.  I don't know what the people who do postage meters are going to do about this.  You just use your computer and your printer.  You already got everything.  You need no special ink or anything.  You can also, the mail carrier will come and get the mail.  So you put it on the, you can print right on the envelope.  So if you're doing invoices or mailers or anything like that,  print right on the envelope, return address.  The address is taken from your address book or QuickBooks if you use that.  Your logo, company logo, all this printed automatically by stamps.com.  Even the postage, legal postage, right on the envelope.  It actually looks more professional than having a stamp on the envelope.  It looks like you'd do this for a living.  If you're on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, if you sell stuff online,  all the fulfillment can be handled by stamps.com.  They take the address from the website.  They fill out all the forms if necessary.  If you're sending express or priority mail,  they can send an email to your recipient saying it's on its way.  Here's the tracking number.  And they've got this great USB scale.  You plug this into the computer.  You plop the envelope or the package up to 25 pounds on here.  And the software does the rest.  It says, yeah, got it.  Now, I'm going to show you how you can get this scale for free  and a trial of stamps.com, a no-risk trial offer.  This is why I like our advertisers.  They almost, I think to a man and a woman, they all offer free trials.  $80 bonus, wait a minute, no, click that microphone.  Enter the word twig.  Is that a word? Yeah, twig.  And now the $80 offer is a $110 bonus offer that includes the scale.  You pay shipping and handling for that. It's about five bucks.  You get the supply kit worth five bucks to make up for that.  You get $55 in free postage that you can use over a few months' time  at a four-week trial.  It's all from stamps.com.  This is a great way, especially in the month of December,  which is amateur hour at the post office.  Stay out of the post office.  Get your mail-in done like a pro with stamps.com.  And yes, we thank them for their support of the show, making this possible.  You mentioned, this is an interesting story,  that Google is turning off Microsoft's ActiveSync Exchange,  which means if you use Windows Phone, Google is not a good choice for you.  Is that what it means, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what it means.  Yeah, so ActiveSync is, and actually I use the Exchange Sync on my iPhone as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, but that's okay. Exchange Sync will still work.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  IMAP works.  IMAP works.  Well, so there's IMAP in CardDAV and CalDAV, right?  But then there's Exchange Sync.  And that's what the iPhone uses.  Right, that's what the iPhone uses.  So this means that basically Gmail users won't be able to sync their Google calendar contacts  and email to Windows Phones using the Windows Phone email app.  Does that sound right?  Yes.  Did I get that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's going to stop working on January 30th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft could do what Apple did and support IMAP.  That works with Gmail.  CalDAV works with Calendar.  And CardDAV.  CardDAV works with Contacts.  Google also has said earlier that they're not going to make a Gmail app for Windows Phone  and has no plans to make Windows apps for any of its apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, IMAP will still work on Windows Phone though, won't it?  I mean, when I set up Windows Phone with Mail, it was an IMAP account, I'm pretty sure.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, IMAP will work.  This is for email, calendar, and contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I don't think you have that option on a Windows Phone.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, is Alex there?  And I don't have mine upstairs, so I can't look right now.  Is Alex there?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The email client on Windows Phone doesn't support IMAP?  IMAP is like...  That can't be right.  IMAP is the standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't be right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I mean, I'm pretty sure it will still...  So I think the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really calendar and contacts you're at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the problem is, Windows Phone, I'm pretty sure, will support any IMAP account.  Because you can have an other email account and you go through and you do all the settings,  you have to do it manually.  And in fact, Windows Phone has been pretty awesome in the fact that I can give it a Google  Apps, which is a Gmail account that you actually have in your own domain.  I can give it that account.  It is actually always set up the IMAP settings better than an Android phone will do.  Android goes, I don't know what this is all about.  It's a Google Apps account.  I can't handle it.  And Windows Phone goes, oh yeah, I know what it is.  Your security, it's SSL.  It does it all.  So I think it'll set it up.  But I think the difference is that it's not going to automatically push email to you in  the way that I guess ExchangeSync will do it.  So you'd have to have your phone itself constantly checking.  Which I mean, I just check manually anyway because I like to get my battery going.  So it's not been an issue for me.  And so I'm pretty sure you can still get your email through Windows Phone using the IMAP  protocol.  And that's not a problem.  But the calendar, I know, has been absolutely awesome in that my Windows Phone will go through  and sync with my calendar and everything.  And I don't know how it's doing.  It just knows that I have a Google account.  And it's been talking to the Google account.  And it sounds like the calendar as well as the contacts are about to go poof.  And you're going to be out of luck on that.  Unless Microsoft changes to another format on their end, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have a whole bunch of apps that are like Internet Explorer hasn't been on the  Apple for two or three years now.  You can't get Skype on Chrome, which means they don't Chromebook.  And you now can't get Gmail natively on Windows Phone.  It's this little game that goes on.  It's a yeah, yeah, yeah, you on Windows, you on this, you on the competitor.  I just don't think it.  You know, look at the experience, which we'll talk about in a few minutes, I'm sure, with  Google and Maps on the iPhone.  At some point, isn't it still in your benefit to serve customers no matter what they're  using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what is it?  In fact, this is where Google gets, I think, very hypocritical and some of this stuff.  And let me say, I don't know enough technically on whether or not Google is using a common  standard that would be easy for Microsoft to support or not when it comes to contacts  and calendars.  I can't tell on that.  But when you say things like, well, Google doesn't want to write a Gmail app for Windows  Phone because a Gmail app is not required to get your mail from Gmail.  In fact, I hate the Gmail app on the iPhone and on Android because I prefer to have my  messages be discrete and I prefer email clients that actually loop them into a conversation  but show them as discrete individual messages in that conversation.  Which Windows Phone will support?  An iPhone's native client will do it.  And on Android, it is all over the place as to whether or not any of the email clients  will do it.  But Google's not actually written a Gmail client for Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody just said, MXX just said you can get Gmail natively on Windows Phone.  I don't know.  So I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An Android phone has an email client and then you can also get a Gmail client.  Gmail client is designed to work with Gmail and give you a more Gmail-like experience.  But Gmail itself is just an email service.  So any email client can interact with that service.  Here's Microsoft's response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is maybe what confused me.  Really want to do some winter cleaning?  Switch to Outlook.com for the best email experience across all your devices.  We are very surprised to see Gmail announced last week.  They'll soon end support for EAS unless, of course, you're willing to pay Google for your email.  It will still work on the app's platform.  It means that many people currently using Gmail for free are facing a situation where  they might have to degrade their mobile email experience by downgrading to an older protocol.  Okay, I guess that's IMAP that doesn't sync your calendar contacts,  doesn't give you direct push of new email messages, and doesn't have all the benefits of EAS.  So they're saying just use Outlook.com and a web browser on your phone and then you'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I set up my iPhone, I use an exchange account to set up my Gmail to sync contacts and calendar  because that was the sort of best way that people in the know kind of knew to sync contacts and calendar and email.  Actually, I didn't sync email because I just use the Gmail client.  So what they want you to do is forward your Gmail to Outlook.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and then use Microsoft's Outlook.com on your mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that doesn't solve the calendar contacts issue.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's part of the problem with Outlook.  Outlook.com can mock the idea that IMAP is an older protocol, but it's actually a newer protocol than POP,  which Outlook supports. It doesn't support IMAP, which is insane.  One of the number one reasons I wouldn't use Outlook is because I don't have IMAP support.  If you have IMAP support, then you have the ability to sync your mail.  The big advantage to IMAP is that you're reading your email on your iPhone and you delete or archive a message.  And then you go to your desktop and your desktop knows exactly what happened on your other phone.  They're syncing and they know your exact status.  And I'm juggling four different phones sometimes and I've got two or three different computers and IMAP makes it all happen.  But I couldn't do that on Outlook unless I used EAS, I guess, which I've never even bothered with because IMAP has been fine.  The calendar and the context stuff is a big problem. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So who's bad here? Google or Microsoft? Seems like Google's the one turning the capability off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to say because I don't know enough about Exchange ActiveSync and how common that is or not common.  I would probably put more of the bad part on Google because why are you changing something that was probably already working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It seems spiteful. Seems a little spiteful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it will continue to work for paying customers.  So Google is making the bet that people who are using Windows Phone have the money in the corporate organization that will pay for Google Apps.  So it does feel a little bit like the Google Apps free accounts going away.  It's like, oh, you hooked a lot of people with the free offering for a certain amount of time and now saying, hey, you got to pay for this.  So slightly troubling to me. Like, OK, this is becoming a pay for service now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you also have to put that in the context of other things that Google's done.  So I spend a lot of time like with Google Voice and actually trying to get Google to explain to me why I can't get a Google Voice app for Windows Phone.  Because since I use Google Voice as my primary number, not having a Google Voice account on Windows Phone is a problem for me because I can't dial out for my own number.  And worse, if I want to still use the Google Voice account in some way, there's no web based interface that's functional.  I actually have to go to a third party app and I have to trust a third party app with not just my Google Voice account information, but my entire Google account information.  So this is a security issue. And there are significant numbers of people who use Windows Phone and Windows devices.  It's not anywhere near Android, not anywhere near iOS, but there are still significant numbers of people.  So it's like, why are you first of all, why are you producing a potential security issue for people by not supporting this?  Because it is probably not hard for you to come up with something.  But secondly, aren't you the same company that threw a hissy fit when you couldn't get Google Voice approved for iOS?  And you threw that hissy fit. You wanted the audience over at iOS, but you didn't say it like, oh, we wish we were on iOS because there's a significant audience there that we want to reach.  You make it all sound like it was just a fairness and it's equality and it's rights and access and everything else.  And when that's not really the case, the case is we want to be on iOS because a lot of our audience is there and we think we need to be involved with it.  But we don't give a toss about Windows Phone, especially in terms of even possibly helping it emerge as a competitor, because there's not that many people there, so it won't bother.  But when it came to rolling out Windows 8 and Windows 8 made some significant changes on how your search default changes and how you get to have a search default provider,  suddenly it's like we cannot at Google get a search app out fast enough to make sure that you can keep getting Google the way you want to have Google.  Because in that case, the Windows system is big enough that they actually care about it.  They didn't do anything like, well, gosh, you know, we can't support everybody and we don't know what we're going to do.  And goodness knows people could just find us directly by going to Google.  So, yeah, I found it disappointing more on Google's part than Microsoft's part. I wish they had taken the high road and continued to support it.  But then I've also been an Outlook user on Windows. When I shifted over to Outlook on the Mac, it's like nothing works over there.  Can't do stuff with Google. You can sync your email, but you want your calendar to talk.  You want your calendar on your Mac to talk to your iCloud calendar? Forget it.  You want your calendar to talk to Google? Forget it.  And whether it's Apple or Microsoft or Google or none of them all talking, it's just been a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It seems like there's no technical reason, obviously, why they couldn't continue to support it.  And certainly there can't be a cost reason.  But perhaps could you say the reason is they didn't want to support a proprietary protocol and prefer to support open protocols like CalDAV and CardDAV.  These are open protocols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they clean a whole bunch of stuff out of their calendar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're saying we're not going to support a protocol by one company for one company.  Why doesn't Microsoft use IMAP, CalDAV and CardDAV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right. But unless you pay us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unless you pay us. And that's a little weird. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're still supporting it. It'd be one thing if they were like, well, you know.  But if you pay us, yeah.  It's a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And somebody's telling me existing devices will work, only new devices won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that wording was interesting. So yeah, it said for new devices.  So if I've got Exchange Sync set up on my device, then it's going to on a free account, then it's going to continue to work.  So we're checking the device ID, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It's a hissy fit.  You've convinced me.  It's them going up yours, Microsoft.  It's their payback for Scroogle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and not just Scroogle, but now it's getting worse and worse.  There's some other stuff on here. You have they hired.  Oh, what's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hired gun to go after.  Microsoft hired a political operative to go after Google.  Oh, yeah. The Mark Penn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you, Mark Penn.  Wasn't that interesting? Mark Penn's the guy who did all that research for Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The New York Times today has an op-ed. It's a very strange thing to me.  It's an op-ed that is clearly placed by Microsoft.  That's the disclosure at the end, which is just its PR move against Google.  It's an op-ed with major play.  So Microsoft's on a major.  So now Apple is seeming to calm down.  And now Microsoft is deciding that it's going to get louder.  And it's it is long standing on the fight against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Mark Penn was the was the negative ad pollster for Bill Clinton.  And so you when when you hire when you hire that guy, he was at Burst and Marsteller, the PR firm.  When you hire that guy to go after Google, you're you know what you're going to get.  You know what? I can't wait.  Scroogling is just begun. Get ready for more.  Won't be coming from the FTC, though.  They say Google did not violate any trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They haven't said it out loud yet, but the reports are that they don't have a case against Google.  They're trying to say in somewhat in sync with the EU.  The EU is still pushing it.  But basically, it's what I've been saying all along.  There's not a good antitrust case here.  And I think that they just legally don't have it.  And that's what's happening.  So they would love to file a case, but they just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're sure there's a trust in there somewhere.  Big. So they must be bad and evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The search bias claims.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the EU could still go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could use trying, but it's having similar problems.  And the DOJ is investigating, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Department of Justice, the US Department of Justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't think they're going to, you know, we'll see.  I don't think they're going to get anywhere.  The FTC just announced its new COPPA a few minutes ago.  Its new COPPA privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Child Online Protection and Privacy Act.  And are they the enforcers thereof?  They are. They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as we talked about the show before, there's nothing really terribly new there  versus what we've had.  But now the things that were in discussion and in hearings and such are formally announced.  And they're much tougher.  They're going to have a big impact on some sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're going to cover apps with COPPA, but they are accepting  Apple's App Store and Google Play because they're not apps.  They're platforms.  Both Apple and Google lobbied the FTC hard, saying,  we can't be held responsible for what these apps do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So all these kids games are going to say, hey, kids, you like tapping this button.  You agree that you've told your parents about all your information that we're sucking in.  And kids are tapping yes.  And I just want to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope, Gina, that won't be the way it works.  In fact, what has to happen is the parent has to give explicit permission for the app to do these things.  And the permission used to be able to come from email.  That's no more.  The parent has to do one of a few things.  Last I knew in the draft.  One was print out, sign and scan a document, print this out, a document or have a video conference with the company.  Wow, that's a little.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a kid's game in the app store, say the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it wants to use any personal personal information, which is to say, for example, as far as I know it,  Gee, this is a geography game, kids.  Where do you live?  And we'll tell you how big Texas is over your house.  Or or if it's I would imagine if it wants to hold your winning accounts under some thing like your name or to get your email address to send you something,  you know, any of those things where it's PII, personal information, then the parent must give explicit permission in those ways.  I just outlawed.  Well, the center is the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Leo.  Is the device ID considered PII?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  US in the EU, there is talk about an IP address being considered personally identifiable information, which is insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But yeah, there's a the Center for Digital Democracy has written a letter to the FTC saying, hey, you got to investigate this Spongebob Diner Dash game.  This is from Nickelodeon.  It's a freemium app, so it's free on the iPhone and iPad.  It's in the kids game section.  It's got Spongebob.  You know, if you have kids, Spongebob Squarepants is very, very, very popular.  The idea is for children to help Spongebob seat serve and satisfy all kinds of fishy customers in five colorful bikini bottom restaurants run by the selfish Mr.  Crab.  It asks men kids have to buy virtual coins to buy shoes that make Spongebob faster or a frying pan that makes the cook faster.  But the kids are asked for all sorts of stuff, including full name, email address, another contact information without providing notice to parents or obtaining prior parental consent.  They're going to get zapped bad.  Yeah.  And it's Nickelodeon.  The filing asks the FTC to investigate the app's data collection and privacy notice practices, including its use of mobile marketing techniques such as you did and device tokens.  To your question, Gina, which enabled companies to send custom messages to individual children in the form of push notifications.  So, yeah, under COPPA, those are considered personal information.  Oh, OK.  This according to the Center for Digital Democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are other clauses that relate specifically to targeting children and advertising.  Yeah.  So if you know, it's a child, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Well, and obviously no adults playing Spongebob Squarepants.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's a fun game.  I play the grownup version of Diner Dash.  There is another version just for you grownups.  We'll see what happens. Google, did they pay a Belgian?  No, they didn't pay.  OK, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the dear the French Belgian papers have for some time been trying to go after Google News and they pulled out of Google News and they went back.  And then there's all kinds of back and forth.  And now there's an agreed upon not a settlement, I wouldn't call it, but a resolution.  And as I understand it, Google, there's no no explicit mention of Google paying royalties for the privilege of quoting and linking to their news stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google says we are collaborating with them to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google is going to take out ads for its own Google services in those publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wink, wink. And yeah, we used to do that in cable television.  You'd go when you want to get to tech TV on a cable operator.  Let's say you want to get on in beautiful New York City.  So you go to cable vision and you have this little black bag that has money in it.  And you say, we would like to give you some marketing co-op dollars.  Which means here's some money. This will help you market our new channel.  Here's the here's a million dollars. Do whatever you want.  But that's it's the same deal. We're going to buy ads in Le Monde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google is going to buy ads and well, that's from France.  This is a Belgian. It's going to buy ads and publications.  It's going to put ads on these publications and help them make money, which is fine.  They always could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Two to three percent of sales around five million euros, according to Le Monde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this goes right to the shall we say it?  Shall we cue it? The Leistungsschutzrecht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, man. So what is the deal? Why is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why is this the same? What is Le... Say again, just remind us what Leistungsschutzrecht is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leistungsschutzrecht is an ancillary copyright that would demand Google to pay straight out.  Basically a fee for the privilege of quoting the headlines and snippets and linking to news articles.  Google refused to do that because imagine what would happen.  Imagine the precedent set if suddenly everyone on earth said you can't link to me and give me, by the way, great benefit and value.  If you don't pay me, A, B, the impact on in this country, fair use is devastating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leistungsschutzrecht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leistungsschutzrecht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wasn't listening to anything you said, Jeff. I was busy finding this YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just blathered it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just in between reggae hits.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is it 420?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it is a way. Yeah, it's 420. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not on the West Coast. Not on the West Coast yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, look, buying ads is giving them money. Yeah, we're going to buy some ads from you.  So that's giving them money. They got robbed into it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's done this before. Google's done this mainly with the wire services where they have had disputes with the AP or AFP.  And then they've gone back and forth. And then in the end they've said, we're not going to license things.  We all agree about that, although we are going to do an agreement to work on things that would go beyond fair use and will help us better.  Like with the AP, they're like, help us better understand when we have duplicate content and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And in the end, it actually just might as well have been a license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google actually did license AP content, Denny. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not for the reasons that AP was upset about. Google specifically said we are licensing content to go beyond the stuff that is fair use.  They were really, really careful to say we're not licensing AP because there was some fair use violation.  But we want to do things that go beyond fair use. Therefore, OK, what kind of deal?  And that shut AP up. AP has been quiet for a very long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The irony is it hurt the newspapers because a lot of those links that would go to AP stories used to go to random newspaper sites where the AP story was run.  And now instead they go to AP stories on Google dot com.  So so the AP hurt its own members. But that's the way it works.  This is getting awfully inside baseball for most of the world.  But I'm having dinner tonight with executives from Agence France Presse.  So I'll abuse them about this. You know, it's Google could play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have a strong hand. They could have just said, yeah, fine.  You don't want. I mean, that's what they've done in the past. You know, well, Google still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the Belgian case was still, if I remember correctly, going to an appellate course court.  And, you know, Google had won some things here, but not won some other things there.  So it was still being appealed. And, you know, this is a cheap way to get the whole thing settled and shut it up at the same time when you're actually looking, as Jeff says, at a far bigger issue, which is, wow, people in France and Germany seem to want to be doing what people in the US were doing two years ago.  And they finally gave up on it. It's like kind of watching a time warp going on here where the French and German newspapers seem to think that, oh, well, I guess you can just pay us some money now because the US papers, especially being led by the Wall Street Journal or the News Corp, kind of gave up on that as their ad prospects started coming back up.  And they were like, oh, yeah, those pages, those are important to us. Actually, we're still making quite a bit of money off of that. So that's fine.  Let's let's leave that stuff running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I didn't mention this, but this might have something to do with the scrupling of Microsoft's and the Exchange server.  And I was just with Pamela Jones Harbor, who is a, according to the New York Times member, former member of the FTC, now a lawyer at Fulbright and Jaworski where she represents Microsoft, wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times on the 18th, which was yesterday, slamming Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was just a straight out PR shot.  Wow.  I found it really odd that the New York Times would give it this kind of play.  And, you know, it has the disclosure at the end that that she works for Microsoft.  But all it is is the company line against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She says that settling with the FTC would be a severe setback for Internet users that allow Google to continue to amass unbridled control over data gathering with grave consequences for privacy for consumer choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except that the FTC isn't investigating anything about that in terms of antitrust.  The FTC investigation is whether or not Google has been anti-competitive in some very specific areas.  None of those have been related to consumer protection or gathering too much data.  So, yeah, this feels very much like a, gosh, the FTC is about to settle with Google and not in the way that Microsoft and Microsoft's group of people that have decided that Google has been anti-competitive to them in search want.  So what else can we do to slow it down?  And they seem to be successful because there were a lot of accounts that we were going to get an FTC ruling this week.  And now it looks like we're not going to have that until, you know, after the New Year.  So they may have stalled the FTC saying, find your good Google and we'll probably have a bit more debate on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She writes when she was at the FTC, she dissented on the commission's approval of the Google's acquisition of DoubleClick because she was concerned that combining the two companies would allow Google largely unchecked by competition to develop invasive profiles of individuals' Internet habits.  But doesn't, I mean, I think there's a risky strategy for Microsoft to pursue because I'm sure they're doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing about both.  Go ahead, David.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like I was concerned that Google's combining those things.  I was concerned that both the two companies combining unchecked by competition would let them have invasive profiles of Internet habits.  But if only another big company were to compile as an invasive database, that would protect consumers.  They're not. She's like, it's like, oh, by the way, shoving the word competition in there somewhere, because I got to get back to the fact that we're really actually more upset that Google may be not being stalled on competitive fronts rather than being a consumer protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Consumer protection and competition have nothing to do with one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And but the other this is where I think both Microsoft and News Corp are similar because they would be going too far to say they've given up on advertising.  But advertising is not the core to their business that it certainly is to Google and much of media.  And News Corp is going after fees.  Microsoft is going after fees and licensing.  And neither has proven these days to be good at online digital advertising.  So they're going after the core of their competitors business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, as an FTC commissioner, should we be concerned that the first thing you do after not being an FTC commissioner is to go off and represent people who then want to argue stuff in front of the FTC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting dizzy in that revolving door, eh, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She writes, I'm no longer an FTC commissioner, but a lawyer representing companies, including Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that makes her a sterling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That are concerned about Google's power as a data collector.  Yes, there's some irony in that.  It wasn't long ago that Microsoft faced its own major antitrust lawsuit and had to change its anti-competitive practices.  We're now clean and wholesome.  I'm surprised.  I guess, though, the op-ed page has never been a place for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I had an episode happen recently.  I wrote a blog post about this, the tax fight that Google and also Starbucks and Amazon are in the UK, where I said that taxes are a legal obligation, not a moral choice.  And to make Google and these other companies try to choose to pay more is ridiculous in all kinds of ways.  So I wrote this blog post and then Google came to me and said, well, the Guardian is looking for somebody to write an op-ed on this topic.  You want to write it?  You want to write it?  That's what I'd write.  And so they went back to the Guardian.  It never happened.  But that was so weird to me that, you know, here's a newspaper negotiating with a company saying kind of basically saying, well, we have been very nice to you so you can get somebody to write something that says what you want to say.  And Google is going to write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to go the other way, too.  I mean, you know, give it a week, give it two weeks.  Larry Page will have an op-ed.  Or Page will be in there with like, hey, Google, we, you know, we're just publishing a search engine and it's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, as I remember, Larry Page did have an op-ed piece in the Times not so long ago.  Sometime ago.  Maybe this is the response to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Microsoft came along and said, not fair.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got somebody who can write something.  I think the op-ed page is notorious for being that way.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I've never been to the op-ed page.  This is me off.  Now, here's where the here's where the competition with a rubber really hits the road.  Know where you're going.  Microsoft has stolen the Santa tracker since 2004.  The Norad Santa tracker was a Google Norad deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not since 2004, since 2007.  I'll get into hacking this whole thing if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Because now Google, Google lost it.  Right. Norad's doing a deal with Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Leo, it starts back in, I don't know, 1974.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember doing this on the radio.  We would get clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were probably telling me on the radio that Santa was coming.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I get clips from Norad that you would drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Lieutenant Commander G. William F. Buckley reporting from Norad's command center near the North Pole.  It looks like the jolly old elf has begun his rounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then you'd play that.  It was cute.  And you'd play it all evening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a good bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's coming.  Yeah.  And it was fun.  It must be true.  And it's a guy in a uniform.  And then it got really, in the internet era, it wasn't as good, frankly.  It changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's better.  Well, I mean, so, you know, Norad, they're the missile tracking people, right?  In 1965, there was an ad that was printed for Sears Roebuck saying, call and find out where Santa is.  And they printed the wrong phone number and people started calling the Norad.  Oh, you're kidding.  That's how it started?  That's how it started.  And so Norad said, all right, yeah, let me just, let's check our radar.  Here he is.  And that's how the tradition got started that they were tracking Santa.  So as you said, you know, and that's how I remember it used to be on the radio.  Yeah.  It was time around 2004.  They seemed to be getting onto the web and they started doing this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And here's what it looks like.  I got a little clip from YouTube of Norad tracking a Santa North American Air Defense Command.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is what's great about it, by the way, because you got 3D animations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Notice the big Google logo in the lower right hand corner.  I mean, it got it.  It got cheesed up.  I don't know.  Are kids more persuaded now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They love it.  The kids, they love it.  The only thing I really hated is as a parent, I wanted to time shift it because you really want the kids to go to bed at like nine.  So it doesn't help that Santa is in the middle of the country.  I want to say, look, he's coming around now.  Google said in their blog.  So since 2007, Google has formally partnered with Norad where it has been Google Maps, Google YouTube, all sorts of things.  And in fact, there were other Santa trackers.  But over the and I track this every year.  Really?  I do.  Every year at Christmas Eve, it's like I'm going to disappear.  I got to here's what's going on with the Santa tracking.  Here's the rundown because it used to be more complicated.  You have all sorts of different things you can do in addition to Norad.  Now I just run through and say, well, here's how Norad's working today.  And, you know, here's where the videos are and here's how you can get it on your phone and so on and so on.  And all these other Santa trackers have disappeared.  Norad has just been this juggernaut that's been out there.  And Google monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want the FTC to investigate Norad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You will maybe because so what?  So they really have been this thing with Google.  And then what happened was normally December 1st, like clockwork, I'm sitting around waiting for Google to do their blog post about, hey, it's Christmas time again and holiday time.  And we're working with Norad.  It never came.  And then it was I think last week that Microsoft posted they were working with Norad.  Google's gone.  Google's out of it.  We don't have the details.  I got a statement from Norad.  This was all I wrote it up on Searching, but I got a statement from Norad and they're saying, yes, we've gone our different ways this year.  And, you know, we're working with Microsoft now and there's no like statement about who's paying what or whatever.  But someone's paying something.  Right. And Google was out.  OK, so you're kind of like a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at this, though, Danny.  So you go if you go to Norad Santa dot org where they have the countdown to track Santa.  But you look down here on the bottom, download the official Norad track Santa Windows 8 app.  Now, they do have a Google and iPhone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They bought Santa Claus.  I think Microsoft said bought Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you they did buy Santa or they bought Santa for more money than Google was paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently you can also get Norad official.  I tracked Santa gear.  Yes, you can.  This is really gotten commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad that Danny has followed this.  Goodness, Danny.  He's a historian.  Yeah, he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right below that Norad tracking Santa.  There's one thing that you're going to still see there, which is YouTube.  And I'll come back to that.  So Google's out.  Ha ha.  Windows wins. Great.  You know, isn't that funny?  Blah, blah, blah. Or isn't it sad?  Because in some ways, Google got really into this whole Norad thing.  So today, Google announces that, oh, yeah, since 2004, we've been tracking Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here, let me turn this down.  It's overpowering.  It's the Norad tracked Santa video.  Sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they say we've been tracking Santa since 2004.  And here we are doing it once again at our new Google tracking center.  There's no mention of Norad.  So really, Google is now taking on the missile defense people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's gotten that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think you track missiles?  We track all the world's information.  We can go toe to toe with you.  And that's exactly what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they created their own Santa tracker page.  Now, this is still Norad's Santa tracker.  This is their promotional video for 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Key difference that will be between these two things.  Google was not going to produce its own video of Santa flying around.  It's only going to show you where they're running around on maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the official Windows 8 app, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not going to produce its own video because the one thing that Norad is continuing to do is to post all that video over to Google on the map.  And then they're going to show you Google owned YouTube.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you see, we can't have Christmas harmony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's double dipping.  For now.  You know, the thing is next year, maybe Google will decide they want to do their own videos as well.  And I anyway, for those of us, me who tracks the tracking tracking, it's gotten vicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Recursive tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How old are your kids now, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's is it now moot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, if anybody's watching this, go away.  Believers in the household.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what I always say?  Those who don't believe in Santa don't get presents from Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Here's the Google Santa tracker, which is frankly a little more HTML5 than the Norad tracker.  And there's and there's more stuff to do.  There's little bouncy activities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to see the drones come in after Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can message and they'll say I got to say, though, I kind of wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a Google Plus link to Santa.  They do.  Oh, Santa is clearly on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can add a Nexus seven to your wish list for Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I bet you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I had saying that you like Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to like I'm going to like Santa right now.  Can I have some clearly the Grinch in the room?  The way the way to edit, wait till Edda says, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, we can track Santa.  Here he comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to videotape it and put it up online.  Yeah, I'm going to crush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to crush all the Santa dreams when they get go.  Really?  I yeah.  What?  What a Grinch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Oh, you are going to get so much spam now.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I read this great post.  I think it was Charlie Park did this post about how like he wanted to be honest with  his kids about Santa.  But he but he also wanted them to enjoy the you know, the story of it and the character  of it.  So he said that he tells his kids that Santa is a game that people play and that you pretend  that Santa's real.  Like the rules of the game is you pretend that Santa's real and you never break character.  But you know, have you told your mother you're going to do this yet?  No, we have not.  She's not going to look at this.  Look at this.  Get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can chat with welcome every holiday season.  I got to do this Santa voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make sure you sign the legal agreement before you do it.

Transcript:  Totally.  I absolutely did Santa.  But I was the youngest by far of four.  So my believing, like everyone's good Christmas sort of hinged on my believing.  So at the point at which I started to get a little skeptical and be like, I don't really get, I mean, reindeers flying and there are billions of houses and we don't have a chimney.  You know, my whole family was like, no, no, this is, you know, don't ruin Christmas.  Santa's real.  And it was bad.  I felt I was like I'm being actively lied to for everyone else's entertainment.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just had a you just have Santa baggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  A lot of baggage.  How about your wife?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How does she feel about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's like presents.  She's cookies and presents.  Not religious at all.  No Santa though.  He's in presence.  Santa as far as Santa involves presents.  It's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fair.  I'm telling you, your mother's going to watch this and you are going to get in such big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm really in trouble because my brother watches this.  So I want you to report back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're already getting the Santa outfits for the baby.  Oh boy.  She's like getting them in the mail like Santa.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like the story of Santa.  I'm not I'm not just I'm just not such a big fan of the like of the lying to your kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  kind of lying to your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I we're so going to get so much email about this, by the way.  I'm getting is it is such a big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, mister from another sister.

Transcript:  Wow.  You don't believe in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You believe in this Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a present for you right here.  Little Gina comes in on my lap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I shouldn't lying is a very strong word, and I absolutely don't judge anyone else who  believes in Santa or teaches their kids about Santa.  It's just not it won't feel right.  The back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, whatever you want.  She's your child.  You can screw up in any way you choose.  That's the beauty of parenthood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  And I'm sure in three years I will have given in.  She'll be like, Mommy, I want to believe in Santa.  I'll be like, all right, if that's that's what you want, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's going to be that little weird kid in Montessori is telling all the other kids, you  know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's the rule.  One of the rules of the game is that you don't.  Ah, good.  And that guy, he's real.  Good.  Good.  Because you know, you don't want your kid to be the one telling other kids that he's  not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Santa an algorithm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Take a break.  And then we're going to come back with our tip, tool and tip and tool and number.  And there was one thing.  Number, tip and tool of the week.  But first a word from Ford.  This is also a commercial.  Using my likeness and the likeness of my new vehicle, I've already ordered my Ford Fusion.  I got the I've been waiting for the plug in hybrid, which comes out next month.  Oh, yeah, I'm really excited.  So I have a must have kind of I have an eight V8.  It's a little bit of it likes gas.  It's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is really fun to drive and it's kind of a muscle car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I thought, OK, I've been driving that for a few years.  Time to drive something a little more economical, make up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you going to trade it in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, Lisa's getting it.  And she has a lead foot.  So it's really not.  It's a net loss.  But I'm excited.  What I want is the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy, which is their plug in hybrid, because and also it is loaded with technology.  This is one of the reasons Ford advertises on Twitter is because they know you guys are geek fanatics, your gadget fanatics.  And you're just going to flip over what the stuff this car like the bliss with the cross traffic alert.  This is the blind spot information system.  What it does, you have two radar.  This is talking about autonomous vehicles, radar detectors in the left and right rear bumper that detect traffic in the side lanes that you can't see.  It's a blind spot.  It lights up a little thing on your mirror there and does a little audio tone saying there's somebody in your blind spot.  Don't change lanes.  It's useful also when you're pulling out of a parking space you can't see around.  It lets you know there's oncoming traffic, the cross traffic alert.  I just love this kind of stuff.  It also has the active park assist.  Now, this is an autonomous vehicle thing.  Watch this.  This is so cool.  So you say I want to park.  You're driving around in Brooklyn.  And it looks at spaces to see one that you fit into.  And then it goes, OK, got it.  Pull forward.  And then you pull forward.  And then you take your hands off the wheel, your foot off the accelerator, keep your foot on the brake.  This was my mistake.  Keep your foot on the brake and you let it go.  And it does this very smoothly and beautifully in less than 24 seconds.  It without touching the wheel, it perfectly parallel parks.  That freaks me out.  That's an autonomous vehicle.  Now, the reason you keep your foot on the brake is because you're still an idol.  And so once this I did not know this.  I learned once you've parked, you turn off the key, you know, but you don't just sit there and go, wow, because the car will continue to roll into the car behind you, which is exactly what happened to me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was so blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was literally I you.  In fact, I would suggest when you get your new car with the active park assist, your new Ford vehicle, that you do this in a parking lot somewhere or something just a couple of times.  Because the wow factories, I mean, this is really what happened to me.  It was like, I can't believe which has happened.  The car drove itself.  It parked itself, which is amazing.  I can go on and on.  There is so much cool stuff built into these new Ford vehicles.  You could take a look at Ford.com slash technology or drive one at a Ford dealer.  Just go to your Ford dealer.  Say I want the 2013 Ford Taurus and the 2013 Ford Fusion.  Both have these technologies available.  Go further and your Ford.  I'm excited.  I can't wait.  I don't know when I'm going to get it, but I'm very excited.  Hey, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  With a plug in hybrid, does the gas engine ever turn the wheels or does it always just recharge the electric and the electric always turns the wheels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you only use the gas engine when it needs to.  When you either exceed the range, I've heard, I don't know, is about 35 miles.  Right.  Or you want to go faster.  You want to go on the freeway like 60.  You need enough power to go 62, I think, or something like that.  So it will directly power the transmission.  Yeah.  So you drive around electric unless the gas is needed for power at a higher speed or you run out of battery.  So the idea is as I'm driving around, I don't drive more than 30 miles a day ever unless I go into town.  But almost nine times out of 10, I'm just driving to the studio or doing the groceries or doing some errands.  All of that will be on electric.  So in effect, you get pretty good mileage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you just showed there, though, that looked like an SUV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the Edge.  The Edge does it.  I did it in the Flex.  You know what's great?  They're putting these technologies in almost all their cars.  So I'm going to get in the Fusion.  But yeah, that was the I think that was the Edge or was it the Escape that they're doing that in?  I can't tell.  It's probably.  It looks like the Edge.  The Edge is very high tech.  A lot of these features.  A lot of these features.  And it was in the Flex.  Yeah, which color should I choose?  I'm trying to decide which color.  That's the hybrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Santa Claus Red.  Should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a bright red Mustang right now.  And I take great pride in the fact that I have only been pulled over a few times in my bright red Mustang.  I think Lisa will get more tickets than I.  The green is bad.  No, the green I don't like.  What do you think, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  If you think that's green, I thought it was a golden sort of color.  Yeah.  But you don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's hard to tell.  Maybe just as we're streaming it, it's not quite so.  That could be, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Red does look nice.  I also just tend to like white.  Black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Black.  The Fusion Energy though, you're not looking at the right.  See, I don't know if they'll have this.  That's the Fusion Hybrid.  You're right.  I went to Climb, so I need to go to Fusion.  The one I'm on is the Energy Plug-in Hybrid.  That's the one I want.  I'm so excited.  And then I'm going to get the 240-volt outlet in my garage because it'll charge in just  a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And can you use this?  Some people were using their Nissan Leaves to power their houses in the Sandy blackout.  Honest to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I bet I could.  You could reverse it, basically.  You could reverse it.  I don't know.  I'll have to ask Ford.  What a good idea.  What a good idea.  Anyway, ford.com slash technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what you forgot, boss.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Change log.  It's time for the Play the Trumpets.  Change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a change right there.  And now Gina Trippene with what's new?  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh my God.  As soon as we played the trumpets, she dropped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Did you hear me?  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, I'm using the wrong camera.  Sorry.  I don't know what happened.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Skype new.  By the way, Google, if you want to make a Skype replacement, Hangouts is not it.  But if you want to make a Skype replacement that uses that technology, we'll use it because  Skype is getting worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what just happened.  It was perfect timing though.  It was just during the bug part of the change log video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.  You're fixing that.  I'll play the video of me crashing the flex.  Somebody posted this on YouTube.  See, we had camera crew in there with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking for a place to park.  I'm going to stay pretty close here because apparently that's what I did wrong last time.  Searching, searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really kind of amazing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Space found.  Pull forward.  Maybe you shouldn't broadcast and drive the next time.  Move hands.  Well, no.  I'm joking.  So there are engineers sitting.  I'm on the Ford test track.  And there's like a Fiesta behind me and there's guys sitting in it.  And I think they set me up because they said, oh, yeah, just go ahead.  And I think they wanted me to crash because they were laughing.  I think they were.  I think this was anyway.  Watch.  Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is so cool.  I take my hands off the wheel.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no.  It's kind of mind boggling when it does.  There's other cars here.  The other actually yesterday.  Look at that.  I'm not doing anything.  Wow.  It doesn't.  Boom.  Boom.  But you re-read it yourself.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I forgot to.  I forgot to.  Yeah.  And they're laughing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're howling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These two guys in the back.  I thought I was going to do the whole thing automatically.  You know, I'm on.  It's very slow.  I'm not moving very fast.  It's just a.  It's, you know, it's idle.  So I didn't.  There was no damage to either vehicle, which is very relieved by the way, because I thought  they're never letting me on the test track again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  Are we fixed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Am I fixed?  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Awesome.  Change log.  Biggest Google launch this week was Google Maps for iPhone, which we talked about very  much.  It's awesome.  We're saving it for the change log.  Yep.  Traffic, turn by turn, navigation, transit directions, walking directions, signage, and  satellite view, street view, indoor photos, zag at restaurant reviews.  It's awesome.  And I think we had another story in the rundown here that we didn't get to, which was like  iOS six adoption, you know, shot up like 29 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People who had iPhones were holding off because they didn't want to use the dangerous.  In fact, we have studio audience.  They're nodding.  They're going, yeah, we didn't want to upgrade.  That's amazing.  That was a huge release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really, really happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, it's funny because Google did said, well, we're not going to put turn by turn into  your map, Apple.  So they did it when they released theirs.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there is a workaround.  Some people don't know this, but you know, when you say to Siri, take me to La La Land,  it will launch Apple Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was my tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, we'll save that because Gina's going to explain how you can get around that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Google Maps for iPhone.  Awesome.  Get it.  New YouTube capture app for iPhone as well.  It's basically it's a free app.  It lets you record either record movies from the app or import them from your camera roll.  This is YouTube capture for iOS.  And you can do basic edits on your clips and upload them to YouTube, Google, Facebook or  Twitter.  So it expands the options behind the single option that Apple Apple offers to share.  Neat.  YouTube capture.  And it's weird if you search for YouTube capture in the app store, it's like the third result.  So just just page over and you'll find it.  Google Music gets the scan and match feature in the US.  This feature was available in the UK for a while, but now it's coming to the US.  Basically, Google scans your local music library when you use Google Music and makes a song  that matches instantly available in the cloud.  So no upload required and features similar to iTunes match.  And it was only available in Europe, but it's coming to the US starting today, I believe.  And that was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course, I've already uploaded all 39 gigabytes of my music, but that's right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Plus new mobile apps for both iOS and Android had been released with a few new features  on Android.  Google's offering full size backups of your photos up to five gigabytes free.  In addition to the standard size option, that's unlimited free storage at 20 48 pixels and  give it a try.  Turn on instant upload and you start taking pictures and your photos that you shoot will  be saved in a private album on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Photosphere opt into that.  Gina on the photos.  What's the default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you have to turn on instant upload.  So I think you get prompted when you first install to turn on and already have it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it going to go to full size photo automatically or oh, yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes automatically.  Photosphere is also coming to the mobile stream inside the Google Plus app.  So you'll need Android 4.2 to create the 360 degree panoramas jelly bean, which we talked  about in an earlier show.  But any video or later user can see them in the Google Plus stream.  A couple other little features, low bandwidth hangouts work better, easier event messaging  and a better hangouts on air experience.  So basically just Google trying to get out there last Google Plus updates of the year.  Blogger got some plus integration.  You can plus mention brands and people in your blogger posts and and that will alert  those people, notify those people if you share your blogger posts then on Google Plus.  So we see the plusification of blogger starting to happen there.  And finally, Google Play Books got a read aloud read aloud and a few other features read.  I actually haven't gotten a chance to try this because I found this.  I found this while the show.  I think it got got got released today.  I found it during while the show was airing.  But Lifehacker reports that the read aloud feature sounds really robotic more than in  other voice command prompts, but it gets a job done.  So it's not not as polished as maybe some other read aloud pay for read aloud services.  But it's but it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you mention the mood button in Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, what's the mood button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe you iPhone users don't have that.  So you I can say I could select a mood and post it on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love, love, love to the early days of my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, this is this is this is so horrible.  But it doesn't matter because it's great.  And then and then let's see, I'm going to put I'm going to send this to all the twits.  And then it does is it makes it like little animated posting.  The end of the world.  This Tony is having a bad day.  Brian Burnett's not feeling well.  He's one of our TDs.  So apparently the the twit staff really took to this big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you when you when you compose a post, there's an option for mood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can have a yeah, I don't think that's on the iPhone version.  But you see, they've they've changed it on.  This is the Google Plus.  They have these buttons now.  This really looks almost like Instagram photo check in mood, right?  They really want to make it all in one.  This is an all in one app now on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is not on iOS.  And in fact, I'm switching back to Android full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you better can give me your new gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you gave you know, I've been using the iPhone and then the next seven.  So I never really switched away from from Android.  But I'm putting my app and truthfully taking pictures of the baby.  They come out a little better with the iPhone.  But I'm going to switch back to the Galaxy Nexus full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've been I've been figuring out I got you know, as you know, you got me to open it and I regret it.  But I'm liking the Nexus four.  I'm thinking I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nexus four is a little all about Android.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to use an Android phone if you're going to host that show.  So here's my Google Plus.  And it really is polluting the Google Plus stream.  It really is ridiculous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's ginormous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God, like something.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like a giant thumb or something.  I don't I don't really get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have been better if they had little Androiders.  Robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody loves the Android robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you know, all of this, it's it's it's for the kids.  They're doing it for the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw the post some time ago from a Googler.  You know, those little stickers you have on the back of the car, mom, dad, son, daughter and the dog.  There's an Android version of that.  Oh, I like that. I want that one.  That great. I'll take that.  A mom, a mom, Android, a dad, Android, a boy, Android, a girl, Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to admit that with the changes they're making with the new apps, which are really nice even on the iPhone and  the communities, I am more and more thinking Google Plus is actually kind of the place to be.  Oh, news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like this big news, Leo.  Leo, that's the first time you said something nice about Google News, Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, not the first time I liked it when it began.  But I but I just kind of know all my friends solely dribbled away.  The communities have been great.  We have five thousand two hundred eight in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Gina, have you joined the Twig community so I can make you a moderator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I got to look. I got to find this one problem.  Now finding is going to be difficult. Leo, did you join?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will I will accept your invitation.  Thank you, Jarvis. Right now.  Talk cloud with us.  You could see Jeff and Gina from the album art there.  And that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I the way the album art thing works.  I could there's no way I could not cut off your name.  That's a trap.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if you go full on it, I think you see the.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So join our community.  Yeah, you just just it's a it's called Twig in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good place to give us.  I added some links that we got to them because we went on for so long about Santa Claus.  But I added some links to the rundown thanks to stuff I saw in in the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who knew that the big oh, like the reggae mashup is in there.  Who knew that the Santa story would be the big story of the week?  Anyway, that concludes the Google change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's so lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Chad.  I hope you negotiated themes for all about Android, Gina.  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying not to come in all gangbusters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Jason was really nice and say, well, if you have any suggestions, something we could do better or whatever.  And, you know, you don't want to be the new person who comes in and is like, we need themes.  But I'm hoping I can kind of already have themes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Jason, you know, is actually the king of that stuff for TNT.  So I have a feeling you would be more than welcome.  I want you to come in gangbusters.  I want you to put your stamp on that show, Gina.  Yeah, I do.  All right.  We're going to rename it Gina Trapani's all about Android featuring Gina Trapani with special co-host.  Yeah, we have a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's one of the the intros that we do on that show.  Hardware. Hardware.  And then we have one for news as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have no words, so they're just sounders.  Yeah, no, it's just it's just audibles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good. I like it.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of your stories I want to see it's on our log is why no Nexus accessories?  Google, Google can do everything well in the world, but it can't do product and retail.  I want to get that cool recharger for this thing.  I want things for my Nexus for nothing.  What a keyboard for it.  Nothing.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll show you a nice case from 10 Tera.  These guys made a Nexus seven case.  It's really nice out of wood.  It's a wood case.  They don't make one for the Nexus for the.  So here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I got myself a note to does it replace the Nexus seven and the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But no.  What do you use, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I usually carry around the Galaxy Nexus and the iPhone five.  Those are like my main day to day phones.  And I've been using the iPad mini a lot for tablet.  I like the note too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just a little smaller than the mini actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you know, and I tried the Galaxy S3.  I just thought it was too big.  But I keep it's funny.  I just moved and I was unpacking a whole bunch of stuff and I came across my Google developers phone from I.O.  like 2009.  It was so small and I thought maybe I need to reconsider what I consider to be a too big phone.  But actually, I was thinking about the Galaxy Nexus because the four.  Well, I have one because they gave them out to the press as part of the review process.  It's not LTE.  And I'm thinking, well, I'm about to go a whole year on the Galaxy Nexus and I'll probably stay on the Galaxy Nexus for another year because perfectly functional Android phone with LTE.  And I don't see any really good alternatives out there.  I really wish that they had made the form with LTE.  It makes me sad.  And I gosh, I wish they would come up with a better email client for Android.  I just want to kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not a Gmail guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, like I said, I like to have my email where the messages are discreet and individual.  I have them grouped and that's what the iPhone does with their email client.  And that more than anything else is what has caused me to shift to using the iPhone more is because I get LTE and I get decent email and I get GPS.  And I get GPS with both of them.  So, you know, for me, the iPhone got strengthened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Android is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree.  I'm a big Jelly Bean fan.  I love it.  I'm living there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not looking back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Windows Phone, better than any both of them is that on a Windows Phone, you can if you're in the Twitter client, you can if you do a search, you can pin that search to your home screen.  And then you just click on the tile and it automatically brings up, say, all the mentions of Leila Port on Twitter and it pulls it up.  And there's nothing like it for for Android or iPhone that I found.  So if you have that unique that unique need, Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We deck with that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the funny thing, by the way, today's news, which we didn't get to because we were busy with Santa.  But the news that Google and Apple and RIM bought the Kodak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, for half a billion dollars.  Well, RIM probably threw in a couple of bucks and some free phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It threw them along for the ride, you know, just as they were begging on the street corner or somewhere in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, RIM stock has been going up.  They might have some maybe some cash.  Really? Who the heck?  Danny, do you want to give us a tip or a tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will. I'll give you the tip.  And I wrote about it on marketing today, which is Google related, although it's about Twitter.  Twitter made it possible for you to download all of your own tweets.  They've been saying they were going to do this for ages.  And I was like, who cares?  You know, what I want to do is be able to search through my tweets that I can't get through because you only let us search through the past week worth of stuff.  And I was amazed.  It's not just that you download it.  But after you download it and open up the zip file, you you click on a little index file that's in there.  It's really easy to do.  And it brings up a whole interface to all your tweets you've ever done.  You can go month by month and easily click to a particular month and see all the tweets that you've done in that particular month.  And on top of that, there's a working search functionality where you can go through, do a keyword search and find whatever tweets you've done mentioning particular words and go then from that listing right to them live on Twitter.  It is a real real boon if you ever have to go back into your Twitter account to find things.  And it makes up for the fact that, you know, Twitter and Google used to have a deal and that used to be how a lot of us I think who were trying to search Twitter used to do it, which was to go to Google.  And since that deal collapsed about two years ago, it's been kind of a mess.  So this is a really nice benefit to come on as much more than I was expecting.  Really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where is this? I'm on my Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have it yet.  It's still rolling out.  So you might not have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you go to a marketing line and you don't see it, I've got a bunch of screenshots in there that will show you what will happen.  It's the third story down on our site.  But if you're not seeing it, I got lucky.  Maybe they enabled my account along with everybody else.  I didn't know it was coming today, but I went in and I looked and there it was.  If you go into settings and you have it, you'll see somewhere in settings down near the bottom, it'll say request your archive and you click on that.  You'll get a little email that comes back to you.  You follow on the email and you can get the download and then you get the little zip file and then away you go.  You start searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really surprised that they didn't add functionality around that themselves.  But that's an opportunity for you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know you did a call.  You did a call for developers to help you write an importer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  My community around ThinkUp is really excited about this and we're working on an importer so you can download this archive and then suck it into ThinkUp.  I mean, you know, I started building ThinkUp because I didn't I wanted to archive my tweets.  And I honestly didn't ever think that Twitter was going to make this functionality available.  I started building ThinkUp.  It used to be called Twitterlitic in like 2009.  So I've been literally hoping for this feature for three years or almost four years.  So I'm really I'm really happy about it.  Yeah, we're building an importer now so that you can import your archive.  And then my hope is to give users the ability to see different insights and stats and also search.  But I didn't realize that it comes with a search, a keyword search functionality.  That's really cool, Danny.  I'm glad they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it must be a HTML file.  I mean, how are they doing this in HTML5?  What is it?  It can't be.  I don't know how they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't.  It was a second take when I went back and I realized that they had the search thing and I did a follow up thing on search and Jelinda goes through it a bit more on how the search functionality works.  But I don't know if they're doing a JavaScript index or they're doing something.  Yeah, it must be a JavaScript index.  But you had to install it.  It was all there.  It takes a moment where it's clearly running through it.  But boy, it runs through all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's running in the browser, right?  Yeah.  So, Gina, do you know what the format is?  Is it an XML file?  Do you know what you'll be getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you get that viewable in your browser HTML version, but then you also get a CSV, which you can import into any spreadsheet.  And then you also get JSON, a JSON feed, which is great for developers.  And that's probably what we'll use to import into the ThinkUp data structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make it very easy to scrape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's your tip of the week?  I think I know because I tipped it off.  Usually you ruin the number.  This week you ruined it.  I didn't.  I actually turned it into a tease.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the new Google Maps app for iOS is awesome.  But all the hooks into mapping functionality on iOS goes to the Apple Maps app.  However, I found this on Lifehacker.  If you want Siri to give you directions using the Google Maps app, you have to add the phrase via transit to the end of your Siri voice command.  So instead of saying take me to the nearest destination here, say take me to this nearest gas station via transit.  And that apparently will launch the Google Maps iOS app.  Now, I haven't had a chance to try this out.  Did you get a chance to try this out, Leo?  There's a video on the...  Yeah, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it launches transit directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It launches transit on Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would do whatever because Apple knows there's no transit in Apple Maps.  It would launch whatever you had for transit directions.  And of course, Google Maps is registered for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Maps is registered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You'd have to then...  I mean, you're now in the transit section, but I guess you could just tap a button and go into the driving section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good.  It's cool.  It's a good hack to know.  This guy's got a nice desktop too, I must say.  I'm moving right along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you played with Udder on the Android yet, Gina?  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that your...  Is it a Twitter client?  No, it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, let me try to...  Udder?  I have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fire away, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it reading your mail?  Open Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fire away, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Open Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open Gmail.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Open Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That kind of thing.  I haven't played with it enough yet, but it's a very nice Siri replacement.  It's calling right now.  It's from Brandall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in a beta.  Yeah, beta version.  Beta.  Beta.  Udder.  There's quite a few of those.  Yeah, this one looks nice.  Nuance has one also that's in beta, because everybody uses Nuance for the recognition.  What is your number, Mr. Jeff?  Jarvis.  Udder, U-T-T-E-R, like udder a word.  Udder, not cow like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not udder.  Udder.  I want to do two quick plugs today.  Out of nowhere, I got this invitation on Google Plus from Google Community in New York, and  they said, we're having a burger get together.  And so I went along to this place, this burger place down 40th Street near me, and there's  a dozen people, two or three from Google, the rest just Google Plus users.  And I didn't know that Google Plus did this.  And they said, oh yeah, we've gone on pizza tours of Brooklyn, and we've gone on Google,  and you pay for your own burger.  It's not freebie or anything.  You know, you got a little swag if you want.  But it was a really nice thing.  It's amazing, huge, gigantic.  Google has these nice little relationships with people.  I thought that was very cute.  It doesn't scale.  People don't.  But it was nice.  But that's not a number.  I also want to mention real quickly that Google is funding journalism scholarships, so look  it up, my fellow journal wonks.  I would do the number one trending Google search for health, it turns out, last week  is hemorrhoids.  But that wouldn't be a very nice way to end the show.  So I will mention that the EFF's good work in patent fixing just got $500,000, half from  Mark Cuban and half from a game developer, Notch Person.  So God bless God's name.  Notch is Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Notch.  He's like a saint.  He's a god.  Well, my kids are fascinated by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, if you're a Minecraft fan, you know who Notch is.  We don't have to explain that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just showed somebody a post today.  I showed somebody a post today, a Swedish reporter who's very nice, Katarina Anderson  was in my office doing a story for her media show back in Stockholm.  And I was talking about the early days of Twitter and Andy Carvin and all that early  on.  And I showed her a post from 2008, which I had to say Twitter, comma, a microblogging  service that allows people to do this and that.  It was kind of cute that I had to explain what Twitter was back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That has changed.  You don't have to explain it anymore.  Now you explain what Twitter is.  That's what explains us.  Yeah.  So I have two tips for you.  One's a quickie.  If you're moving from Instagram over to Flickr, there's instaport.me.  Very straightforward.  I mean, there's an API to do this.  You authorize your Instagram account.  You authorize your Flickr account.  You can download your images from Instagram, but you can also move them over to Flickr.  I did that.  It creates a set called Instagram and all of your pictures are there.  Now I didn't shut down my Instagram account, but now I have my Instagram pictures on Flickr,  which is nice.  And there's quite a few of them.  That is nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Freethephotos.com does it as well.  That's the one I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Instaport does not do that.  It's Free the Photos.  Thank you.  Oh.  I said the wrong one.  Yeah.  Free the Photos.  Freethephotos.com.  It's very straightforward.  It will send you an alert when it's done and then they do not save the images.  It's just a, it's a probably a little JSON conversation.  My other one though is important for anybody using a Samsung Galaxy S3 or Galaxy Note.  There is a whole pretty big one in the Exynos 4 processor and the Samsung kernel code and  any app hack your phone.  So you should be very careful until this is patched.  Samsung's acknowledged it.  They say they're working and have a patch very quickly.  It does give you an advantage though.  If you have one of the affected phones, it makes it very easy to root the phone because  you can use the same exploit.  So there are patches to this.  If you have a Galaxy S2, S3 of international, the USS 3s are safe, a Galaxy Note or Note  There are some issues with the camera because the exploit takes advantage of the graphics  subsystem on the Exynos processor.  And so fixing the exploit actually can break the camera in some cases.  But my recommendation is to get Chainfire's app, which is available at the XDA developers  dot com.  It's called Exynos Abuse.  It's an APK.  So you literally just download it and install it.  You have to turn on third party apps.  And once you've installed it, it's great.  It's a one click root for the affected phones.  Makes it very easy to root.  And I've used Chainfire's software.  So I have nothing, you know, I mean, I can't guarantee you this is safe because I don't  know Jfire, but I've used his software before.  He's a reputable developer in the root community for Android.  When you do the exploit, what's nice is you then, you know, the root exploit, you've rooted  your phone very simply.  I rooted my Galaxy Note 2 from Sprint here, but you also have a checkbox to disable the  exploit.  You even have this, which is nice.  You can unroot the device, which is really great because if you want to do OTA updates,  you'll need to unroot.  So I'm sure Samsung will have an OTA update.  But until then, either be very careful about where you get your apps from because if you  have one of the affected phones, it's pretty trivial to take over the phone.  As you can see, this is a one click root exploit like that.  Exynos abuse at XDA developers.  It's a long thread, a long link, but the thread number is 2050297.  Maybe that'll make it a little easier for you to find it.  Boy, this was a fun and long show.  And I am so glad you were here as the expert on Santa tracking Danny Sullivan.  It's amazing.  Who knew? Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure I'll grow out of it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or your kids or your kids will.  But it's but you're we actually planned that.  That's why we had you on the show.  We knew that would be a big story.  You could find Danny's work at Search Engine Land and not just Search Engine Land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you also have marketing that we just had our first birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't have a chimney, Leo.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't need a chimney.  Santa's magic.  I figured it out.  He uses quantum mechanics.  He actually takes six months to deliver.  But thanks to relativity, he's able to do it in a second.  It's physics.  It's science.  And he'll be in four days, 10 hours, 35 minutes and 10 seconds, according to Google.  So they're counting down.  You'll see Ms. Grinch.
