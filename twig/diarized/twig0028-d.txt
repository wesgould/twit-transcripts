Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi, good afternoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Great to have you in San Diego today, yes?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I am cloudy San Diego.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's only 74 degrees.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We get rain too once in a while.  It's kind of cloudy and rainy here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Jeff Jarvis is just dying in New York.  Is it snowing in New York right now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's stopped now.  I should have brought a snowball in to throw at you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be fun.  I love it when it snows in Manhattan.  Snarls the taxis.  It's great.  People bring out guns.  Also joining us today, I'm really pleased to have him from Mashable.com, Pete Cashmore.  I think Pete, you're in town, aren't you?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, I'm back in Scotland now.  Oh, you went home already?  You got snow?  I got snow.  I can beat Gina on the weather complaints.  Yeah, we've got snow still lying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You had a big Mashable event.  What?  It was just yesterday, wasn't it?  Yeah.  How did you get back to Scotland so fast?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I didn't make the Mashable event.  I was in, I was actually in the States.  Last week I was at the, in for the Grammys and twist up in LA.  And then I was scheduled to come back here.  I should have stayed on.  It would have been awesome.  Yeah, it was your party, man.  It didn't work out.  I know, I know.  We've got another one coming up at South by Southwest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pete is one of the few Web 2.0 entrepreneurs who's in Scotland.  Is that incorrect to say?  Is that a very chauvinistic, stupid American thing to say?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I can't think of any others.  I guess not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm Scott.  My mom's maiden name is Dunlap.  So I have a tartan somewhere.  Fantastic.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I'd like to see you in a kilt then.  Yeah, I want to get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I've got fine manly calves.  Do you have the full dress tartan?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I don't.  People tend to rent them because they're quite expensive.  I don't wear them that often.  I always wanted to have one of those.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we want a twit tartans.  Tartans.  Tweet tartans.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We need to make a twit plaid.  McTwit.  I think it would have to be.  So the big story, I think the big story of the week, but I'll let you guys weigh in on this.  But the big story for those of us who use Nexus One phones is Google.  And I think there's a larger story underneath this.  Google finally ships MultiTouch in an update for Google Android 2.1.  It's 2.1 update one, right, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not 2.2.  It's 2.1 update one, which is kind of strange.  So I'm curious.  I thought that there was a whole patent issue with this with MultiTouch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, therein lies, I think, the larger tale, right, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that there is pissiness occurring in all quarters now.  The report had been that Leo mentioned was that Apple asked Google nicely to pull back.  Apple started snarking at Google about evil and things.  And Google says, nah, nah, back to you.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has thrown everybody under the bus.  It's turning nasty out there.  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For a journalist, there's nothing better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know what the great thing is?  My Dolphin browser had MultiTouch already before I got the update.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, in a way, that's what fooled me because I put 2.1 on it and I'd been using Dolphin, as you had, Jeff, and I love it.  And then the Google's own MultiTouch wasn't as universal, like mobile sites aren't squeezable.  There it goes.  You've just made it disappear.  Is that the maps you're zooming in on?  Yeah.  There's actually a new maps application just came out too.  I think it's 3.4 that adds some interesting layers.  It adds a search layer, which is kind of intriguing.  But I'm going to talk about that later because that'll be my tool of the week.  And I'm going to show you the weird search that I got.  You lost people.  Have you used this search yet?  Because I'm curious if it's just me, if they're saying something about me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I honestly haven't played around with it very much.  I heard that there's a night mode.  Is that GPS mode only or I'm looking at maps right now.  I love the traffic on maps.  Oh, I do too.  They've done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the layers are fantastic.  But save it because there's a surprise.  OK.  OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a chewy candy center on my maps application.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've got to say, by the way, that I used my Nexus One the whole time I was in Europe.  Yes, I got an email on that, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll talk to you in a second about that.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I used my Swiss Sim and it worked very well.  Then I got home.  So I'm adjusting very well.  When I got home, getting the update over the cell wire rather than having to go through iTunes was kind of wonderful.  Oh, yeah.  It just appears.  Big brother-ish.  But boom, there you got it.  Restart.  You're done.  It was very nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I think that this is a nice update.  It enables multi-touch in maps.  It enables multi-touch in gallery.  And as far as I can tell, it's every bit as smooth and easy and fast and intuitive as it is on the iPhone.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That matters so much because before it was driving me nuts not having it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was the big miss.  Well, to me, there's two missing elements and two others are maybe applications that they need.  But the fact that it doesn't do audible books still kills me.  And I hope it will sometime soon.  And the lack of multi-touch.  That really made it hard for me to say to Apple people, no, this is a better phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I'm waiting for things like New York Times apps and Guardian apps and stuff like that.  Yeah.  But the front end I read isn't there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there are good news apps.  We mentioned that Thompson news app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's excellent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  It does a nice job.  I like the widgets, which you don't get on an iPhone that allow us to, you know, I have on my screen, I have, I actually have a whole news page.  The last page on my phone is dedicated to news.  And I have three different news feeder widgets.  One is the Thompson Reuters.  One is a little RSS widget.  And one is, I don't know, Slashdot or something.  And so it's really nice to be able to put those there and be able to just go to that page and get a quick scoop on what's going on and pick stories.  But you're right.  It would be nice to have a New York Times on there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, the last, the two things that don't have multi-touch are the built-in browser and the keyboard, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The built-in browser has multi-touch.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, it does have multi-touch now.  It got it because I was using Dolphin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it didn't.  I was deceived because Dolphin does it everywhere and the built-in browser doesn't do it on Google's homepage.  It doesn't do it on mobile pages.  So a lot of the pages I saw, I was going, it won't do it, but it does do it.  I kept going to pages.  People, I tweeted that and somebody said, no, no, it doesn't.  You just got to go to these other pages.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK.  And now what about the keyboard?  I heard a couple of people saying that iPhone has multi-touch keyboard, but how does, it's been so long since I've used an iPhone.  How does multi-touch work on the keyboard?  What can you do that you can't do on?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Push two keys at once, I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, in what situation?  I mean, shift?  I mean, key combinations?  It's not like you can do keyboard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's another off, I think.  There is some combination.  You're right.  I forget what it is.  But it was also true on the Nexus One before.  There was a keyboard case of multi-touch.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, that's how somebody proved to me that multi-touch was enabled.  Right.  In any event, supposedly this also enables it.  But again, yeah, if you don't use it.  Have you noticed any other shifts in the with 2.1, update one, anything else that's new?  Nothing else.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is only for Nexus One?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh?  This is only for Nexus One?  Yeah, because no one else is using 2.1 yet.  In fact, this is, I think, a big problem with Android in general is that it's as if Microsoft  released Windows 7 but was still selling Windows 98 on.  There are people still using 1.5.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy.  I mean, at what point do they upgrade and what are the barriers?  I don't know.  I've been hearing a lot of people saying, who have the older phone saying, the other  phone saying, like, this is ridiculous.  When are we going to get 2.1?  You guys are getting an update.  We haven't even gotten 2.1.  I'm not sure what the holdup is on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pete, are we leaving you out because you're using an iPhone?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  We're leaving me out right now because my Mac just crashed and I just got back on.  So I missed part of that combo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, all we've talked about really so far is Nexus One, which is kind of pathetic.  I love the Nexus.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  You know, I'm thinking of getting one.  My iPhone contract runs out next month.  So I'll be at South by Southwest deciding which phone to get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've even convinced Jeff, who was very skeptical.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What's your take on the internationalization?  Because I travel so much.  Let me read you something, Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because when Jeff, you went to first before Davos, you were in Germany.  In Munich, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you had trouble, I think.  I didn't have trouble.  I have a UK SIM from Orange and I could not get data going on it at all.  And I found out why, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK.  I rented a Swiss SIM and I got full data.  Right.  But the little trick is if you switch SIMs, every time you do, it wants you to re-authenticate  your Google account.  But it doesn't really make that clear.  So things wouldn't work.  And if you think something doesn't work, you can't get an email.  Nothing's doing.  Go to the alerts and you'll see that it's telling you, no, no, I don't know who you are again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got an email from Sean in Australia who says, as far as frequencies go, it does support  operating frequencies in Europe, which is HSDPA 900, 1700, 2100.  So the only difference is the iPhone 3GS is 850, not 900.  And 850 is for AT&T.  T-Mobile is 1700 and 2100.  Most European carriers are 2100.  Apparently, there are a few 900.  Australia and New Zealand is 2100, 900, and 850, depending on carrier.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the problem in this case was that Orange must not support data for it.  Nope.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He explains this.  He explains this.  Jeff's issues in Germany must have been either account level issues with data not being activated.  In other words, you didn't have a data account or you hadn't turned on data roaming because  that's off by default.  I did that too.  I had data on my old phone and it was roaming.  And I've seen this before.  There's one more thing.  There are APN settings that are specific to the carrier.  And he said, it's possible that the SIM card you put in didn't automatically populate the  APN settings.  So you'd have to go deep into your settings menu and change the server name that you're  getting data from.  In other words, it probably was still T-Mobile and you needed to change it to Orange.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  God help you trying to call Orange and get that set up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  When I unlocked my G1 and put in my AT&T SIM for my iPhone, I had to do a similar thing.  It was really just a Google search away.  Just say, you know, whatever Orange on.  And you'll get the...  And just start...  You can search for APN.  Where does that information storage in?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it just in the hardware set?  I mean, is there...  It's in the software.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's in the settings, in the Android settings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it sounds like, Pete, that this would be a phone that's compatible.  Who's your carrier in Scotland?  Is it O2?  Orange.  It's Orange.  So it sounds like it would work fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who's the vendor that's coming?  The Nexus one is coming to a vendor in the UK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  Right?  I know it was Vodafone.  Is it?  Yeah.  I don't know if Orange or O2...  Is O2 Orange?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's on their page.  Okay.  It says...  Vodafone, it sounds like.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Is Vodafone a Scottish carrier?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's British.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  British, yeah.  So I know Vodafone was the first...  Vodafone.  Yeah.  It's from 2010.  Okay.  And Verizon, supposedly, March.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, at Davos, Schmidt said it'll be on all four major US carriers by, I think he said  March.  So here's the deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to an analyst, anyway, only 80,000 of these phones have been sold.  Is that your number?  I hope that's not your number, Jeff.  No, it's not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have to stay away from numbers.  It's not going crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  80,000 is very...  I mean, in this time period with the iPhone, I think it was several hundred thousand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google's not a retailer, and it's not thinking like a retailer.  I went to a T-Mobile store trying to buy a spare battery for it.  They said, we got nothing for it, man.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very small number.  They pushed it pretty hard, though, haven't they?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead, sorry.  Well, they have.  I mean, if you flew Virgin America with free Google Wi-Fi over the holidays, first page  you get Nexus One.  You go to Google.com, Nexus One.  I mean, they pushed it in every episode.  YouTube as well.  YouTube, every one of their platforms.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's a funny one.  This is another story, but I just noticed today on Google Apps, they've got a whole  new dashboard and an offer of Pro Level on apps.  It was maybe old, but I just saw it for the first time.  But anyway, it pushes mobile apps there.  You go to the link for iPhone and it says, you might want to get really good use of  Google Apps on an Android phone and the Nexus One.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So they're fine.  I was just going to say, Google isn't a retailer, but they want to be.  And I think we're going to see them push this kind of stuff.  Just with the store selling the mobile phone, there's also talk of an app store for  Google Apps, including Wave.  There's also talk about that.  I mean, they want to sell you stuff directly more.  But no, they're not quite a retailer yet.  The thing is that the Nexus One didn't get the kind of marketing campaign that the  Droid did, for instance.  No weird commercials.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  They want to be a retailer, but they don't want to lay overheads of being a retailer,  like customer service and all those things that Google hasn't really perfected.  All that little stuff.  All those inconvenient things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Customers, we don't want customers.  We just want to sell phones.  Well, is it like Microsoft, Jeff?  Microsoft historically has a very, like they're slow learners, but by the time they get to  version three and anything, they really know what they're doing.  You wrote the book, What Would Google Do?  How does Google enter new markets?  Do they start at a run or does it take a while for them to ramp up?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it takes a while, but I think these are wholly new skills.  It's like Google's not a con...  Every time Microsoft tried to be a content company, it failed at it.  Right.  They finally gave up.  Google does not want to be, nor should it be a content company.  Can it be a retailer?  Can it be a manufacturer or designer?  I think the jury is still over the horizon on those things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they're not...  I mean, the HTC is a manufacturer and the HTC did a beautiful job with this, I have to say.  Yeah.  This is just such an elegant phone.  I couldn't be happier with it.  The only thing now I'm missing, there's a...  In fact, I actually have the iPhone out because there's a Scrabble application.  I really wish they had.  But that's why I'm going to buy an iPad because the iPad will satisfy all those like really weird...  And it'll be better for Scrabble.  And then I'll just...  The entertainment.  Yeah.  Now, I have to say right before the show began, my phone crashed.  And I think this is...  When you explain...  When people say, oh, no multitasking on the iPad, I have to say there's some devices you don't want multitasking on.  And I think multitasking on a phone is risky because it's too easy for a program running in the background to cause problems to hang up the phone.  In this case, I think I put a third party SMS application called HandSent on here because it supposedly allows you to change the color of the ball.  Which is a very bad reason to put anything on a device.  Yeah, you know the little track fall down here?  No.  So you can have it glow a different color.  Apparently, that capability is not built into this phone because it never did.  And I don't know, but that's the only thing I did to the phone recently.  And I think it's probably what crashed it.  If you want your ball to change color, that's not the way to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are other bad ways, but that's another bad way.  So that's, you know, to me, multitasking, that's the risk of multitasking.  On the other hand, I sure do like the fact that I can have Google Listen running in the background while I'm surfing the net or things like that.  I think that's really great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So at one point, I don't know how I did this, but I installed an alternative music player and was listening to a playlist at the gym and then wound up hitting the play button on my headphones.  And then that started the default music player.  I had two songs playing at the same time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've had as many as three things playing at once.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it took me a minute to really understand what was going on.  I was like, what is happening?  And it's just like, you know, that really shouldn't happen.  I mean, come on, the phone should be smart enough to know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I like it that you can do that.  I had Pandora running, TuneWiki running and Google Listen running, all three at the same time.  I think that's that's giving the user power, the power to screw the hell up out of your phone.  I think that's OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  How to give yourself a really bad headache.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I had the same reaction.  It's like, what is happening?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Who is talking to you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have to do a Nexus one thing on this show at some point, because obviously there's a lot to talk about.  I have a couple of I have a couple of tools we'll talk about.  I'll do a couple of Nexus one apps.  How about that?  When I become a yeah, because I have I think I don't know, but I'm using an alternate music player that I really, really like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you going to tell us that now?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or is that no, stay tuned or hold them back.  And I want to talk about the shooting war, because I think I think Steve Jobs is feisty as heck.  And he's the one who said he called BS on Google's not evil.  And that's that got Google going.  And he's got Amazon going.  And he started another.  There's another war going on.  This is very interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It really is getting nasty out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait.  We're going to talk about it in just a second.  But before we do, I want to mention our friends at Carbonite.  Carbonite is online backup.  If you don't back up off site, you're not doing it right because, you know, yeah, great to have a local backup sitting right there next to the computer, your hard drive.  But what if there's some bad happens, fire, flood and some bad guys break into your house and steal your backups?  You say that couldn't happen.  It happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  He had his he had only one backup of his computer on a hard drive next to his computer.  He thought he was smart backing it up.  Thieves broke in.  He was in Argentina.  He was in everything.  He says I lost 20 years of scripts.  Just tragic.  That's why I tell everybody about carbonite.com.  It's online backup.  So what happens now, of course, to make for this to make sense, you have to have high speed Internet.  This is going to make sense if you have dial up.  But I don't think anybody listening to this show is still I hope you're not still using dial up.  But if you have enough upstream bandwidth, this is such a great solution.  You can try it right now for free.  No credit card or anything.  You just go to carbonite.com, use the offer code twig and download it immediately starts backing up the stuff internal to your computer.  Won't do external disks.  It won't do network disk, just the stuff that's on your system and your personal stuff only.  But that's what you want.  Right.  And it knows it backs up your pictures, your music, your financial documents, your email just starts that automatically.  Does it in the background?  It encrypts it with AES 256 bit encryption before it does anything.  You choose the key.  So it's totally private to you.  Then it uses SSL 128 bit in a classic case of overcompensation, double encrypt it.  So it's completely private as it's going upstream.  And when it gets there, it is available to you on the net anytime you can sign on anywhere to your carbonite account.  So it's kind of like you've got this in the cloud storage at all times.  If you need to restore it just a click of the mouse.  I love carbonite.  I use it and I encourage you to try it too.  For Mac or PC, go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG.  T-W-I-G.  You can try it for you.  And by the way, if you use the offer code TWIG and decide to buy, you've got to do the trial first.  I insist because I want you to try before you buy.  But if you decide to buy after the offer, you get two free months with the offer code TWIG.  Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.  So did this war start when Steve Jobs at the All Hands meeting called BS on Google?  Or has this been brewing for a while?  What do you think, Pete?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  You know, I've mainly been following the Adobe angle on this one with the flash stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple's basically pissing off everybody.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah.  The flash thing, I wrote a column for CNN last week on, you know, how that's kind of fragmenting the web look.  It's kind of fragmenting the web a little bit when we have Apple essentially saying, OK, we're not going to support flash.  And then HTML5 coming up, which is really, really exciting for everyone, and maybe offering an alternative to proprietary solutions.  But I think it's interesting, kind of the higher level, that devices like app stores, things like the iPad having an app store,  things like the iPhone app store, things like Google now having an app store, Nokia's got one.  Everyone's getting and kind of fragmenting the web into all these little pieces.  And we kind of thought that the web would be united and it would all be, you know, web based apps.  And suddenly everything's fragmented.  So that's really an interesting trend.  And I don't think it goes in any singular direction.  I think we're also going to head back to web apps when we get HTML5 coming up and letting us do even more tricksy things on the web.  But I think it's just an interesting trend with the app store created.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've applauded Apple for this.  In fact, the tweet that I sent out was Apple does so many things that are proprietary and closed that you have to applaud them when they say,  we're not going to include, no, of course they do it for business reasons because we don't want to support Adobe or whatever.  But you do have to applaud them for at least pushing forward HTML5, don't you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is like the debate over Google.  They're also hurting their own device.  I mean, if you want to watch Google, you can't just...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's even more admirable because they're willing to put their money where their mouth is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they got people by the private parts.  And, you know, why not enable the whole darn web on the device?  I think Pete's right.  Where the singularity goes away when you get special use devices.  I want the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, clearly Jobs is lying when he says it's the best experience surfing the web because it isn't.  It isn't the whole web.  It's not.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't...  Listen, I'm no fan of Flash either.  I can't stand the overuse of Flash the same way I cannot stand PDFs.  They happen to both be from the same place.  But the web uses them.  People use them.  And to cut that off, I think, is a bulk...  is an application bulk-inization of the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are other reasons.  I mean, look, there's a lot of reasons Apple could cite.  I think it's pretty clear that they just don't want to give Adobe that much power.  But they could also say that this is a very powerful scripting language.  Flash is not a multimedia player.  Flash is a platform.  You can write applications in Flash.  And it's a back door to applications.  So it may well be that their big fear is, well, first thing we do is it will allow Flash and Google will write Google Voice in Flash.  And we can't stop it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And the Google tablet, which we had more rumors of those this week, but, you know, because Android is open, anybody can create a tablet and use Android, it will use web applications.  And so the web will...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But HTML5 style, not Adobe style.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you can still get Flash.  Right.  I can run Flash on Android, right?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, it has some sort of Flash capability in it right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's already in there.  Yeah.  But Android use Android on a tablet will be more powerful than the Apple.  However, the problem becomes the applications still suck in comparison.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me get back to this shooting war thing.  It seems as if people are a little more feisty than they used to be.  I mean, Jobs was very feisty when he called BS on Google and said Adobe's platform sucks.  Google responds, I think, by putting multi-touch saying, well, all right, up yours, Apple.  We're going to put multi-touch in there.  Yeah.  Come on and sue us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Microsoft is throwing Google under the bus about evil.  Meanwhile, Macmillan pulls its books from Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And wins because Amazon backs down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Amazon.  I don't think the books are up yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but Amazon has said they're going to back down.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I think they've started leaking back.  I just checked in Friday night.  I think the Bits blog had up that some of them started coming back, although Reuters  feed today says it's just the e-books that have started coming back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is with the owner of Macmillan and Davos, Stefan von Holtzbrink, who's a really nice  and smart guy.  And he was practically giggling about finally having a competition in the e-reader space.  So he was happy for Apple to be there just for that reason alone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Jeff Bezos made a rare bad chess move on this one.  Jeff's, I've been very impressed by his ability to strategize and think several moves ahead.  I think putting the speech in the Kindle and strategically pulling back at the right time  was very strategic.  This is not good strategy to go.  So Macmillan says we want you to act as Apple does as an agent for us.  With Apple, we set the price.  They take 30 percent.  Everybody's happy.  That is not Amazon's model.  Amazon sets the price and tells the publisher how much they're going to get.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You think Amazon can stand there and say, oh, we're the friend of the reader or the consumer.  We're keeping prices down, but that doesn't work in PR in this case.  No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think people know that.  But here's what's worse though.  If you pull the Macmillan books as they did, you better not put them back because if you  do, you have not just lost, you've lost because every publisher now is going to say, oh, guess  who has the upper hand here?  I think it has shed some.  Another publisher just announced, okay, we want the same model.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The problem is going to be that the price is up for all of us.  It's the same as Fox managing to get must-carry dollars out of Time Warner Cable.  The money went straight through to the customer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now here's the question.  Does the consumer really mind paying 15 bucks for that book?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we have to see what the price elasticity is here.  What will it do to the sales of books?  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And ultimately we carry the weight because we just don't buy it.  You're going to charge with the...  I think $9.99 was really a weird artificial price point.  I thought maybe, oh, they'll do this for a few months when the Kindle ships, but they've  clearly intended to keep it that way.  And I could see why Macmillan and others said, well, wait a minute.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Leo, I think you're right about the shooting warrant.  And what Pete said is important is that I fear we're going to get to a bunch of closed webs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because everybody says it has their turf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, the Amazon store is just in a way another app store, isn't it?  It's just another closed store that kind of controls what happens within that environment.  Oh, Kev, I'm interested because to me on the surface, this seems like a kind of an  anti-consumer move that kind of is going to push prices up for all of us.  Is that too simplified?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.  But on the other hand, you also have people who are complaining that us poor authors and  writers are losing money in this world or becoming commodified.  I just wrote a post I put up yet about deflation and that in non-physical goods, there is no  more scarcity and any effort to sell scarcity and build an economy based on scarcity ain't  going to work anymore.  And so the economics of media advertising, education, information all change radically.  So I don't think this is, yeah, I think on one level we're going to pay more.  But if you go to the next step, and I think that it's going to yield other unintended  consequences.  So Fox getting money out of a cable company for its TV station is fine.  When the prices go up, the FCC, I believe, will come in and will demand all the card  pricing.  I think we're going to see potential anti-trust action and book pricing here now.  We're going to see people paying more.  I don't know.  I think it's the land of unintended consequences.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It seems like the launch of the iPad, though, is definitely this was brewing for a while.  But it was the launch of the iPad where everything just came to a head and blew up.  It gave us choice.  Open his mouth and right.  It gave us choice.  And this whole conversation started to happen between them.  And I think that the Apple Google thing, I mean, let's be honest, right.  Apple kicks Google's ass when it comes to designing software that runs on your phone  and on your computer.  And Google kicks Apple's ass when it comes to web apps.  Right.  And then they're fighting in the mobile market.  But Apple's way ahead of Google still.  So I think everyone was sort of playing nice for a while there.  I'm not really sure.  I think probably because of other partnerships that they had.  But then when once once I had launched and Jobs said what he did about Google and then  this thing with Amazon that it all just broke open and now everyone's just being nasty and  releasing multi touch and, you know, making new rules.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You also see there was one story on the feed that that Apple's going to refuse any app  that uses geography in advertising serving.  Is Apple's going to try to hold on to that themselves?  Oh, that's bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And then they rejected that app that mentioned the word Android in the description.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This one really this is this is more shooting a guy.  This all helps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This all helps.  Android, I think immensely.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, doesn't Google come out of this is kind of pro choice, pro consumer.  You don't see them making these moves recently.  You see Apple making them.  You see Amazon some extent, although Amazon, you could argue, was fighting for the consumer.  You know, this stuff, Google is the most open, even though they have these app stores.  They have these kind of environments they control.  It's a lot more open as a platform.  So it's pro consumer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And they're including Flash and things like that.  I think so.  By the way, go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was going to change subject.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say just quickly about Kindle Books.  I mean, it's you know, now this is coming from someone who is publishing an ebook and  really struggled with like how to come up with a price point that people are going to pay for.  I mean, the thing is, is like, you know, for someone who spends $400 or $300 on an e-reader,  I mean, do you think $15 is really going to stop them from buying the book at that point?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's still cheaper than the hardcover.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's still cheaper than the hardcover.  And you know, you get it instantly.  I mean, you know, you buy a device that buys books, you know, into your hands, wherever you are.  I just I don't think people who are buying Kindles are really worried about paying $15 for a book.  That doesn't seem unreasonable.  You're right, Gina.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the irony here is that Google kind of gets accused.  The word isn't used, but kind of accused of dumping in the sense that they destroyed value  in the in the directions market, the mapping market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's exactly what Amazon does with books.  And that's what Amazon does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so what we're really looking for here is an open market and we'll see what people are willing to pay.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Amazon's artificially maintaining a price that has nothing to do with demand and it's to promote the Kindle.  What stuns me is that Amazon is willing to throw itself on its sword to protect the Kindle.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, they've sold a lot of them and they see that as their platform for this.  They should be more open.  The irony is that it's the greater control freak that is busting open the control freakiness of Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As far as we know, Apple can't go into our iPads and delete an application.  I mean, well, there's a kill switch.  I guess there is the iBook store.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We don't know.  They might be able to leave books in iBook store.  Who knows?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But if they do that, it's a dumb thing.  I mean, Amazon did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was a terrible move on Amazon.  Google could be in a position to break this open yet more, but the words Google and books right now, terrible.  They're not going to go there.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Competition is good, but you hit the nail on the head, Pete, when you said this is potentially people fencing off the prairie and eliminating the commons.  And that's not good at all.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, it's not good if one person dominates.  I mean, in iTunes, you've got one vendor dominating the music market.  Right now, Amazon dominates books, essentially.  And as you get more competition, iPad, iBook store, as you get all these vendors moving into the same space, you might eventually crack that open.  I mean, could Google potentially get a bookstore and start lowering those prices?  Probably, eventually.  So it could all even out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but again, unintended consequences.  What happens?  You have all this competition in e-books.  Bookstores are just absolutely borked.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, that's a given.  A publisher is going to maintain the upper hand here.  Amazon lets you sell e-books directly now, don't they?  Let you just put up your e-book and they'll be the publisher.  So how long publishers maintain the upper hand?  At some point, Amazon will just say, hey, you want to keep the lion's share of your book sales?  We've got bigger distribution.  You know, it's really about distribution.  And right now, if you want to publish a book, you still go with the mainstream publishers.  Good to get into the bookstores where the distribution is.  But how many users is that going to last?  And Amazon becomes that tick maker.  So this is kind of temporary to some extent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's a, well, let's see.  You were going to change the subject.  I don't want to move on, Jeff, unless you...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just wanted to give Gina props for the discussion of pads last week.  I was ignorant of it.  I heard, have you all seen the Mad TV video?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was everywhere.  The minute Steve said iPad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I feel like I was so out of touch.  I lost my feminine side completely.  And not to get too ridiculous here again, but because of my surgery, even I'm a pad customer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I have to say that conversation has kind of died off though, right?  We're all done with that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're all okay now, but it's so funny that I just felt completely blindsided by that.  I was absolutely surprised.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, me too.  And I was blindsided not by Gina and Heather.  I already knew because my wife and daughter both said, what the heck are they thinking?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It's like the Nintendo Wii, isn't it?  At some point you just...  You get used to it.  ...stop mocking the name.  The Nintendo Wii is quite a good name, I think.  It's not too bad.  I like saying it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love the way the two I's bow on the logo.  I think it's such a clever...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Wii is not such a bad name, but maybe that's just because we got used to it.  Yeah, and it means, you and I, Wii.  What we thought it was when it launched.  Right.  And everybody hated iPod.  I still hate iPod.  iPod makes no sense.  Pod people...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the way it is with brands.  I'm a partner at Daylife.  I shouldn't say this out loud, but I've always hated the brand because it sounds like a spa.  Right.  But you just get used to it.  You get used to it and you forget it, and that's what it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like kids' names or anything else.  That's why I told my wife, you know, any name or whatever you want.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, and don't forget that iTunes now isn't really essentially a music store.  It's a media store.  Right.  I'm glad they came along with iTunes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's a kind of odd thing that they... instead of just saying with iTunes, they had  the iBook store, which first of all is not a very felicitous name, but also why bifurcate  your store like that?  Amazon doesn't have the Amazon A Book store and the Amazon A Shoe store.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I presume I'm going to be able to buy iBooks on my iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, nobody knows.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a good question.  I wondered about this myself.  And are you going to be able to read your Kindle books?  Is that Kindle app going to work on your iPad?  That's what I'm really curious to know.  That will work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or the US Department of Justice will have a very good case.  You can say you can't use the word Android.  That's sketch, but you can say that.  But you cannot start arbitrarily blocking apps.  Remember the...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can you purchase Amazon MP3s on your iPhone right now?  No.  You can't.  Why?  Because Apple rejected the app?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, and this might be their excuse for rejecting a Kindle app, post facto, is  that they reject apps that duplicate the functionality of the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  Does the Kindle app duplicate the functionality of...  It doesn't currently.  It's kind of an intellectual exercise.  Think about it.  It doesn't really.  It lets you read books that you bought from Amazon.  It's going to be interesting though to see what happens with the Kindle app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am shocked.  I thought when the iPad came out that Amazon...  And I think as I said it here, that Amazon...  Maybe I said it on another show, that Amazon would embrace this.  That I said Amazon's in the book business.  They're not in the Kindle business.  They're going to embrace this.  It's another platform, another way to sell books.  I am stunned.  And I think Jeff Bezos really is making stupid moves here.  I don't understand it.  They're protecting a three million unit business over two years compared to a multi...  A business that's so small it doesn't show up on their shareholder statement against  a multi...  A nine billion dollar a year business.  What is that?  That makes no sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if we get to the next level here.  There's a 3D chess going on of net neutrality.  We have kind of the need for web neutrality and app neutrality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We do.  But I do believe we're building these fences.  Somebody in our chat room just pointed out and I think this is true.  Who else built fences?  AOL.  How well did that work out for them?  I don't think you want to start making these arbitrary lines.  It's not good for consumers.  It's not ultimately good for the company.  People want the ability...  Look, everybody knows what we want.  We want flexibility.  We want to be able to take content and put it anywhere and consume it any way we want.  And anybody who does anything to slow that down I think ultimately loses.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the only company that is fully positioned to benefit from that wherever and however  it happens is Google.  The more we use the web the better off Google is.  The more we use the web, Apple doesn't benefit unless we're using their devices.  Amazon doesn't benefit unless they're the ones selling us the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google said this.  They said, we don't care.  As long as you use the web more, we're happy.  I hope they continue to act that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe not a brilliant strategy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they're just a postmodern company.  I mean, it just may be the time has come for this.  Now, a little concern.  Article in USA Today this week, actually, I'm sorry, Washington Post,  that Google asked the National Security Agency  to help it track down those cyber attackers who breached its databases.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's such a bogus story.  Who else are they going to ask? Santa Claus?  The CIA?  Because it was ridiculous.  It was a wired story at first too that just said,  well, the National Security Agency did bad things before.  Now Google is talking to them.  Uh-oh, what does that mean?  Jack, that's what it means.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's because the NSA was involved in wiretapping,  you know, co-opting the phone carriers like AT&T and wiretapping.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and we sold arms to South American guerrillas too.  So Google's going to start selling arms to South American guerrillas.  It's just, I don't mean to be the fanboy defender,  but it's rather ridiculous.  As Google has said, there was a crime perpetrated here.  It's a crime that involves national security.  They report it to the government.  The government decides who's going to work on this.  What are they going to say?  Oh no, I'm sorry. We refuse to work with the NSA?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but here's the concern that they might in part,  in the process of working with the NSA,  give them personal information about us.  Certainly the NSA would like that.  They've shown that interest in that kind of thing before.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, under a different administration,  I do think that Obama's not going to walk down that same rattle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wouldn't count on it.  He's defended them in the wiretapping issues his Department of Justice has,  so I wouldn't count on that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They seem pretty clear that Google wasn't going to hand over personal information.  The knee-jerk reaction has been like, scary, this is bad.  I have to say, I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel a little icky,  but for the most part, I agree with Jeff.  Who are they going to go to?  In terms of the agreement, it sounds like Google decided to work with them  on their own terms without sharing personal identifiable information.  I trust Google to do that.  I make the decision to trust them by using their apps all the time.  At any point, they could share my information with someone I don't want them to,  but I feel a little icky about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As the NSA points out, it's not the first time many, many Silicon Valley companies  have come to them asking for help.  It's apparently a very common procedure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The thing that makes me feel ickier is that there are a report of 36 companies  that also got affected by the same story that haven't come forward.  We don't know what the sanctity is of our data there.  We don't know how much they're helping the bad guys in this.  That makes me feel ickier.  Icky being the operative verb of the day, Gina.  Icky is a good word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to sound like a 16-year-old girl,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  but that was the best word I could come up with.  That we is icky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what's icky? Multitouch. That's icky.  No, I'm just kidding.  Google has filed four patent applications for technology.  It's building into its Chrome browser to make the web a more powerful application,  a foundation for applications.  This is, I guess, the Google Native Client,  a technology for allowing downloaded software modules to run directly on a processor  rather than kind of through interpretation.  Gina, tell me if I'm wrong, this sounds a lot like ActiveX,  the loathsome Microsoft product that opened a million holes on Windows computers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It sure does sound like that, doesn't it?  Don't we all remember a whole thing about your browser being separate from your operating system  back in the day and seems like since it was Microsoft, it was a different story?  Yeah, this sounds a lot like that.  Also, another thing that makes me feel a little icky.  Let's come up with standards, people.  HTML5, datastores that everyone agrees on and build that security layer.  I'm a really big fan of my browser being separate from my operating system  and having this sandbox, this security layer.  But at the same time, Google's obsessed with speed.  And hey, I install a Flash plugin.  Flash does stuff, interacts with my operating system at a level that the browser can't.  So, I don't know. But yes, it sounds a lot like that, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's two initiatives here.  The Native Client technology, which is designed to let web pages send the browser a binary file,  which the computer will execute. Oh, great.  Like you mean a Trojan horse?  And then there's this O3D, which maybe make a little bit more sense,  which allows browsers running JavaScript to write directly to the GPU to increase speed screen updates.  Both are very dangerous.  Now, the patent name is Method for Safely Executing an Untrusted Native Code Module on a Computing Device.  Method for Validating an Untrusted Native Code Module.  Certificates, ActiveX.  Method and System for Executing Applications Using Native Code Modules.  And Web-Based Graphics Rendering System. Yeah, this doesn't smell right at all.  JavaScript is enough of a security problem. ActiveX, you let them run binary. Boy, that's terrible.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is just going to be a Chrome thing. So, this goes way beyond browser standards.  So, this is going to be like, well, if you run our apps in Chrome, they're going to run a little bit better.  Kind of the way it is with Gears now, right?  Like you can do things with Google Gears. You can drag and drop files in a wave, for instance,  or get some offline access that you can't get without Gears.  So, they're kind of letting the sun set on Gears.  It sounds like this is going to be kind of the next step.  Yeah, I'm not thrilled. Love the idea of faster web applications. Don't love the idea of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think it's possible for them to implement it safely?  Or is this just really a bad idea all around?  I'm going to vote for bad idea all around.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It makes me highly uncomfortable. It's possible they can do it. It makes me very uncomfortable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's frankly surprising given how they touted security on Chrome and the sandbox on Chrome.  I mean, it's kind of an odd direction.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if you're talking about Chrome OS where there's nothing on the computer except for the browser...  Maybe that's what this is for.  ...then, well, okay, I feel a little better about that.  It's not like it's going to be able to download some binary that's going to... I don't know.  I suppose it could download a binary that does key logging and that kind of thing,  not if Chrome OS is so heavily sandboxed anyway.  I'm interested to see how it shakes out. But yeah, I lean toward bad idea as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or Icky. Icky. I'll go with Icky.  There's the title of the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think, you know, third time we've got to make it the title now. I mean, there's no way around it.  Ickyness.  Icky. Icky. Icky. I'll tell you something that might also make you feel a little bit icky is Google Street View coming inside your home.  We'll find out in a moment.  But first, a word from our friends at GoToAssist.  The great folks at Citrix have done it again.  I've been using GoToAssist since we did it on the screensavers to help fix people's computers remotely.  Their latest GoToAssist Express is faster, easier, more secure, better than ever.  If you're in the support business, IT or software support, you know that sometimes you just have to get into that computer.  You have to get in there and fix it. You don't want to make the trip.  Use GoToAssist. It's remote access designed for support.  With GoToAssist Express, you can provide tech support online to customers and clients.  Whether they're there or not, there is unattended, which I think is fantastic.  You can fix a problem remotely without being there.  Access files, transfer them from your computer to the customer's computer, which is great for installing a patch or an update, a fix, an antivirus program, malware bytes.  It allows you to have up to eight sessions running at once.  So you run the scan on one and you move to the next, the next, the next.  No more sitting around and waiting for that scan to complete.  I mean, I could just go on and on. This is such a cool product.  They do have month by month, but also day passes.  But I'm going to tell you, I use it for three to 30 days.  But I got now I have to warn you because I use the free trial with my mom and now she she won't let me stop.  In fact, I got an email from somebody who said my mother's paying for GoToAssist Express because she didn't want me to stop.  I haven't gotten my mom to do that yet, but it is a great solution.  GoToAssist.com slash twig.  That's the website. GoToAssist.com slash TWIG.  And you could try it free for 30 days.  With that caveat, you're going to get hooked.  GoToAssist.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support.  So Search Engine Land has a scooplet.  And actually, there's a picture that goes along with it.  A New York City nut and candy shop, Oh Nuts, sent an email to Search Engine Land saying a representative from Google was in there taking pictures.  360 degree pictures of the store for something they called Google Store Views.  In fact, the store sent along security camera images.  Of course, it could just be somebody with a camera.  They don't have a big Google hat on or anything like that.  What do you think? Does that sound like a product?  I guess you, Pete, you also got this email from Oh Nuts.  It says Mashable.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I was traveling that day, so I have no idea if we were at content directly or if we picked up off Search Engine Land.  You know, you see this story and you think, well, that's going to be a joke.  And then you think about it and you see the pics and you read Google's non-denial, which is perfect.  It says, we are always experimenting with new features for Google Maps.  We have nothing further to announce at this time, which is exactly what you do say when you're a spokesperson and you're working on a product.  Because otherwise you just deny it flatly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this would be a great product. I'd love this product.  As long as I know it will come into my house.  I'd let them in the Twit Cottage though.  Oh, no. It's next.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It pretty much wants one shop. Does it wants one store? Does it? Everyone else has to do it.  Because your store is indexed on Google. Your competitors need to get their stores indexed as well.  So it's kind of one of those things that will force everyone else to get their stores indexed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've been moving in that direction for a while because now as a business I can get my Google listing and I can give them hours and pictures and stuff.  And that's now in a business profile that shows up on Google Maps.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Gina, you're next.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say it's free advertising. What store wouldn't want this?  And they took pictures of products. And think about Google Goggles, right?  So the camera goes in the store, takes a picture of a bunch of products, goggles associates that product with that store.  And then suddenly you search Google for, I don't know, Swiffer and you find out the Target down the street has it or the Mama Pop down the street has it.  And this is this just makes sense. I mean, Google's trying to index all the public.  I mean, a store, the inside of a store is a public place, right?  I mean, they're trying to index all public places.  And with tech recognition and the kind of goggle stuff they have going on, it only makes sense.  And as a store owner, I'd be like, come on in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The next step is to give them your inventory data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure. What do we got? What's the price?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're moving to transparent marketplaces so that the price is not going to be the competition convenience, be the competition.  This beats Amazon. You know, it's just down the block.  We got it right now. You know, come on in and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have somebody in the chat room who claims to know says Google has a secret project that will change e-commerce in the very near future.  That would fit in with that, right?  If of course Google's business is perfect information.  Yes. Exactly.  And meanwhile, as you said, Apple is banning GPS location aware applications so they can't say, oh, you're next to Pizza Hut.  Would you like to come in?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I went out to visit Best Buy because of my book, which I haven't plugged in a while, by the way.  And I learned a tremendous amount from them.  I realized that retailers are becoming media companies.  The circular that Best Buy puts out is a media property.  The end caps they sell in the store is media.  Their opportunity is to become more of a community where they bring together smart people who know gadgets.  Leo the Port should be hanging out in the nearest Best Buy and answering people's questions just because he cares the way we do at Apple.  Hell no.  Hell no.  But I think that you start to see a store not just as a shelves of things, but as a media experience where you're going to add more value.  We have the people who know these products. You can try them here.  You can play with them here.  You can compare them here.  That becomes the value of retail at some point.  It becomes a different experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, Cyanogen just tweeted.  There's the book.  What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would Google do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Notice that Leo did that. I didn't.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  How do you index products, though?  Are we going to have unique identifiers for every product?  We already do.  We have barcodes.  That's true, actually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, one of the very first things that the G1 did better than anything else was the ability to take a picture of a barcode and find out where I could get it cheaper down the block.  I think that's great.  I mean, if I have Shopkeeper, I ban cell phones if I can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me go farther and farther.  What if you could find out not only the menu of the restaurant near you, but what ingredients are in things?  And why not?  More data.  Perfect data.  Yeah.  Gina's right.  I can't see a negative to this, really.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I would say with hotel room.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's an outgoing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hotel room.  You're GPS to a hotel room.  You're looking at street view.  You say, let me go inside.  You walk through the lobby.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I guess if you're going to be a cynic, I guess you could kind of if you were criminal, you might want to see how all the stores are laid out where all the most expensive stuff is, plan your route kind of thing.  True.  But you can do that now.  I guess you're skeptical.  Yeah, you can just walk in.  Exactly.  But it certainly saves you having to do the you know, you're certainly not going to go and scout out a place with a bandana or sorry, a balaclava on.  You know, if you've got to go in and check out the place kind of as yourself at some point and then there's tapes and so on.  I'm just trying to make the devil's advocate argument here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.  That's what we bring you here for.  You are the devil.  The devil.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  There's a case for you.  It's a case that you could check out a place before you without ever even setting foot in it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If the devil were to were to personify, of course, he would personify as a handsome, smooth talking Web 2.0 entrepreneur in a kilt in a kilt with a sporen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, but I think the word you raised here that's very important, Leo, is public.  This is a debate I keep having in Europe.  Europeans go nutty on on privacy and publicness.  As I mentioned last week in my in my very tired stupor from Davos, I've become an addict of of of saunas now.  And I'm amused by the Germans who are very, very private about anything, everything, except as I said, their private parts and they're going nuts with street view and say, no, you can't take a picture of me on the street going to this place.  Well, that's the public and we should defend the public because the public we the public own the public.  We can comment on it and analyze it and and see what's there.  So any place of public accommodation, a store, a school at some level, there's issues there, too.  But at some point we have to define the definition of public in this new data age.  And I think we've got to defend the public a little bit because we go nuts nutty on this privacy.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm with you on that. Of course, you and I live in public in some strange, bizarre way.  I was almost I tell you, I was almost bit by this one.  I almost fell for the Jason Calacanis style Twitter misdirection.  Cyanogen on his Twitter about 15 minutes ago posted this.  Today, I decided to stop development on the cyanogen mod and buy an iPhone.  Sorry, fans. Now, Gina, before you have a heart attack.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Scroll up. Scroll up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because then the next tweet, haha, my friend stole my phone. I was pwned.  He caught me entering the lock pattern. So so that was close.  Yeah, I'm glad I didn't run with that story. I almost did.  You must constantly have that kind of like, you know, moment of, oh, we're glad we didn't we didn't cover that story.  We could have. We could have been bit. Yeah, probably quite a few times a week.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What's great about blogging, though, is that you can you can fix it.  You can put up what you have and then update, which is kind of the new way of doing things.  I think you have to get some kind of strong signal on there. You have to go and check it out somehow.  But you've been very good. You have the power to correct.  I mean, I speak to journalists all the time and they say, you know,  what really frustrates me is is that I put out the story and the next day I learn it's wrong and there's no way I can get all those papers back.  I think that's the fantastic thing about blogging that we can update as the story evolves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's your policy? I'm sure this is the case.  I mean, some blogs will delete it and pretend it never happened. I'm sure you strike through update.  We got it wrong. That kind of thing. Yeah.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  So what we do is we get an update right at the top and then we put out a tweet and a Facebook message that just says, you know, update and then whatever information that we don't hide.  You don't hide what you got wrong, though. You leave that there.  No, I think you need to be really clear about that stuff.  And I think, you know, the fear is that people aren't going to trust you if you put up something wrong.  But I think if you put up the wrong thing and then put up the right thing right above it, that actually builds trust.  It says, hey, they get things wrong sometimes, but they're correct.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Where you lose trust is where you hide and pretend and say, oh, we didn't get that wrong.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the deleting in the age of RSS, you can't delete a blog post. Once you hit publish, it's out.  And yet there's still people who do it.  It's crazy. To me, that means that they don't know what they're doing because people have copies of the RSS item in their desktop feed reader.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry, we can prove it. I've got Google cash.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It turns it into a big story, doesn't it? Because people go through the cash and they'll try and figure out why did you delete that?  And it makes an even bigger thing when you try and hide these. It's that whole problem of when you try and try and hide stuff, it makes a bigger, bigger issue.  Tell the truth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's another breaking story just came in from ZDNet in a tweet. News is getting twittered now. This is how you break news.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love the Saturday afternoon live on the air.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Eric Schmidt tweets, quote, can't wait to watch the Super Bowl tomorrow. Be sure to watch the ads in the third quarter.  Someone said, hell has indeed frozen over. Sounds like Google's bought an ad on the Super Bowl.  So what would that be?  This is the question for the panel. I love it. What if you're Google, you're spending more than what is it? A million and a half, two million dollars for a Super Bowl ad.  What will that ad be for Pete Cashmore?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Probably. Well, it's going to be the next one, isn't it? But it'll probably content focused in terms of, hey, this is what you can do with it rather than device focused. I would imagine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will they do there's an app for it?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Along those lines, I'd imagine.  They could easily.  It's going to be about what it enables rather than what it is because we're all like enamored by hardware, but really real people care about what can you do with this device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, you have a two million dollar check. You can be on the Super Bowl. What do you advertise?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's a way to ding all these competitors and Google, as we've discussed in recent weeks, at least in the media level, Google has a PR problem.  I think we agree that it doesn't on the on the customer level, but I think there's a way for Google to start to change the agenda about Google.  And they're becoming more and more of a consumer brand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, they don't do a Bing style search ad, do they?  Oh, God, no.  I hope not. Those ads are so horrible.  But I think it may be more than the Nexus one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's a bigger brand issue for Google to present itself as, you know, and all these other people are trying to close down walls.  We are your real friend. We give you things for free.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You think so, Gina? What does Google spend its two million on?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm thinking it's probably going to be the Nexus one.  Although I don't know, I kind of can imagine an ad for like Maps or Chrome or just like Google Apps in general.  Like, look at all the cool stuff Google gives you, you know, or just like maybe a walk through somebody's day using Google Apps, the phone, the search, the maps, the every, you know,  it might just be like shiny, rosy Google's your friend ad, just like Jeff says.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't there a risk, though, the backlash that, oh, Google's everything.  They got my, you know, like their fingers are in my pocket.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Rump your nose.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are the chances that Google has something brand new?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, it could be the other thing it could possibly be is like a Chrome, well, you know, Chrome ads,  because they're really trying to push them on all their various platforms.  They're trying to push Chrome. They're trying to push the Nexus one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've been advertising that more in the UK, I think, Pete, than here.  You know, we've seen two bads in the UK. I haven't seen anything like that for Chrome here.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, but I would just say those are the two devices that are really trying to push to a mainstream consumer audience.  I would still side with the Nexus one, but that's the only other possibility.  I don't think they do a general one. Who doesn't know what Google is right now and who doesn't?  Yeah. But most people you ask them Google is search, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Google apps, Google apps. Yeah.  I think people don't. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. People know that Google search, but do they know about Google Docs?  They knew about Chrome. They know about Android. They know about Maps. You know what I mean?  There's a business audience there. You're right, Gina.  And there's a case for them to advertise apps. They've been pushing apps. They're going to open up an app store for apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Say again?  I've gone to your Google Apps dashboard lately. To me this is brand new today.  If you go to the Google Apps dashboard you have, it now pushes a $50 a year higher level use of them for enterprises and such.  And go to your, let me see here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just looking at it right now. I'm in my Documents, Google Docs. Oh, you mean apps. I should go to apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to apps and then go to manage this domain.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the pro version. No, they've done that for a while. They've been pushing that for a while.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The look was all different to me today. Try the Premier Edition free, create new users and so on.  And they're just trying to push a slightly different, I think, enterprise view. They're trying to get more enterprises to use it.  So I guess there's an off chance they could use the money for a business app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've been buying billboards here in Silicon Valley at Google Apps saying, ask your boss. Tell him, you know, saying go to the higher ups and say you want Google Apps.  They've been trying to do this grassroots thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it could be an enterprise, right? Because that's not unusual for during the Super Bowl, right? CEOs want that at the Super Bowl.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is the hell frozen over comment merely that Google's buying an ad?  I think so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about, okay, what if it's a Google Wave ad?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's definitely not going to be Wave.  It is not going to be Wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've inadvertently converted this to a comedy hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We own the future and you don't understand it. Only Gina does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe it's an ad for Gina Tripati. Look, we know you don't like Wave. We don't, you don't understand Wave. Read Gina's book. Then it'll all make sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For those of you who are before we keep on the show today, I told you that I talked to Nick Denton and told him that he had to talk to Gina about Wave and understand how important it was. And Gina said that you talked to him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mentioned that Adam and I wrote the book on Wave and he looked at me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that was it.  Nonplussed with a blank look, a blank stare.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then I continued. I was making another point about publishing in the Wiki format versus the GLOG format.  We were having the old reverse chronological order, the bad parts of that and the good parts of that conversation.  And I was saying, well, if you want to thoroughly document an evolving product when it comes to software, you want to do it in a format that's more like Wikipedia versus the reverse chron.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, but wait a minute. What if they tell everybody watching the Super Bowl to do the Wave?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That counts. That might work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Alright sports fans, we're going to take a moment in between plays to do the Google Wave. Everybody now.  No, I don't think that'll work. More than two billion businesses, two million businesses run Google Apps.  So this is they're trying to make they make money on this. They sell it 50 bucks a seat.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they're talking about opening an app store for apps.  So developers can make app specific. So they're basically going to make a store that runs on a web application.  This is kind of a different. This is different. No one has done this before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we've hit on it. I think this is what it's for.  That's the only thing I could think of that they'd want to spend that much money on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Except for besides the Nexus One.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't imagine them. I think they they realize the Nexus One is a loss leader and it's really more of a reference platform than the future of Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does seem late for them to be doing this, the Nexus One.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm looking up here. Forbes says that Google's doing something with Kia for its Super Bowl ad.  Oh, how disappointing.  Kia.  Google is working closely with Kia and all the Super Bowl sponsors offering them exposure beyond TV.  The marketers that are paying 2.8 million.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now Kia has done an interesting thing. They are the second company to introduce Microsoft Auto, the software behind Ford Sync.  They're doing a similar very similar product to Sync using Microsoft Auto.  Wouldn't it be interesting if Google had won them over and got them to use Android instead?  Android Mobile?  Oh, that would that I you know what? That would be a very interesting product.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was going to ask you about this, Leo, because you know, my we have one Prius in the house and the brake problem is evidently a software problem.  If you had a truly networked car, we should be able to get a download to that car like I can to my Android phone, shouldn't I?  Yeah. Yeah.  Click my ride indeed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you think they would announce a product like that during a Super Bowl commercial?  I suppose that seems like that would happen at CES, right?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Oh, John Battelle says it's a brand. Hang on.  We're all searching Google for it.  He says it's a brand campaign. It's not selling anything here other than its own brand.  So we're more than search. Google. Google. It's more than search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google is 10,000 people working hard to make it.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  There's even an ad. If you go to John Battelle's search blog at battellemedia.com, he says it's going to be this ad which is called Parisian Love.  It's a brand ad. He spoiled it for us all.  He's got it.  He does have good sources at Google, though, I believe.  I believe in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Here it is. It's on YouTube.  This looks kind of interesting. I'll play.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is a search ad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apparently it's a search ad, which you think Google doesn't need to do. Here we go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is a...  Do you mean Louvre?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Study abroad. Paris, France. Click.  Cafes near the Louvre.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's funny that they're doing French since the French can't stand them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Translate to a très mignon.  You're very cute.  Impressive French girl.  Chalking shops Paris.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What are truffles?  Are they really going to run that during the Super Bowl?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope not. Who is Truffaut?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not exactly very testosterone.  Beef eaters hate France.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is just going to piss people off.  It's Google. If you like France, you'll love Google.  No, that's wrong. That's just wrong.  Churches in Paris.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Geez, idiots are record monkeys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How to assemble a crib.  It's a cute ad, but I can't... That's not the...  It's a cute ad. That's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it does feature a lot of things about search that a lot of people don't know how to do.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  All American thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The last thing they're going to do is...  Now, so there's other ones in this series, so I'm not sure. This is the one called Newbie.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What's interesting is that John wrote this before Eric did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These are some other ads. And notice the dates on these searches are like 2008.  This is an old ad campaign.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I'd be smarter than that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, France would be a huge mistake.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't do sissy French stuff on Super Bowl. I'm sorry, you just don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This one's also a little more lively in terms of the music. This one is all social media.  Tips for going viral. They search Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Mattel's practically trying to take credit for Schmidt's tweet, which I think is probably a little much.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These are old ads. Apparently, I'm told by the chat room, which knows all these are...  I've been on Hulu before.  So nothing there. It's all smoke.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So we all think Nexus One are apps.  I think we're in agreement apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apps, show of hands.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Pete's not...  I see the point on apps.  Nexus One's got a bit more broad reach.  Yeah, the Nexus One is going to piss off their early customers.  Tell your boss.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The machines became aware.  February 7th, 2010.  Skynet, new from Google.  What do you think?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He could do to Steve Jobs what Steve Jobs did to Bill Gates and do a new Big Brother commercial.  Apple is the new Big Brother controlling everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh my God. Then with the shooting war, that's the nuclear option.  That's mutually assured destruction.  That's pretty cool though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love it. We want it. I want it.  Google never mentions their competitors though.  I don't imagine them doing an ad that addresses their competitors.  I don't know. I'd be surprised.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They won't. I love the idea of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why Bing sucks and Apple is...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, why Apple is the new Big Brother?  They're the control freaks. We're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What if they did a 1984 commercial?  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, you mean like the...  Yeah.  And it's Steve Jobs up there.  Yeah.  Oh, they better do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All this has happened before and all this will happen again.  September 4th, up here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be...  You know what? They would win a lot of fans if they did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It goes back to what we were saying before.  Apple has become the new control freak company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have Steve Jobs going...  And then somebody with a Google shirt comes and throws a hammer through it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you looks like Bear?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm getting chills. Yeah. Bear our sysadmin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would just have to list all the apps that have been rejected.  There you go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There you go. Things you can't do elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These apps will never be heard on the iPhone.  They're not apps for you to use.  Never speak the word Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be awesome.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That would be kind of awesome.  I would be so...  Why 2010 won't be...  I might just watch the third quarter of the Super Bowl now.  Like 1984. We're not going to have anybody watching Twitter tomorrow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're all going to be watching that.  All right. Let's see.  I think we've done enough damage for the day.  Let's get to our...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to plug one thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Plug away Mr. J.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I was in Davos at the Google party,  I did the flip camera dance with none less than Tim Berners-Lee.  Oh, wow.  And so we were both doing our flips at each other.  It's just kind of wacky.  But to do that with him of all people,  it was my celebrity moment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The inventor of the World Wide Web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's very careful to say, yes, he's the inventor of the World Wide Web,  not the creator of the Internet or of the Web,  the inventor of the Web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The inventor of the HTML and World Wide Web protocols.  Actually, I don't even know if you can give him HTML credit.  Inventor of HTTP.  Is that video on your blog?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I put it up on the Delicious.  And while I'm plugging, the other thing I want to plug is today  is son Jake Jarvis' 18th birthday.  Happy birthday, Jake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Happy birthday, Jake.  Yay, Jake.  We were talking about him the other day.  We were trying to think of who.  We were thinking of doing a Facebook show,  kind of like we do a Google show.  And we thought, well, who do we have represent app developers?  And I said, well, Jake, of course.  Be good.  Be the first father-son team.  By the way, there is a DaringFireballWithComments.net  that has DaringFireballWithComments.  I saw that.  You see, nothing's safe on the Web.  Nothing's sacred.  And now, the tip of the week.  Ms. Tripani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  This is a really simple one, and it's for people who have filled out  their Google profile and searched Google when they're signed in.  Scroll to the bottom of your search results.  There's a new module, which it's new to me.  I don't know.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Actually, Pete probably knows when it rolled out more specifically.  No, it's new to me as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I saw it yesterday.  Yeah.  The header is results from people in your social circle.  I'm in Caprica, and if I scroll to the bottom of the page,  I see tweets from people I follow.  And Google knows this because I've entered my Twitter feed  on my Google profile.  Blog posts from contacts, Google contacts, about Caprica in the list.  And the results are okay, but it's pretty interesting.  It really feels like, whoa, how does Google know that I know these people?  But they're connected.  Google has indexed all the people that you follow on Twitter  and figured out your friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it starts with your profile.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You have to have a Google profile filled out.  And the more information you have there, obviously, the better.  If you list your blog, you list your Twitter, that kind of thing,  Google will figure out who your contacts are on those other services.  This is really cool.  Scroll to the bottom of your page.  Results from people in your social circle.  It's in beta.  And there's a couple other smaller links, My Social Circle and My Social.  So you can see what people Google knows you're connected with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dave Weiner wrote a blog post about this called The Two Way Web,  The Two Way Search.  And he seems to think that this is a huge step forward.  Others in the comments say, I don't know.  I mean, that's kind of intrusive, isn't it?  But I mean, this is what search is all about.  Well, this is the way the web is going.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I mean, what's Google supposed to do if social search is the next big thing,  if everyone else is looking for recommendations on Facebook or Twitter for everything?  Google's got to get into this space.  I find it interesting that they're doing it by adding more and more stuff to search.  And I wonder if there might be a smarter interface they can kind of innovate around  instead of just keep adding more and more stuff into my search interface.  I've got real-time streaming tweets, then I've got images, videos,  then I've got at the bottom here, I've got social search.  It's just like all these extra pieces.  I want different views.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I think at some point they play with them and see what they do,  and then they'll come in together.  Like Google News was around for a long time before they added it to Universal Search.  Right.  I think you're right, Pete, but I think at some point they just want to play with it in isolation,  and then they'll start to bring the singularity together,  in which case there's no Universal Search anymore.  Your search is different from my search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dave, that's an interesting point, too.  It's been that way for a while, though, hasn't it?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I mean, even if you log out of Google, they still look at your IP and customize your search.  You can't actually get away from it.  Because I would love to see what...  You know, that was a great way of checking your search results before you log out of Google,  see what everyone else is seeing.  It's becoming harder and harder to do that.  Why don't you just...  Go ahead.  I've got a question for you, Gina.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  So I use two Google accounts.  I use IMAP, my Buzz Machine address, and I use Gmail.  That's the main one I use.  So my Google address there is my Gmail, is my Buzz Machine address,  and then I use another one for my university stuff.  So Google keeps on thinking that my account, my Google account, is my university address,  but in fact, my main one is my apps address.  How do I get Google to understand that my apps address is my Google account?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In what context? In the Gmail application?  Just in this context, in profiles and other things.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can't sign in...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't it just whatever you're logged in?  Oh, you can't sign into that account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can't sign in using my...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, your apps account.  You can't sign in with your apps account on every Google service.  And it's really annoying.  And it's actually a problem that I have as well.  I have an apps account and then a vanilla Gmail account.  And in fact, Google Voice doesn't work with apps,  so I actually have to maintain my contacts list on my vanilla Gmail account.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not...  That's dumb.  It's not any...  It's dumb. It's dumb.  And they really need to give full support to apps users.  So yeah, I mean, the way I solve the problem is probably the worst.  It's the worst solution ever, is I just maintain my...  I maintain a separate contacts list on my Gmail account,  my regular Gmail account anyway, just to use Voice.  And so my social...  If you click on your social circle, mine is very well filled in  because I keep that list updated.  But yeah, I know it sucks.  For people who are just app users, you really...  You have to maintain a regular Gmail account,  which is not going to get people to move to apps.  Move to apps? No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google's not as fixable.  Even hooking up my Nexus One,  I want to use my apps account, but I had to use my other Gmail account.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you can sign into the Nexus One.  You can sign into Android, like the initial sign in  when you set up the phone or change your SIM.  Yeah, you can sign initially, but for other things like gallery and Voice,  you have to sign in with your regular Gmail account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you not merge them by adding the apps somehow to your main account?  I mean, it seems like you could merge.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, some things just don't exist on the app side.  Like, Pocasa Web, as far as I understand,  Pocasa Web Albums isn't available for your apps account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But can't you merge your apps account into your Google account somehow?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I took my contacts and I exported them out of my apps account  and imported them into my Gmail account, which had gotten out of date.  So yeah, you can, but there's this constant, like...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As the opposite, my apps account is my main account.  I'd rather merge my Gmail into my Google account, into my apps account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just thinking that if you made your apps email address  be one of your official addresses on Google, on your Google account,  wouldn't that do the job of merging the data?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But if I want to sign in with a Google account, I can't use my apps address to do so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I guess that's the question is why doesn't Google,  knowing that you have this account, this account, this account,  all associated with one Google account,  why doesn't Google take that social graph from all those accounts?  Or maybe it does though. Do we know that it doesn't?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sometimes you can sign in with your Google apps full email and domain,  and sometimes it says, what is your username at Gmail?  So you have to use your Gmail account. It depends on the context.  It's a problem. It's a problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do they even really have the knowledge that we all have multiple Google accounts?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they just recently on Android did, right?  Just recently there's multiple account support in Android.  It used to be that it was just a single,  meaning that you can get your Gmail from different accounts in the Gmail app.  Yeah, you can do that. In the Gmail app, if you just go into settings,  you can sign in with a couple of different Gmail accounts, which is handy.  So I have my Gmail account and my apps account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't mean to derail this, but I needed to mention it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, this is something a lot of people are actually thinking about.  So I think it's a good subject.  I have all my email addresses are verified with my main Google account.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But Leo, you have a Gmail account, like a Google account that you sign in,  that's your like Leo at Gmail, and then you associate your other addresses with it.  Yes.  But all the data associated with that Google account, your contacts and all that,  that's in that Google account. You know what I mean?  So when we sign in with our Google apps account, that's a separate Google account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the question is, do you want them to all have it merged,  or do you want the granularity of saying, I'm going to be on the Google apps account today,  I'm going to be on the other account today, the Gmail account today?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, for me, I just want to sign in with my Google apps account.  And have it know everything.  And I want gallery, I want voice, I want everything.  But not every app supports Google apps accounts.  So like web albums and voice, you can't sign in with your apps account.  They want a Gmail. You have to have a Gmail account to use those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It has to be a Gmail address, yeah.  I didn't know that. Okay. Well, yeah, that's bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thank you.  Unless I'm wrong, but I've poked around, I've heard from people email me and say,  you know, apps is great, but I have this problem, just like the problem that Jeff brought up.  So I maintain basically two accounts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I have multiple Gmail accounts. I don't have an apps account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should try the apps account.  I will. I do.  Especially as they're doing all this new stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My sister in bear tells me I have an apps account.  Who knew?  Well, I'll just have to try logging into it.  Tip. So was that your tip?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the tip was, yeah, scroll down and check out the results from your social.  That's right. Oh, God, we got so derailed.  Okay, yes. I remember that now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Your social graph is now part of Google search results.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you get freaked out, like, how does Google know that I know these people?  Click on the My Social Circle link and it will say, like, we know you know this person through your Google contacts.  We know you know this person through FriendFeed.  We know you know this person through Twitter.  It's pretty open about how it has associated the connection so you don't have to feel like.  Facebook is there too?  Just FriendFeed and Twitter, from what I can see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So let me ask you this, Gina, because on my Google profile, it says add an alternate email address to your account.  You can use alternate email addresses to sign into your Google account.  And so I have all of these addresses verified and I can sign into the same Google account with all of them.  That can't be your apps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So when you sign in your Google account, you can use a non-Gmail, you use a different non-Gmail address?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. It says alternate email addresses can only be associated with one Google account at a time.  So my main Google account has, you know, is laporte.gmail.com.  But then all of these other addresses that I use are associated with it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  Where do you get that, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just in your user account settings.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay. Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I don't know if that gives you the result you want.  I'm just not sure it does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's kind of reversed.  We'll try it next week.  Give it a shot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to look into this a little more because I've been hearing from listeners about this, asking about this as well.  So yeah, I'll see if there's a solution or if you can do that.  But if you associate your Google Apps account with your Gmail account, you kind of have some recursion going on.  I wonder, are they smart enough?  They might say like, hey, this is a Google account already.  I'll check it out. I'll look into it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what's my Apps account address?  Do you know? How do you know about my Apps account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We created one as a test and ran into all these problems also.  So we haven't exposed it to you.  So there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you're confirming what we're saying, which is it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the problem is it's Google Apps is in a different authority domain inside the Google system.  I see. There's your problem.  So there's a fire.  They have a single sign on for people who use apps regularly, but not for the consumer Gmail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, you're confirming then what we've said.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I like that you have your own nurse ratchet there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know. He just sits here all the time.  Anytime I need him, he's there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's shielding you from the difficulties.  We decided not to inform you.  Good to know that does that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We created an account, but we decided not to inform you.  We'll let you know when it's safe for you to use.  This is the kind of service you get when you're president of the Internet.  I just want you to know.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The week is simple, but Google is awarding five point seven million dollars in Google focused research awards.  They've had more than one hundred fifty fellowship awards out there, but this is they're saying a bigger deal.  And they've put them out in four areas.  Machine learning one to use some mobile phones as data collection devices for public health and environment monitoring.  Three, energy efficiency and computing.  None of these terribly surprising before I was amused by this is privacy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.  They should put money into that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I also like that it's kind of the Bell Labs of the future.  It's it's a virtual virtual Bell Labs, not quite pure research.  In this case, it is focused on things that help Google, but more research is good.  And I think Google is going to end up supporting Google and companies like that are going to support research as much as universities going forward.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I had a lot of different possible applications for me, but I think since we started talking about it, I will focus on this one.  Let me let me change cameras here so you can see what I see what I'm about to show you.  Sign that to there. OK, so this is my.  And I'm not going to do what Sanogen did and show you my pattern.  OK, now we got it. So a couple of couple of different things on the on the phone.  Of course, there's a new maps application, and I think they updated it today to three point four.  And it has some new layers that you can put on there.  I went to labs to turn on some of these buttons.  There's a labs layer, but there is a search layer on there.  So apparently this is from common searches in this area.  I was kind of shocked when I saw that the search layer on mine is for the term mature sex.  And and I and I have to tell you, this is not something I ever searched for.  And apparently I'm finding St. Paul's Episcopal Church as one of the results.  So I don't know what happened here, but seriously, this is nothing I did, but it's just a new feature.  Really, honey?  I want you guys, would you get the new map and tell me if this this is the personalized search?  It's apparently common searches in your area.  And I'm just curious what you're getting because because I'm taking this a little bit personal.  There's also a terrain and traffic.  And you said, Gina, you really like the new traffic layer.  That's just really handy to be able to see. I'm not getting train or those kinds of things.  You have to turn that on in the labs. Oh, thank you. Yes.  But so the new maps has some very nice features you might want to take a look at.  And the the labs stuff is available somewhere in the settings.  More under the more menu. Of course, under the more menu.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A whole new world Easter egg. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Scale bar, which is nice. Terrain layer, which shows you, you know, topography, vegetation, elevation, popular categories, the layer button, a compass arrow to show you which way you're headed.  Traffic with labels.  So we turn them all on.  Bubble buttons is great because you can if you click on a business, you can actually get directions and the phone number right right from the map.  Distance and heading. It's kind of a measure tool.  But the search layer, I think, is turned on just automatically.  I think that's part of the new thing. And then, Gina, you mentioned a new music application.  I don't know if this is the one you were thinking of, but this is one I've been using.  It's called Tune Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love Tune Wiki.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So first of all, has a great little widget.  But one of the things that's cool about Tune Wiki is it looks up information about the song as you're playing it, including lyrics, which it will play in many cases in synchronous with the music that sweet.  It's a really cool user generated information.  It is a I guess on the web as a wiki and it and it's a player.  It plays video, plays music.  If you're listening, it has radio, Internet radio stations, shoutcast, last FM.  And if you are listening to a song, you can press the music button or rather the video button and it will find a video of it on YouTube as well.  So a lot of nice features. This is a really cool little player.  And this is why I really enjoy the the openness of the Android platform, because you can get some really interesting.  You know, Apple would never let this on because it supposedly duplicates a function of Apple's own making.  But but the iPod player doesn't do anything like this.  So here I'm watching. I'm listening to a Joni Mitchell song and it's it's playing the lyrics as I listen to it, which is really cool.  So that's sweet. Free Tune Wiki.  Got a little ads in it. That's that's I guess why it's free.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any way, Gina, to get a feed of the apps that you and Leo have an easy way?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, if it had a screenshot, I just want to feed you just a darn screenshot.  I could take pictures of it. Is there any way we can get a list out?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, not unless we publish one.  I've always felt like there needs to be or there has to be a site where you could just be like, I use this right.  I like GTGT, you know, but for software like these are the things I'm currently using.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there is I use this and there is an iPhone such a thing.  But maybe somebody needs to create one for Android.  And if you know of one, email me. Is it I use this dot com or?  Yeah, that they may have they may have an Android section on it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That might be a good way to say, you know, somebody's made a liar of me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say Tune Wiki is on the iPhone. I don't think that's possible.  It's in the App Store. Well, there you go.  Little did I know. So that's there's a double tip there.  Yeah, and you've seen the layer browser, of course.  You know, I was really surprised.  I think it was a Davos that Marissa Meyer was talking about layer and Eric Schmidt had never heard of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I thought was my in my. Yeah, I was there. Yeah, I was shocked.  So the other moment was Eric barred my phone that he made me download the Skymap thing so he could demonstrate it on my phone because he didn't have it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Skymap's awesome. That's free as his layer layer is a augmented reality browser.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  But, you know, I imagine that would be a fantastic acquisition for Google to put over.  Oh, yeah. Google Maps, Google Street View, all that stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if Eric Schmidt knew about it, maybe they could buy it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, he does now. He does now.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, that's fantastic. And that's that's almost futuristic. That stuff. It's like, how is this? How is this here already?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. It's so cool. So I use this does have Windows, Mac and iPhone, but they don't have an Android page.  So maybe we should talk to them. And Gina, you and I should make a list of of apps because there's new stuff all the time.  There's some great games on there.  There's just some great, you know, great, great applications.  The new Twitter client I'm using just came out from hand mark. I really like is called Tweetcaster.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I saw something about that. I haven't tried it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's quite pretty. Yeah.  And it does seem to have all the functionality that the more mature apps on the iPhone side have.  So it's very it's and it does what I think is really important, which it does notifications.  And you can say just notify me for direct messages or just notify me for all mentions or notify me for all tweets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Have you switched from Twidroid Pro?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I switched from Twidroid Pro to Seesmic briefly and now Seesmic has been updated.  So I have to try Seesmic again.  And then hand Mark said, take a look at Tweetcaster.  And I like this a lot. Jeff, you need to go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You caught the answer. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pizza time. Pizza time. Enough. Enough tools. Enough tips. Enough numbers.  Pete Cashmore. So glad you could have joined us today.  We'd love having you on. Come back. Yep.  Cashmore is, of course, the creator of Mashable. Everybody must must read Mashable daily.  Wonderful. Wonderful. It really is.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Mashable.com. Yep. Of course.  And at Mashable on Twitter and Facebook.com slash Mashable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Excellent. Thank you, Pete. Great to see you again.  Good to see you. Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is the creator of the wonderful Buzz Machine blog at BuzzMachine.com.  You can also hear his letter from the states on the Times.  The Times. Is it Times or Guardian? Guardian. Guardian. Guardian. Guardian. Guardian.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Guardian.co.uk. Media Talk USA.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Media Talk USA. I always think of Alistair Cook's letter from America.  That's right.  That's what I kind of think of you as. A letter from New Jersey.  Yes. Alistair Cook of the Guardian.  Gina Trapani's book is The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But don't buy it right now because I have a new edition coming out in a month.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Watch the Super Bowl ad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're never going to hear an author say this, but I am going to be straight up with you.  No, you're not. That's amazing, Gina. Don't buy my book right now.  Hell has frozen over. I'm coming out with a new edition in just a few weeks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What the heck with you, Gina? I'm buying it now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Buy it twice. It's five fricking bucks.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's six bucks. So you could buy it now. I'd appreciate it.  You could buy me a cup of coffee. But if you want the newest stuff, just wait till March,  South by Southwest. I'm going to have brand new and you'll be in print.  And the two new chapters, chapters nine and 10, are online.  You can check them out right now. And you can tell me what I got wrong.  So please do that. CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really a must-have. You think Wave's going to take off or is it kind of all over for Wave?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wouldn't have written the book if I weren't really bullish about it.  I think that it's going to get adopted. I think it's going to be a power tool for power users.  But yes, I do think it's going to get adopted way more mainstream than it is still.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's putting her word processor where her mouth is.  The new edition out soon. But buy the book now and again later.  So you don't get free updates. If I buy it now, I don't get updates.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're looking at ways that we can do that.  I'd love to be able to stream updates or do upgrade pricing or figure out a way to do that that isn't manual.  So we're kind of trying to work on a workflow to do a software upgrade type thing versus a new edition of the book.  So right now it's kind of up in the air. My official public line is no, you've got to buy the new edition in full.  But we're trying to figure out if we can work out a deal. So we'll see.  That's why I said don't buy it now. It's a technical issue.  It's a technical issue. We're going to see how we can do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina's blog is smarterware.org.  And when do you can I say where you're starting next?
