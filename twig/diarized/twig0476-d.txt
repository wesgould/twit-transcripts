Transcript:  It's time for Twig This Week in Google. This Week everybody's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham is out. She's doing something. She's in Dallas or something.  And then Jeff Jarvis is he still in Milan or he's traveling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe he's in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, he's in London. The good news is we've replaced them with amazing simulations.  Matthew Ingram is here from the Columbia Review of Journalism.  He's their chief digital writer, CJR.org.  Hi, Matthew. Hey. Great to see you.  He's a nice Canadian fellow. So be gentle.  And Mike Elgin is here. He has yet to leave, but he's about to leave for Italy.  So he's still in the Bay Area. Hi, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll be. Hi. I'll be playing Stacey today. My oven is smarter than my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike is at Digital. I always get this wrong.  So gastronomad.net. I always want to say digital. I don't like gastronomad.net.  And Elgin.com. And Elgin.com for Mike's List.  I brought Matthew on because of this article.  Explain yourself, Matthew. Explain yourself in this Columbia Journalism.  Is the podcast bubble bursting?  It was a bubble, actually, wasn't it?  I admit I admire you, Matthew, because a lot of mainstream media coverage of podcasting for the last couple of years acted like it was this brand new thing.  It was just so hot. And that's part of the reason why the bubble burst, right?  Because a lot of people jumped on a bandwagon. You point out that Panoply, which was set up by Slayton, really was a well-known network recently laid off most of its staff.  They're not going to create any new shows, just distribute other people's shows.  And BuzzFeed laid off the staff at its podcasting unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting. BuzzFeed in particular, they said they're going to more like the model they use for TV.  So they're still going to do podcasts, but they're going to mostly use freelancers.  So obviously, I think they wanted to be a bit more flexible, not to get out of podcasting completely.  Panoply clearly just decided the money's in kind of selling picks and shovels, not making the actual content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a play on the old line that the only people that made money during the gold rush in San Francisco was Levi's because they made the jeans for the gold miners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I do think a lot of companies were, let's face it, desperate for new sources of revenue.  Advertising's declining. Podcasts like Serial came along, got a lot of attention.  A lot of companies thought, great, you just stick a mic in front of a couple of guys and boom, you've got a podcast.  It's just that easy.  And as you know, it takes a lot more work than that. It takes a lot more resources.  It takes an investment of time and you have to really think about what you're doing.  And if it's just a kind of side thing you're doing to try and make some extra revenue, it's probably not going to work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also, go ahead.  Well, I was just going to say it's very similar to what happened with blogging because really the people who jumped on the bandwagon didn't really get what it was and didn't understand it.  They overspent, just like in podcasting.  And for example, my favorite definition of a blog comes from Dave Weiner, who said that a blog is the unedited voice of a single person.  Yes, that's nice.  And so all these publication companies emerged with professional editors and all this kind of stuff, which is very expensive.  You need lots of revenue for that sort of thing.  And a podcast, to a certain extent, I don't know if it's the it's certainly not the unedited voice necessarily, but it's something that's more authentic than radio or television.  It's more real.  And the bandwagon jumpers didn't get that.  They did. They did the slick, heavily produced, pretty expensive shows, which then had to be paid for by the tiny number of companies that tend to advertise on podcasts.  And it's just really that's a really tough way to go.  And they didn't have the they didn't, you know, find the pot of gold they're looking for, just like in blogging.  And podcasts will be here forever, despite what Matthew Ingram says.  No, he says it too.  And blogging will be here forever.  It's just it's just not it's not a get rich quick scheme by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You embed a tweet from Rose Eveleth.  I don't know who she is, but she says the BuzzFeed pivot away from podcasts makes sense when you remember that BuzzFeed lives and dies as a business on detailed analytics.  Web content has them. Video has them.  I'm not sure I'd agree with that.  Podcasts still don't.  Is that do you think that that's I don't think that's actually the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it's maybe one of them, especially if you're a company like BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you. Well, that's my problem with companies like BuzzFeed in general.  They're chasing hits or chasing views.  And that means you do it's basically demand media.  You create content because it's going to generate views.  And in my opinion, as a content creator, that's the worst reason to create content.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in fact, one of the one of the things that makes podcasts so I think so successful when they work well is also one of the things that makes them less appealing to companies like BuzzFeed.  And that is it's difficult to sort of browse or snack them in a way you have to really devote some time to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't snack on our stuff.  It's a full meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really require people to invest a certain amount of, you know, attention and time to it.  And that pays off when a podcast does the same when the person who doing it pays attention to, you know, or is really passionate about their topic.  But that makes it less likely to be the kind of thing that a company like BuzzFeed is going to be interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The way that BuzzFeed should do podcast is they should think of it as a kind of source of crowd sourcing, you know, fan feedback, reader feedback.  They should be in a conversation constantly with their readers.  And the goal of it should be both to cement the brand in the minds of their of their biggest fans and also to improve the quality of their journalism.  Because really, that's I mean, you see what happens on Twitter network.  You have all these shows that are all about tech and everybody's learning from all the shows all the time.  And so there's a lot of well informed people talking to you simply because it's a network on the same topic.  So there's a lot of learning, a lot of interaction. That chat room never stops.  There's a lot of information that comes into the chat room and other other sources of media.  And that's really that's really the to me that's the the thing that's so great about podcasting is the it's the interaction with the audience potentially.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you I think if we lump all this stuff in a new media, so blogs, podcasts, YouTube, it does really still seem very early days and it seems like we don't really understand a lot of what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's really interesting is that audio is is the most mobile medium there is by far.  You can you can be running a marathon and consume audio content.  And this is one of the reasons why. Yes, it's not snackable. It's not skimmable.  But at the same time, people have people are doing other things. They're driving. They're doing the dishes, stuff like that.  And so podcasts, audio podcasts can rush into film.  This video podcasts are great, too. But audio podcasts and this is going to have a great future because when we get into the world of smart glasses and bone conduction glasses where you can just stream audio all the time, you can you can the number of opportunities for listening to podcasts will just grow and grow.  So it's it's really a medium that's well audio podcasting is a medium that's well suited for what's coming in the future.  I'm glad to hear you say that.  All you need is one earbud in one ear and you can consume audio podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I mean, smart assistance. I think there's a huge amount of potential for people to, you know, listen to podcasts over their Google Home or started on their phone and continue it on their Google Home or their Alexa.  And I do think in a way you're right, Leo, it is still very early. If you think about it, you know, podcasts haven't been around really that long.  And so I think we're still figuring out what makes a good one and how do kind of audiences engage with it.  And then what does that generate in terms of and obviously you're further along than just about everybody in terms of learning those lessons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would I would say it's more than podcasts, more than new media.  A relevant quote from Kara Swisher's opinion piece about Kevin Systrom leaving Facebook.  She she was of the opinion.  This interesting that this article became an opinion piece in The New York Times.  She's of the opinion that Mark Zuckerberg, the system was an annoyance to Mark Zuckerberg.  He was forced out of Facebook when instead he should have become the next CEO of Facebook because his his depth of knowledge and his understanding he was a perfect CEO, et cetera, et cetera.  But at the very end, she quotes Systrom, the creator of Instagram, saying something that I think could apply to what we were just talking about.  Social media is in a pre Newtonian moment.  Instead of social media, let's say, let's say the Internet is in a pre Newtonian moment.  We all understand that it works, but not how it works.  Just as before Newton, we knew gravity existed.  We just didn't know how it worked.  There are certain rules that govern it and we have to make it our priority to understand the rules or we cannot control it.  I'm not sure I agree with the control it thing.  I think that would be a misguided mission to control it.  But I think it is useful to understand the rules if you want to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you said pre Newtonian, I think you're talking about the Apple Newton or a fig Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, Sir Isaac, I think was the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember reading that quote too and I think he's right.  I think we get so carried away with how much has changed in the last whatever, 10, 15 years.  But really, it's a fraction of a second humanity-wise in terms of since the Internet, let alone since the Web or digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're so immersed in it, it seems like it's always been here.  And we're here, by the way, we have in studio today 47 16 year olds from Australia who are on a field trip to the United States.  Hello kids.  They grew up with this stuff, right?  I mean, it's been their whole lives podcasting from their point of view has probably been there their whole lives.  It's about 14 years old.  So since they were two and certainly the Internet has so it might feel to them as if, oh, man, I mean, what was I don't even know what life was like before the Internet.  But for people an oldster like me, it's pretty I do remember pre Internet days and I don't think we understand it very well.  I do think we're in a pre Newtonian moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think one of the interesting conversations we should be having is instead of saying, oh, my gosh, is podcasting have a future?  What's going to happen podcasting?  I think we should all be talking about why given the existence of podcasting do we need television and radio?  Because they're terror.  They're the whole model of television and radio is based on artificial scarcity and all these other barriers that sort of enrich the controllers of those things.  Everything should be a podcast.  Everything.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or YouTube.  I'll bet you you guys probably don't watch TV very much.  You probably watch a lot of YouTube, though, right?  Yeah, they're nodding.  I know even with my older kids, my son is 23.  YouTube is the source for everything for him.  He wanted to learn how to cook.  He watched YouTube videos.  Yeah, my daughter's the same.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who needs knowledge?  Certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that does raise another issue, which is it's these these part of the reason we like them is just as you were describing Mike, they're they're unfiltered, unedited.  They're very personal.  They're very passionate.  But they are.  But they and there's no gatekeeper.  And often wrong.  And but for that reason, you know, unlike the and we have this argument with Jeff all the time because Jeff Jarvis will blow out gaskets.  They will.  You couldn't trust the you know, how could you?  Where are you saying you could trust the New York Times 20 years ago?  It's just it appeared to be trustworthy.  There appeared because there were gatekeepers.  There appeared to be some.  There were more filters.  There are more filters.  Doesn't mean it wasn't wrong from time to time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think there's and Jeff and I have talked about this, too.  There's there isn't just the occasional wacko who has a YouTube channel peddling conspiracy theories.  There's also YouTube, the engine, the algorithmic driven recommendation engine that is feeding those videos to users, to audiences.  And that's an element that we haven't had before, one that we don't really understand very well, I don't think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would I would quibble a little bit with Kevin Systrom about the need to control it.  But it's true that what we don't understand is how it works.  I mean, and when you look at something like Twitter, which kind of like many social sites descended into a dumpster fire, how do you keep social sites from doing that?  We don't really understand very much of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think if you if you think about Twitter or even Facebook, for that matter, there's literally nothing that has ever existed in history that is like that.  So there's nothing that has ever connected that many people in that way.  So there is no like metaphor.  You can say, oh, well, people didn't trust newspapers or people didn't trust TV anchors.  Well, that's really not comparable.  There's never been a network that connected two billion people on a daily basis.  There's never been the ability to share your thoughts instantaneously with potentially hundreds of millions of people.  And we just don't know how to behave like how that works.  So you post something on Twitter. Is that like you publishing it in a newspaper article or is it like you stapling something to a telephone pole or is it like you standing in a park or a public square yelling?  It's like all of those things.  All of the above, yeah.  And also things that we don't even understand yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there's also this the truth about Twitter is very solipsistic that it's a bunch of journalists on Twitter.  How many of you young people use Twitter?  How many of you so about not many?  How about Facebook? How many of you are on Facebook?  Little more.  How about Snapchat?  How many of you are almost all of you?  Instagram?  Instagram?  Yeah, that's the most right.  So that's the other thing is Twitter gets, I think, a disproportionate amount of attention, especially in the news.  Agreed. Yeah, agreed.  It's not really it's it's a it's a it's a you know, a small selecting tiny report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's but but but you know, this is the interesting thing about Twitter is, you know, that's not an inconsequential demographic.  All the journalists.  And, you know, journalists get enormous amounts of stories and interaction and stuff like that from Twitter.  So really, I see Twitter, you know, if I'm going to pick a metaphor from that's off of Matthew's list, it's almost like an adjunct to the world of journalism to a certain extent.  I mean, you were talking about sources, right?  You're talking on Twitter, making the observation that everybody's like, oh, my gosh, you know, President Trump is so fantastic at using Twitter.  He's he like uses Twitter to know he uses Twitter to play the media like a fiddle.  And if you look at it, well, right.  But if you look at actual tweets during the during the election, it seemed to be all Trump all the time.  Other politicians, including Barack Obama and others, were getting far more retweets, far more engagement, far more comments than Trump's tweets.  But the media was picking up on those highly newsworthy, crazy tweets from Trump.  And every day he was using Twitter to get in The New York Times to get in all these other publications.  So really, Twitter, I think the biggest impact is its total access to all almost all journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it the case, though, that all of this handwringing over Facebook and Twitter only started when Trump won the election that before then?  Yeah.  But and I would submit that and this is what we're talking about on Twitter, Mike.  I know you sounds like you listen is I would submit that the that that's because he he he figured out how to use both to great effect.  He's a troll. He's a troll.  He's been a troll for years.  You can label it with a name.  But but I mean, the fact of the matter is he or that guy, Pascal, or whatever, he figured out how to how to use it better than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's interesting if you look at this is something I think about often when it comes to Facebook and how to use it.  Barack Obama's campaign, there were a number of really laudatory articles written about how how well they were using digital media, in particular Facebook, and how they had figured out how to kind of mobilize their followers by using Facebook and so on.  Had all these digital smart guys figuring it out.  And then and it was all very positive.  And then as soon as Trump and the right wing did exactly the same thing, it became hugely negative.  It wasn't exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it was different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but but but but to be fair, what Obama did in 2008 was create a great digital group that understood these things.  They collected a lot of numbers.  I know they got mine because they said they want updates or whatever.  And then they were able to use those numbers and those Facebook accounts in 2012 in the in the in the reelection effectively.  But even what they did was targeting.  They used targeting.  But what they did was nothing compared with what Brad Parscale and the Trump team did.  I mean, the biggest difference is that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then and then the biggest difference is that Obama organized self-selected supporters.  That's right.  Voluntarily.  That's right.  To be part of this.  Brilliantly.  And what the Trump campaign did was they used targeting to to manipulate people who never even had any idea they were involved in anybody's political campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you could say and I'm not sure if this is true, but we're looking into it.  There is an interesting correlation between the Russian activities on Facebook, which which very closely mirrored Trump's own strategies down to the state and localities.  Whether there was communication between the two or not is yet to be determined.  But maybe just the Russians are smart enough to see what what Trump was going for and to support it.  But but it wasn't Trump's campaign by itself.  He got a lot of help.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we're still debating how much how much of an effect that had on the election.  Did it actually influence the outcome?  This is something that even sociologists and experts in this type of stuff are are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, though, Matthew, seems like the needle's moving more in the direction of it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I thought so, too.  There was one particular academic whose name escapes me now who just came out with a book.  Yes, that's who we're talking about.  He believes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That it actually did tip things over.  So I've spoken to several sociologists who study this area and they disagree.  They don't think that there is as much evidence.  But obviously, there's still a debate.  The big question is, did it see it push people in a new direction or did it just sort of reinforce things that they were already thinking or planning to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it takes it takes a village to lose an election.  Somebody who ran for president recently.  And, you know, and we're talking we're not talking about whether the needle moves nationwide.  There was no way Trump was ever going to California.  We're talking about a couple of states, three states.  That's how you win.  You do it. You use the college to your advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And with an 80,000 vote margin, he was able to win.  Those things were failed to go and press on those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She didn't do a good job.  It was a combination of of both of those things.  And so, you know, it's hard.  You know, at the end of the day, it's hard to lay blame.  Even if you have not lame blame at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only bring this up in the context of if somebody does, if we get into that post-Newtonian movement moment, when somebody writes the, you know, the Principia social network.  And maybe it's Brad Parscale.  That's going to be a scary moment because I think actually we might be seeing that moment where where people have figured out here's how you use the Internet to to sway opinion to.  I mean, it's not just elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biggest problem is not the persuasion of people in one political direction or another.  The thing that the Soviet Union that KGB discovered during the Soviet Union was disinformation, which is this where we get the word disinformation.  The goal is not to persuade about something or another.  The goal is to to reduce and eliminate trust in any source of information.  And so nobody knows what's true.  Everybody's like, well, who knows?  And that's that's the thing that's being exported by Putin, former KGB officer.  And the thing that kind of Trump is kind of picking up on as well.  It works to if you if you can get everybody both fearful and also confused about what's true, you can you can do all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually I remember reading Facebook even before kind of the election.  And there was all the attention on the Russian Internet Research Agency.  Facebook had an internal security report in which they discussed the actions of what appeared to be government actors or government influence actors.  And they didn't specifically say Russia, which caused a bunch of controversy in the head of security left partly as a result.  But in the report, I remember them mentioning that it was interesting to see how much of the activity wasn't actually designed to be ideologically balanced in one way or the other ideologically sort of rigged to right or left.  It was simply designed to confuse people and get them doubting even their own senses, doubting what was true, doubting who to believe.  And, you know, that that was enough to kind of just create chaos and kind of get people paralyzed with indecision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think the most interesting fact about this, which is underappreciated, is the fact that the Russian trolls actually organized street marches successfully in the United States.  People are marching in the street. Amazing. Because Putin organized those protests.  Yeah, truly. It's astonishing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram is here from the Columbia Journalism Review. And this all started because you said the bubble had burst in podcasting. You see what Matthew you see? You see what you've done?  You never should have said it.  No, no, I completely agree. In fact, I've been hoping the bubble would burst. It's been awfully crowded in here.  It is a bubble burst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to buy my tulip bulbs in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, Mike Elgin, he's at Elgin.com.  There's a lot to talk about. In fact, let's when we come back, do the Google change log.  And you guys are all going to get up and walk out on me when? Soon?  No? Oh, shoot.  255. Okay. Remind me to say something nasty about Australia at 254.  And then we can stage the greatest walkout. It'd be such a great moment.  I might even you might even get on Twitter if we do this right, kids.  It's called disinformation. Disinformatio.  Do.co slash twig. Digital Ocean. And I am such a fan of Digital Ocean.  Digital Ocean makes it the is easily the easiest cloud platform you can use.  If you're a developer, if you're setting up a web service, application service of any kind,  you can deploy, manage and scale applications so easily on Digital Ocean.  And I love it. They call them droplets.  Droplets are scalable. Virtual machines.  With that on storage, you can add storage, you can add security, you can add monitoring capabilities, you can add backup.  You could choose from standard or CPUs, optimize droplets and customize from there.  You get an easy to use control panel, an API that lets you spend more time coding, less time managing infrastructure,  access to the compute resources you need at the lowest rates.  In fact, I can't believe I've been running. I've been running a blog on there for like five bucks a month.  I love it because once I create a droplet in Digital Ocean, I can use my SSH public key to log in.  So it's very secure. They've really done a nice job of locking it down.  Ninety nine point nine nine percent uptime and it's an SLA.  So they guarantee it. Cloud firewalls, monitoring and alerting, full DNS management, global data centers, enterprise SSDs.  And as I mentioned, that easy to use API.  So let's let's let me think of an example we can do with this here.  Let's say you're a 16 year old in Australia and you like to write Python code and you have this great idea for an online game that you'd like to create.  That sounds good, right? And maybe maybe you'd like to do it for a couple of bucks.  You don't have a lot of money, right? But you want to do a proof of concept.  And what if it became popular? What you'd like to be able to scale it up?  Let's create a new droplet. Show you how easy this is.  You see, by the way, with create, I can also add a lot of other things. Cloud firewalls, floating IPs, load balancers, all sorts of stuff.  Spaces is for storing and serving static assets. So if you had it, you could have as use a space for an image.  Now, a couple of ways to do this. I can choose from Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CentOS.  But really, maybe I want to use a container distribution or how about a one click app?  Discourse, Doku, Lamp. Let's set up a Lamp stack or a MySQL stack. Ruby on Rails, WordPress, GitLab, PHP MyAdmin.  You want to use Python? Let's use Django, right? That's the Python framework.  So I'm going to click on Django. Now I have to choose the droplet size.  Everything from $5 a month, one gigabyte memory, one virtual CPU, 25 gigabytes space and a terabyte.  That's actually quite a bit of storage. You can even pay for a backup if you want automatically.  20% of the droplet price. That's like a buck. Block storage. Let's pass on that.  Now, where's your server? Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, Bangalore.  Let's do, I always choose San Francisco too. I like to add my SSH key to it. That way I can log in.  And let's name this Leo's Django. So now this is going to be the Django framework running.  Now let's see how long it takes to set Leo's Django up. Basically, I'm provisioning a server that I can use,  that I can write code on, that can post code on. It's public if I want it to be.  I can add resources. If I write the ultimate tool, I can say, hey, it's a huge success.  Yes, I spelled Django wrong. DJANOG. It's Leo's JANOG.  Within a couple of minutes.

Stacey and Jeff have the week off, but you know what doesn't get the week off ever?  The Google changelog.  We brought this back for the 20th anniversary of Google.  Are you laughing? I love the drums.  Yeah, yeah. Some user, somebody made that for me some time ago.  20 years of Google. They celebrated their anniversary.  It's unclear when exactly Google's actual anniversary is.  Sometime in September, probably, there's when Google, you know, first incorporated.  There's when, you know, there's various dates in here.  Google has, here's some of the numbers over 20 years.  Google Maps has helped people find their way with driving directions in 240 plus countries spanning 40 million miles of road, 83 plus trips to the moon and back.  Connecting people to 150 million places around the world.  Google Assistant now in 20 languages.  Translate lets you say thank you across 100 languages.  So did you guys from Australia, did you use translate when you got here so that people would understand?  Yeah.  143 billion words a day translated.  Is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It always blows me away when I see these stats from Google and Facebook and companies like that.  Just the volume of traffic they can handle.  Half a billion people use Google Photos every month.  More than 1.2 billion photos and videos a day.  Photos is freed up 410 petabytes worth of space on people's phones.  Auto complete and search estimates people's, as they estimate people save 200 years of typing a day.  200 years of typing a day with auto complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it forces them to correct the word duck all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what you mean.  1 billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I almost never want to say duck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You must have said duck once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why your Google Assistant got a makeover this week.  I don't know if you saw it on the phones.  Didn't we talk about this last week? I feel like we talked. We didn't.  So this is the new look of the Google Assistant.  It's a lot better, isn't it?  Bigger visuals, new controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's more compatible with two coming devices.  One of which is the Pixel 3, which has a wireless dock that holds the phone up at a viewing angle.  And so it looks like the Pixel 3 will be usable in its dock as a smart display.  And then of course the Google Smart Display, which is forthcoming.  It's basically a Google Home device with a screen.  And so they're adding visual elements and touch screen elements to the Assistant  and moving away from just text question, text answer.  So it's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I quickly want to buy Leo.Page.  But I'm sure it's already too late.  That's the new top level domain from Google Registry.Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure Larry.Page is taken.  Larry's got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does Ellen.  Ellen.Page.  Home.Page.  ChristopherNeman.Page.  Web.Page.  I see all the good pages are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turn the page.  Word as image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo.Page looks available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do I get it?  Quick, quick.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Registry.  Oh, I know there's people out there doing it right now.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're interested in Registry, follow Registry.  Oh, I have to go through somebody.  Oh, man.  Oh, forget it.  I have lost it already.  Dang it.  Why did I?  I wasn't thinking.  They also have .how and .I don't understand Japanese.  I don't know what that means.  What is that?  Anybody speak Japanese?  What does that mean?  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone.  That's awesome.  Everyone's got that page.  How do I type that in, though?  Try your best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have to put that on my business card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can do it.  Yeah.  I'm putting that on my business card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm putting that on my business card.  I'm putting that on my business card.  I can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm putting that on my business card.  Leo.squiggles.  Leo.everyone.  How do you say it?  What's Leo doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minna.  Minna.  It's Japanese.  Minna.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that, but I think I'll take Page instead if you don't mind.  I'm going to miss out on Page.  Can we hold the release of this podcast for an extra hour while I...  Too late.  We do it live.  There is a new mini in town.  Looks like a mint.  It's a new Aqua Google Home Mini.  How exciting is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, I didn't say it would all be good.  It's just new stuff from Google.  New Android app.  Yeah, it actually might be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Google Home thing might connect to a greater hub that controls the home and stuff like that.  It could be the beginning.  Does anybody remember Android Home or something like that?  Google five years ago introduced this new home operating system.  What?  Yeah, at Google I.O., Android at Home or something like that.  And then it just fizzled and went away and nobody ever heard from it again.  But they were demoing stuff and pretty amazing.  I didn't last very long.  I think they're finally getting around to the new home.  They're getting around to that.  And they have to to compete with Amazon, which definitely wants to control your home.  But yeah, we'll see.  I think it's going to be a lot more capable than the current one.  It's going to look exactly the same, but it's going to be much more capable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a software platform or is it a hardware platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's similar, except it's going to support both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  It seems like the addition of Bluetooth is going to be really interesting for the platform because it's like, what are they connecting to right now?  We really don't know.  But it's you know, we're what a week away from finding out.  So it should be it should be.  Yeah, it should be cool.  I think I think that product is going to surprise people quite a bit.  I just don't know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will be streaming the event.  It starts 8 a.m. Pacific, 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, October 9th.  And we hope to learn some very interesting things.  Certainly new Pixel phone.  And you said there'll be a new charging stand or holding a grasping stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a it's a cradle for wireless charging.  That how do you know about your there's a leaked renders from that they're going to show at the at the event on the 9th.  And they got out there.  They look perfectly legitimate.  But it's basically a round disk plugs in with probably USB-C at the bottom.  And then it holds the phone at sort of an angle.  Yeah.  And so it looks cool.  And again, I think I think they're really shooting for expanding the usage of the of the smart display by actually turning Google phones into a smart display.  And hopefully you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I got a charger for my phone that would do that, that would hold it up at an angle like that specifically because I wanted to see it.  It actually just rotates photos.  But still, it's another display you could use for different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The reports on this one are that there's going to be a completely different display for when it's in that mode.  So when you're like in your own smart is probably very similar to the to the Google smart display product that they're going to be announcing.  It'll essentially probably be a Google smart display.  So it's just completely convert over to that when you plug it into this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I've just been trying to register Leo dot page.  I would keep talking.  How's it going?  Well, I went to Google domains and said, you can't do that till October 9th.  So this is going to be a big day.  Can you can you grab Jimmy dot page?  We did see I did get an email because I'm a Google Fi customer saying that pre orders will begin immediately after the event for whatever it is that.  Nice.  So I presumably that's the Pixel 3 that they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm torn because I really want an Apple watch, but I would rather have the Pixel 3.  So I'm kind of on the fence right now, whether I go with the watch or the Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For people who were hoping to keep their old pixel alive.  Good news.  Google has launched a repair service for older pixels.  This is from Android police.  Eventually, we'll cover all four pixel phones.  That's a good thing, because basically if you have one of the old pixels, good luck trying to get it fixed.  Yeah, that's good.  You know, that's that's showing some some I think some corporate responsibility.  It's really a shame when you get these things and they just after two years are obsolete and you can't get them fixed and you have to throw them out and they're perfectly good.  They just want to sell new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bought my Pixel Pixelbook at Best Buy and I was kind of in a rush and I went to buy it and I'm like, oh, I'll I'll go sign up for the Google Care, whatever it's called later.  And then when I went to sign up for it, they're like, nope, you can only get that if you buy it from the Google Google directly.  And so now I have this Pixelbook that's really you know, I got the high end one, so it's pretty expensive.  And I have no coverage.  To the best of my knowledge, there's no plan to repair it, I guess, other than bringing it back to Best Buy, which is like, wow, not sure I want to do that.  So they really need to get their act together if they're going to compete in any way against Apple, because Apple's just everybody knows you can just take it to the near your friendly neighborhood Apple store, go to the Genius Bar.  They'll probably fix it.  They're, you know, Apple's light years ahead of Google on on on and it's not about the repairs as much as it is about getting people to purchase in the first place, the knowledge that they're going to have this, this this service is going to really facilitate people buying pixels, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you used the new Google Maps with the special commute tab enabled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I work from home so.  There's no tab for your your cross cross home commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if yeah, I don't really have much of a commute either.  But what's really good and this is something I'm really glad they added you can do mixed mode commute so you could drive walk and take mass transit.  And it will put them all together for you, which is great, including a arrival time based on on all three of those.  So that's coming Google Maps and iOS and Android in any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pay attention to which mode you're in, because I had an experience where I got directions when we were in Italy and almost drove down a staircase because I was in walk mode as opposed to driving mode.  Probably a marble staircase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that what happened in the Italian?  In Italy you're allowed to do that.  I think.  No, you are.  No, I saw the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I it's not just Google.  Nobody's offering the dot page domain until October 9th.  But hey, thank you.  Go daddy.  I can pre register it at Go Daddy, which they said increases my chance, maximizing my chance of getting it for a meal.  Six hundred sixty nine dollars and ninety.  That seems worth it.  If I want priority pre registration, which lines up ahead of everyone waiting for general availability and increases my chance of getting this domain, it's a mere eight hundred nineteen dollars.  Wow.  Nine cents.  So thank you.  Go daddy.  I think Google said we're going to charge twelve dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's why you you won't actually find Leo dot page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I'll never find it because somebody will pay hundred dollars to get it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd pay that much for Larry dot page.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you bet.  You better think Larry's got that locked in.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did Ellen Page get it?  How do these?  You got to know somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She pays somebody to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what this means, but I like the name.  Reimagining the commercial break with advanced TV solutions.  Right.  What could possibly be wrong with that?  This is Google ad manager delivering seamless experiences and all screens dynamic ad insertion.  What?  Everybody wants this smarter TV ad breaks optimize your commercial breaks for the highest revenue based on the most relevant combinations of ads customized for each viewer.  Well, how would they customize them for me?  How do they know what I want to see?  How do they know what I want to see?  Oh, they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I love about about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, on one hand, they say, you know, we respect your privacy.  And then the hand, if you go to the ad blogs, this, hey, you want to know what that guy did with his credit card the other day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We could tell you that we respect your privacy because that's our whole business plan is selling your privacy.  That's why we respect it.  Yeah.  So this is a I see this as a trend that is mostly associated with Amazon.  So, for example, Amazon was the alternative to brick and mortar stores.  And now they're talking about launching thousands of brick and mortar stores.  Everybody's confused.  Wait, I thought they were the anti brick and mortar.  But that's never been the case.  What Amazon represents is commerce that's algorithmically driven, that's, you know, has all this tracking, all this kind of stuff.  This is another example of that.  I thought YouTube was the anti TV.  No, not really.  It's basically algorithmically driven, customized advertising.  Theoretically, I actually think Google is not very good at producing customized ads, not as good as Facebook has become recently.  But I think we're going to see Google breaking into TV in one way or another.  And, you know, there are already everybody's TV set under the age of whatever it is, 20.  And so it's really not about TV versus online.  It's really about is it are you just sending out mass ads to everybody advertising beer and tires for the sports fans and et cetera?  Or are you customizing based on purchase history, web activity and all that kind of stuff?  And that's the business they're in.  It doesn't matter if it's TV or not.  So I think we're going to see a lot of that where these algorithmically generated, you know, that live and die by algorithms are going to break into, I guess, the real world or the analog world, whatever you want to call it in any way they can, because that's really their model is to is to to use algorithms and tracking and personalization to sell more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my only fear is that this future will be much like the web is now for me, where I go to a site and it says, Would you like to buy the pair of shoes that you just finished buying?  Yeah, I love those recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, does it all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the things I just literally just bought it.  No, I don't need another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read that book already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I'm confused about and maybe maybe somebody has a handle on this.  The best contextual advertising by far is on Instagram.  I literally want every single thing they advertise to me.  Is that amazing?  And there's no other site that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All these kids are nodding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many of you have bought something on an Instagram ad?  And I should hold up both hands.  I used to.  I took Instagram off my phone.  I just deactivated my account.  I used to wake up in the middle of the night and I'd be bored.  I'd flip through Instagram.  Invariably, I'd buy something at three in the morning.  Invariably.  Yeah.  The underwear I'm wearing right now, I bought on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to say that?  Why did you get rid of your account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why.  Why did I get rid of it?  Because I was waking up at 3 a.m.  Going on Instagram and buying crap.  It's like worse than the home shopping channel.  So is that or hitting the ice cream?  Or impulse control.  Well, I guess you could say it's my fault.  Or you could say, as Mike just did, they really nailed the algorithm.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they are pretty good at it.  I have to say.  Have you ever bought anything on Instagram?  I have come close.  But every time before I do, I do a Google search for whoever's selling it.  And in almost every case, it looks like it wouldn't be a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, that's the thing.  It works on the phone.  You're not likely to do anything.  And then the other thing that they've really made too easy is between Apple Pay and Amazon Pay.  I don't have to fill out a credit card.  I just press a button and it's on its way.  Yeah.  Right.  I've said this for so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did something really weird.  I'm sorry to step over you, Matthew.  I did something really weird, which I think says a lot about online commerce.  So I saw this really cool thing on Instagram.  I had to have it.  It was basically this orange.  You've probably seen it too.  It's this orange hockey puck thing that gives you a Wi-Fi hotspot.  I bought it.  Yeah.  Well, you shouldn't have because it's like a form of showrooming, except there's no showroom involved at all.  So I went to Amazon to check the reviews because where else are you going to get reviews that are that clear and that numerous?  So I went to Amazon, read the reviews and decided not to buy it, which I think is a really interesting phenomenon.  Amazon reviews are actually a really good guide for certain products about whether or not you should buy them because not only you can go straight to the one star reviews and find out what the...  And if you see a common thread, oh, this really...  Everybody was saying, oh, it slows way down after a trivial amount of traffic.  It slows way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what's wrong with it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And 100 people said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And recommendation-wise, I think Amazon's recommendations are probably the best I've ever seen and have been for a long time.  Not just people who bought this also bought this, but things that it recommends based on your browsing history, they're almost always things I'm either interested in buying or thinking about buying or like they're just extremely good at that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually like this Skyrim Solus, but yeah, the 500 megabyte...  Do you use it?  It was too late.  I'd already bought it.  Yeah, we just used it on our last trip and that's where the 500 megabyte limit, daily limit really bit us.  We paid 99 bucks.  You can have five devices connected because it's Wi-Fi.  We carry it around as we'd walk around.  But I think it's less necessary now because of Google Fi and T-Mobile.  We got just as fast on our phones and we could hotspot them and we already had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, my carrier has a Rome-like home thing.  So you pay 10 bucks a day.  Yep.  You're basically using your account like you were at home.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in a way, I mean, I think this was a good idea, but I think the times have changed, alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  It is interesting though.  I wonder whether Instagram, are they better at feeding you things that you are actually interested in because it's specifically image-based?  You're literally just scrolling through images and liking things and that I think provides a huge amount of kind of data on what visually being attracted to.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's not forget, every, what is it, eighth post is an ad.  But all the posts in between are often ads.  Did you read this article in today's New York Times?  A penthouse made for Instagram.  $15,000 a month in New York City, 2400 square feet, free of the clutter of everyday life.  Because no one lives there.  Instagram influencers rent it by the day.  It's booked through the month of October already to post pictures.  So here's the bedroom, by the way, furniture from Wayfair.  And here's an Instagram post from an Instagram influencer advertising apparently her bra.  Recently I discovered, be tempted bras.  I haven't been happier.  This is an Instagram post.  This should be illegal.  Well, it does say ad in there, but I mean, there are more ads on Instagram than their regular posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talk about advertiser supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a piece recently, I can't remember who did it, but it was all about kids basically having a summer job that just consists of posting sponsored content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want to be a real Instagram influencer, have a baby.  That's really useful.  Yeah, it helps.  It really helps.  Cheryl Lee Lyle, Soho, Manhattan, selling.  What do you think she's selling there? Cupcakes.  Nope. That's what I thought.  It's that soft Roma t-shirt or sweatshirt she's wearing.  More on my cozy new sweatshirt and this adorable interior by Wayfair on my stories now.  It doesn't say ad.  Oh, does it not say ad?  Uh oh, she's in trouble with the FTC.  They're coming for you, Cheryl.  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this penthouse thing is a mirror of a company that's existed in Russia for a while since at least a year, which will rent a private jet so you can take pictures of yourself on a private jet.  It never leaves the tarmac.  It just sits there.  I think Dan Bilzerian uses that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's...  Yeah, he probably does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's always going somewhere in his private jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But something occurred, something disturbing occurred to me about Instagram influencers.  They often mock everyday situations even though they're staged.  So for example, one common theme of a lot of influencers is they show them getting up in the morning or going to bed at night, especially getting up in the morning.  But they get up in the morning, their makeup is on, their hair is done, they look perfect, the whole room is perfect, everything's wonderful.  How is this different from the King of France at Versailles who staged a going to bed and getting up ceremony every day and all the sycophants would gather around?  And then after everybody would tiptoe away, they'd go into their real bedroom and actually go to bed.  He would have loved Instagram.  He would have loved Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What an influencer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He would have killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apres moi l'Instagram.  So the one thing I missed on Instagram, speaking of these staged things, is Kirby Jenner.  This is actually a very funny comic who poses as the fraternal twin of Kendall Jenner.  He'll take Kendall Jenner's real pictures and Photoshop him into them in hysterical ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't.  He's not in this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He just he gets dressed up to match.  Nice.  Yeah.  So it actually this is a really great send up of everything that's wrong with Instagram.  So that's a real Kirby Jenner post with him added.  And I'm sorry if you're listening and you're not seeing these pictures, but just do me a favor.  Follow him on Instagram.  Kirby Jenner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was quite a disturbing piece actually earlier this year about a girl who basically lives her life for Instagram.  I think she's she was 18 at the time, I think, and not really, you know, nobody famous.  But but her parents were wealthy enough that she went to some pretty good parties, I guess.  And she she got marketers interested in kind of promoting their products through her Instagram.  And she it was kind of depressing in a way because she she had no real life.  Her entire life consisted of kind of faking a life in order to promote products on Instagram.  I mean, where is she now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to wonder, you know, this poor girl, her values have been completely warped.  Right.  Can you go back three?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which one would you like?  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One more.  OK, look, that's a sleeve.  Look at how long his sleeve is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, Whoa, I won the award for longest sleeves at this Met Jingle Ball thing.  And this is a real big moment for me.  Shout out to Reggie at Men's Warehouse for hooking it up.  Like always, my Uber driver for her patients and Janet, the caterer who fed me snacks all night because I can't wait to get home.  Right.  Because I couldn't find my own hands.  That's a great look.  So this is the real Kendall Jenner at the Met Ball Met Gala with him.  But he spent some I mean, he doesn't do a whole lot of posts because it takes forever.  He's got to get the outfit.  He's got to.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here's a video.  Kylie said, If this video gets over 50 million views, she'll let me have my garage sale at her house.  Kirby.  Kyle.  He is, I think, the most talented person I have ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly the most talented of all the Kardashians.  He's the best Kardashian.  Oh, he is?  Yeah. Yeah, he's definitely the best.  All right.  We hadn't finished the Google change, but we got really distracted here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have one more thing that you're going to very much like.  And I bet you all of the young people here in the audience will be excited about this.  Do you like Assassin's Creed?  Fun game, right?  Can you imagine?  You know, your school stuck you with Chromebooks.  You can't play any games.  But wait, Google Project Stream is bringing Assassin's Creed Odyssey to your Chrome browser.  Oh, but wait, I'm sorry, the fine print.  Your Internet connection has to be capable of 25 megabits a second.  You must be 17 years or older and live in the U.S. to participate.  Oh, cool, though.  In your browser.  Yeah.  This is really, I mean, it makes sense.  They're accepting.  You know, you have to get an invite.  You could apply on the website right now if you if you meet all those criteria.  You know, 25 megabits isn't that much nowadays.  I think there's a lot of people with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be interested to see how this works, like in real.  Real life, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm looking at the sign up.  They don't say specifically what kind of hardware you need.  But I'm thinking this is you got to have a Pixelbook or you're using Chrome on a fairly heavy PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm totally doing this.  Isn't that awesome?  I got a Pixelbook.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Assassin's Creed Odyssey.  I think by the end of the October 9th announcement, everybody's going to think that Pixelbooks  and high end Chromebooks are like the most capable devices.  I believe the Windows 10 rumors, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rumor is there'll be a tablet.  I think a fairly good rumor.  Kevin Toffle was talking about this from AboutChromebooks.com last week.  Fairly good rumor that there will be a new tablet called Codename Nocturne or Pixel Slate  that doesn't have a keyboard but has their third party keyboards like the Bridge.  That's how we learned about it.  A keyboard that can be attached to it.  It'll be a fairly high resolution 3x2 screen running Android.  And that's the rumor that's most interesting that may also run Windows 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The good money is on the idea that this Nocturne tablet will get it immediately or soon enough.  And that the Pixelbook could get it immediately.  And it's only a matter of time, you know, six months or whatever, where there'll be a half a dozen to a dozen.  Devices that will run this, the Windows 10.  So pretty cool.  Are you at all worried about the idea of a tablet version of Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or does that sound good to you?  Because I've only seen one.  It was from Acer and it was unimpressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that the Pixelbook folds into a tablet,  but it's irritating to use because the back is a keyboard.  And even though the keyboard is disabled in the tablet mode,  it's still super annoying to use it with a keyboard in the back.  And so a tablet mode is going to need an entirely different interface.  I've used my Pixelbook a lot in tablet mode and just, you know,  just tapping around and using touch for the browser and stuff like that does not work.  A lot of missed pokes.  And so they really have to change the interface and I hope they do.  Essentially, when you put any Chrome Chrome or Chrome OS device into tablet mode,  or if it's a tablet, it should just kick into a completely different interface  that's a lot more like iOS or Android interface.  So I think it's a great idea.  It's a great device.  Right now, Google does some things that are interesting.  For example, there are certain things that you need a keyboard to do.  And as soon as you put it in tablet mode,  those things go down and become selectable on the bottom display thing.  They just need to do a lot more of that kind of thing in order to make it viable.  But I think it's doable and I think it would be great if they could do that.  Because again, you know, you add a Bluetooth keyboard to a tablet.  That's how I have used my iPad since 2010.  It's great to have a separate, completely separate keyboard from a tablet that's a dedicated tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but is it covered in leather?  I hope so.  Did you see this? The HP Spectre Folio, the first laptop.  This isn't a leather case, a leather cover.  This is actually a leather laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leather laptop for you leather enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want leather, you've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason I thought of this is because it does have a kind of a keyboard that does not detach,  but it has a kind of a convertible.  And you can see as it floats down, there's one position where the trackpad is still accessible.  I'm not sure exactly what the idea there is, but it's really cool.  And it's running Windows 10.  Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that because this has been the extended edition of the Google Change Log.  Yeah, thank you very much.  Thank you. Thank you very much.

California has enacted a net neutrality law joining a number of other states.  It seemed like, you know, when I read it, it seemed like, you know, not a big deal.  The net neutrality law basically reinstates the old FCC rule that internet service providers can't block sites, slow down sites, can't zero rate sites.  In other words, let some sites be free on their service while others are not.  Immediately, the Department of Justice sued and many other ISPs because apparently, despite the fact that the FCC says we don't need this regulation because nobody really wants to do this, everybody wants to do it.  I mean, isn't this an admission basically by the United States government that the whole point of eliminating net neutrality so that internet service providers could slow down sites, block sites and zero rate sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty much.  The Justice Department wants to basically rule that it's unconstitutional for a state to regulate interstate commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually in the Constitution that the federal government regulates interstate commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. The problem with that line of argument has been tested in court before.  And what was determined in the existing precedent is that, in fact, states can do that.  The reason they can do that is because the Ajit Pai FCC, in their reversal of the Obama era ruling for net neutrality, essentially argued that the internet should not be or will not be regulated by the federal government and therefore, private companies can do pretty much whatever they want.  And so what is likely to happen, according to legal experts, is that when this goes into court, they're saying, no, you guys rule that you cannot regulate this stuff.  So if you can't regulate it, then you can't tell states they can't regulate it and therefore states are allowed to regulate it.  And this is going to happen.  I think that California's net neutrality law is going to prevail in court and it'll be another shining example of competence and so on by the current FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope you're right. I understand the constitutional objection, but the California legislators who created this law say we specifically wrote a law that would not infringe on the Constitution.  I think you made an excellent point. The federal government has already said we're not going to regulate it.  So how could this be competing with the federal government?  And when I read what this law does, I wonder how an internet service provider or the Department of Justice, all of whom are suing the state, explain the fact that they've said, well, we don't want to do this.  They're trying to preserve the right to do this.  The new California law prohibits.  See, what do you think about this?  You think it should be against the law for internet service providers to block or throttle lawful traffic?  Should it be against the law for them to require fees from websites or online services like Twitter to deliver or prioritize traffic to consumers?  Should ISPs be allowed to zero rate?  Should they be allowed to evade net neutrality protections by slowing down traffic at network interconnect points?  All of this seems sensible.  No, they shouldn't be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But part of their argument is that they need to do some of those things or want to in certain cases.  So throttling, for example, for network congestion purposes.  So their argument would be, yes, we don't want to throttle all of this company's traffic.  But we might want to do what they call in Canada bandwidth shaping for specific purposes.  And that might be misconstrued as I'm not I'm not saying I agree with this argument, but I think that's part of what the reason they're complaining is that they feel it would this would criminalize things that they already do.  Lots of lots of companies criminalize things they already do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The trouble is that it's much more complicated because really from the ISPs point of view, there are two Internet's.  There's the Internet that goes from the world to the ISP and then the Internet that goes from the ISP to the customer of the ISP.  And if you're throttling that the latter one, the connection to the customer based on if you're prioritizing different services based on any deals you made or whether you happen to own those sources of information, then that is clearly a violation.  That's akin to a company building a toll road and then blocking traffic on the actual road and routing different people for different reasons and so on.  Clearly a violation.  However, there are certain things like, you know, huge percentage of the Internet's traffic is Netflix and YouTube.  And so there's all kinds of things that they have to do between Netflix and YouTube to give prior prioritization.  Huge investment.  YouTube and Netflix pay a lot to the ISPs for some of this activity.  And that's an entirely different kettle of fish.  Peering agreement.  Desirable for exactly.  Peering agreements, et cetera.  And so it's very, very complicated.  But it's essentially what we have here is a conflict between a state administration, the Jerry Brown administration, which is acting on behalf of consumers and enacting a clear consumer protection bill and the FCC, which is acting clearly against consumers in favor of companies.  And this is essentially how Washington tends to work anyway.  And it couldn't be more clear cut in that regard.  I mean, the devil is in the details and the California bill is not perfect.  But this is what we're talking about.  Does freedom mean that consumers have the freedom to get unbiased access to everything on the Internet or does freedom mean that Comcast has the right to charge and nickel and dime and throttle and play games with the consumer in order to make more money?  How do you define freedom?  It's clear how the FCC defines it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Department of Justice does not always win.  According to Reuters, the U.S., which is trying to force Facebook to wiretap messenger calls in their investigation of the Fresno MS-13 gang, has failed.  The proceedings were sealed.  So we only know that the judge at the U.S. District Court of Fresno ruled in Facebook's favor.  It said Facebook does not have to decrypt those messages.  We don't know why.  But Reuters has two people briefed on the sealed ruling, which who are saying that Facebook, in fact, has won this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is whenever they every every generation has its its unassailable bad bad people, whether a few years ago as Al Qaeda.  It's always child pornographers.  Now, MS-13 is something everybody's afraid of.  And the typical playbook is that you law enforcement or some other government agency wants to be able to do certain things.  And judges or some other group in the government says, no, you can't do that because of annoying things like the Constitution or the existing statutes.  And then they always come back with, oh, but the, you know, child pornography, we have to stop the, you know, whatever it is that nobody could argue is a good thing to stop.  MS-13 in this case, you always have to be everybody should be wary of these examples because they're all they will always come back with that that example, that reason why they need to do something generally that they've always wanted to do.  And it's a great way to get voters to the polls is to scare them.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  That's why that's why what's his name?  This book is called Fear.  What's a Bob Woodward's book?  The reason it's called Fear is that it's based on this idea, this political idea that scaring the daylights out of everybody gets you a lot of power.  And so lots and lots.  I wrote a piece on this.  I call it the Fear Industrial Complex.  And, you know, lots and lots of different companies have discovered if you can get make people scared enough, they will they will give you either power or money or both.  And so, yeah, that's that's essentially the sign of the times we need to learn to to recognize those things when they're coming at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Hitler used it's been used time in memorial to create a scapegoat and make people scared of them and then say, well, I have the solution.  Only I can solve this problem.  What's changed is the ability of people to as we began the conversation to use modern technologies, Internet technologies to spread this.  And we can really we could scare people really good now.  Yeah, we got it down, man.  We could terrify you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just my mother-in-law got a phone call out of the blue that said, oh, we've we've recognized that you're so and so activity.  We're going to be we're going to be coming to your place of business or your your home to forfeit.  You're going to have to forfeit your home and all this kind of stuff and just scare the daylights out of her.  I mean, and I looked it up and did some research and it turns out that this is a scam that starts in India.  They they tunnel into like a US VoIP and then they make phone calls and leave messages.  And it's just like there's no attempt to persuade or con or trick.  It's just like scare people and the money flows.  And it's just a really awful thing that that, you know, they're essentially trolling for people like my mother-in-law who don't really understand what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Works better with older people. That's for sure.  Yeah. Now that I'm an older person, I'm getting a lot more.  I was I was happy to think last week when the new iPhone came out, I got a call during all the shows.  They call me total of 14 times in one day saying your iCloud account has been hacked.  This is hi, this is Olivia from Apple's Apple support.  Your iCloud account has been hacked.  I got a call from a robot call.  Please call us at this number and whatever you do, don't use any Apple services until you do.  Right. Of course, immediately I went to iCloud to see if I've been hacked and I hadn't.  But, you know, you know, those things are scams almost immediately.  It doesn't. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. I know my friend, her mother was on the way when she called her.  She was on her way to the bank to take money out, to send a money order to someone who claimed that her network had been hacked.  This was the only way to get she was literally on the way to the bank to take money out to give to some complete stranger.  And if her daughter hadn't called, you know, she probably would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know for a fact, and maybe this is something I don't know a lot of people have talked about, but that all of these scammers, all these call are coming from Australia.  This is actually Australia.  Many people don't know this. You know, they go to Russians, but it's Australia.  They're all coming. The worst.  It's it's up up. They're going to leave.  I think we have to play them a special song as they thank you.  Thank you, young people.  Play the song out. Will you Karsten as as the procession that the land down under.  It.  Australia's let us rejoice.  But we are young and free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've golden soil and wealth for toil.  Our home is Gert.  I see what else Gert Gert.  You don't see that word a lot anymore.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  So long.  Catch you later, mate.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, we're the.  Staring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, you know, it'd be a great idea for a podcast because I know you don't have enough podcasts to deal with.  A podcast that focuses on scams that identifies as a major scam and then follows through on it like the podcast.  Like, where does this come from? Who's doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Interact with the Nigerian like scammer and like, you know, go back and forth with them and like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the next serial because you do every, you know, if you did the Nigerian, what do they call it?  The four four four scam or whatever.  If you did that, yeah, yeah.  If you did it, it would take a long period of time because, you know, you have to write and they write.  Really?  Next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll talk to the comedian who does that.  No, who responds to it's fantastic.  There's a whole there's a whole routine where he basically responds to a Nigerian scammer and pretends to be interested and then asks for photos of him and his family.  And it's quite funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There used to be a website full of things like that where people would say, well, we need you to prove that you're legit.  So we want you to put a fish on your head and stand on one foot.  Okay, I'll do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope that those nice children from Australia who are going home are not going to go through New Zealand because a new law has been passed in New Zealand went into effect.  October 1st, the Customs and Excise Act allows New Zealand customs to carry out digital strip searches.  They previously customs in New Zealand could stop anyone at the border and demand to see their electronic devices.  The updated law says travelers must provide the password, the pin code, the fingerprint to unlock that device or be subject to a fine up to $5,000 and the device will be seized and forensically searched anyway.  The New Zealand customs spokesperson Terry Brown said it's a file by file search on your phone.  We're not going into the cloud.  We'll examine your phone while it's in flight mode.  And basically that says, so if you're a bad guy, just store everything in Google Docs in the cloud.  Yeah. Yeah. And you're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, which is why they'll amend the rule in like a year to include the cloud and social networks.  You have to provide your social networking passwords, etc.  It's a slippery slope for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're worried about. I assumed that ICE and, you know, Border Patrol were doing this, not New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you never know where it's coming from.  And maybe they'll say, oh, that's a good idea.  You know, I do know that the FBI actually is getting now its routine and warrants.  And it's recently happened in an FBI search warrant, the right to hold the phone up to a perpetrator's face to unlock it.  Oh, really? Interesting.  The FBI was able to force a suspect to unlock his Apple iPhone 10 with his face.  And it is apparently being written into search warrants on a regular basis now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as far as I understand the legal precedent so far, they can compel you to do things that involve using your body.  So your fingerprint, your eye scan, your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yes, because for years, they've been able to take a fingerprint or take care for DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're not allowed. They're not allowed to force you to reveal a code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's the contents of your brain.  Of your brain. Exactly.  Because it's speech.  All of this relies on courts that continue to uphold that principle.  And there is absolutely no guarantee that that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and the advice that I've read is, yes, technically you can say court president doesn't give you the right to force me to reveal a code.  And they can say, fine, you can sit in the slammer for a couple of weeks.  You get to sit in airplane jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe me, airport jail is the worst jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to be in airport jail.  I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is one of the things I love about a Chromebook is you just power wash it and there's literally nothing on the device.  Nothing that can be even extracted from the hard drive and so on.  But there are a lot of these things that changes in what happens as you travel around the world in terms of your security and privacy.  A lot of things are like stories like New Zealand.  And in almost every case, I'm like, well, that's an interesting story.  As a journalist, I need to cover that, be aware of that.  But for me personally, traveling, it doesn't bother me at all.  Because you're an old white man.  Yeah, exactly.  You're a turban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See what happens, Mike.  OK, right.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's a story that came out today that actually did freak me out.  And that story is that a German man was detained in Turkey for defaming Erdogan on social media years ago.  I have personally defamed Erdogan myself.  And the Cuban government and lots of you know, you name it.  So I'm thinking this is the first time I've ever thought, you know what?  What do I need to solve?  I'm just going to delete all my old posts because at some point this thing is going to snowball to the point where I'm not going to get into some of these countries anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first thing before I deactivated my Twitter account, that's the first thing I did is I ran a script that deleted all my old tweets, every one of them.  Fantastic.  And I think that that's probably a good idea, although tweets live forever, regardless of what you might do.  They do.  There's plenty of they're stored in lots of places.  But yeah, I agree with you.  I think this is this is not this is a point.  But I would stay out of Turkey.  You know, we were in Italy, Mike.  There were you couldn't move in Amalfi or Positano.  It was jammed with tourists.  Of course, it's high season in September.  But our guide said it's gotten much worse because people aren't going to Turkey and Egypt.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is why the places like Italy and Provence are getting so crowded in Barcelona, because the number of places that people, the tourists want to go is narrowing.  There's one idea that I think is kind of an interesting idea that I think Matt Drudge either see the Drudge report on Twitter or Matt Drudge on Twitter.  They post one tweet, they delete.  There's always one tweet there.  And when they do a new tweet, they delete the existing tweet and then tweet another one.  So you can go to the site.  I think it's Matt Drudge.  Always exactly one tweet.  And that sounds like a good idea to me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, you know, you know, you can it may not be on Twitter, but it's still there.  I mean, I deactivate my account, but it doesn't mean it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I've thought about going, you know, crossing the border to get into the U.S.  And having someone check my Twitter feed or and see things that I've said about Donald Trump and decide that, you know, I'm not welcome in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's always Lindsay Lohan who could punch you in the airport in France.  So it might.  Apparently she might.  Apparently, apparently will.  Yeah, I have not had any.  Well, you know, we we traveled.  We travel a lot.  I have never had problems coming in the United States, more trouble going into Canada than ever getting in the United States because I'm a U.S. citizen.  But the Canadians are tough.  You guys, you guys are tough, but fair tough.  You don't want to mess with a Mountie.  I'm telling you, those guys, they're scared.  Did I ever tell you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did I tell you about coming back from San Francisco and going through Canadian customs in Pearson and this large, you know, Marine looking guy with haircut and weapons and whatnot was very serious.  And he said, are you Matthew Ingram?  And I was like, I'm pretty sure I am.  Yeah.  But why?  And he said, like, is that Matthew Ingram?  And I'm like, am I on a list or something?  The one T Matthew Ingram?  And he said, are you on that show with Leo Laporte this week in Google?  And I'm like, yeah, I said, I love that show.  I love that show.  Yeah.  And then we had this great chat about whatever we were discussing that week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always very aware of the fact that we have listeners in every walk.  And that's why I really try to be fair.  I'm sure that was a was a guy, a security guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he said, I have some different views when it comes to like encryption and, you know,  I can understand that.  They're right on the front line there.  You should like totally get in the chat room or something, because we would love to hear from you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and I always ask law enforcement when they come in.  We get a lot of law enforcement visiting.  And I always ask them and they often do come down on the other side.  But then remember, they're on the front lines and they're looking for every tool they can get.  But it isn't. But I think most of them understand that is a natural tension between the need to police and the right to freedom.  That's why we have a constitution.  And that's, you know, I mean, a lot of the things in the Constitution make it harder for police.  Privacy makes it harder for police.  You know, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, these all make it harder.  And they're intended to because we don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, luckily, we don't have any of that in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I always think that if the United States enacted Canada's immigration rules, it would be such a scandal.  Canada, it's like you pretty much like they're much heavy, much more heavily into what we would call an H1B visa type of situation.  You have to come in with skills and all that kind of stuff.  Or the U.S. kind of works against that partly because the corporate powers that have influence in Washington want lots and lots and lots of cheap workers.  And so they're not they're not looking for competitors.  They're looking for consumers, workers.  And so but but if like, let's say, President Trump suddenly enacted Canada's law to the letter, it would be the most outrageous scandal imaginable.  We'll be running in the streets. Oh, my God.  They're just, you know, elitist, blah, blah, blah.  Mexico, too. You know, all of our neighbors have this rational policy of saying, you know what?  We we could really use more doctors.  And so we'll prioritize professionals in one way or another.  So I just think it's kind of an interesting thing that people, your average American would assume.  Oh, yeah. Canada's probably got a really sort of liberal policy on immigration.  Nope. On refugees, yes, but not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure. Well, Canada did, though.  Remember, I know Matthew knows this, but there was a why it was very wide open and when was it the 70s?  And it was a lot of people came to Canada.  And it's a wonderfully diverse nation because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say, you know, we have had problems for sure.  And I would never claim that Canada was some kind of utopian society.  But nothing gets me thinking about how well things work here as a multicultural society like going to the U.S.  I mean, there's just things you take for granted in a place like Toronto or Vancouver or even Ottawa.  It's the way culture works, different people speaking different languages, doing different things.  It's so wonderful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wonderful when you go to Toronto. Toronto has two Chinatowns.  Yeah, and they're both excellent. They're both excellent.  I mean, it's just wonderful, the diversity there.  And when I worked at Rogers, you know, the staff was incredibly diverse, partly because we were in the Ethnics Channel building  and they broadcast newscasts like 50 different languages.  But it's really a model of what could happen.  It's a shame that it's become less open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things that I like to say to confuse and enrage Canadians is that Canada is like the United States,  but the United States is nothing like Canada, by which I mean that there are many pockets of the United States  that are a lot like Canada in every way, including diversity.  I went to the most diverse university in the world, which is UCLA.  And it was fantastic because of the diversity.  There are parts of the Northeast, you know, New York is a wonderful example of great diversity.  So a lot of the cultural elements that you find in Canada, you'll also find in the United States.  However, you won't find a Texas in Canada. You won't find a South.  You won't find, you know, so there's the problem with absolutely everything in the United States  besides extremism in every direction is that the lack of evenly distributed culture, of laws, of norms, and etc.  So it's interesting. And I don't know what this has to do with Google, but it is interesting.  Yeah, Google is going to help. We do have a Texas. It's called Alberta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. Actually, there are Texas's. Cowboys, oil, and beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Texas is a friend of mine. Alberta is no Texas, I tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a nicer version of Texas. When we went into Barcelona, I was just blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess it's probably because we were affluent white people coming from the United States.  But remember that once you're in Barcelona, you go anywhere in Europe without any customs controls.  As long as you have any port of entry in the EU. Basically, they barely looked at us.  Yeah. I mean, they didn't look at our bags. They didn't look at anything. They barely looked at the passports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very unnerving. That's the best part about going to Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I go anywhere now. I'm in Europe. I'm going. So I says hello. You show them your passport.  Yeah, it was it was almost as easy getting back in the US. Frankly, it wasn't.  In fact, you know, Johnny Jed, our travel guys always say you got to get global entry, Leo.  You got to get global entry. Really speeded up the line for global entry.  When we got off the plane and JFK was around the block, we just walked right up, showed him our passport, walked right in.  It was everybody's got global entry now. So the smart thing to do is not have it.  That's what I think anyway. Here is an interesting story about Burger King and their new ads created by artificial intelligence.  I don't think they actually were, although some people might consider ad agencies artificially intelligent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gender reveal bad tender reveal. Yum. It is a boy bird with crispy chicken tenders from Burger Thing like a lavender.  But minus one math is tasty tender plus sauce equals romantic dinner. Eat the math. Pick two of these for six money bucks.  BK logo appears. I like it. Yeah, it's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So natural and authentic Burger King and oppressively says the video is the work of a new deep learning algorithm.  But an article from Ad Age says humans. Yeah, obviously. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you seen there's a there's a guy on Twitter who constantly posts I made an artificial intelligence algorithm watch, you know, 100 episodes of Seinfeld and then it wrote one.  Yeah. Wow. Different things. Is it? And they're they're hilarious. But they're jokes. I mean, he he makes them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so this is after this is an Olive Garden commercial after. Yeah, that's a that's a really is this after watching Seinfeld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, so he made it watch a whole bunch of Olive Garden commercial. A group of friends laughs at a dinner table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, click the first one. There you go. A group of friends laughs at the dinner table. A waitress comes to deliver what could be considered food waitress pasta nachos for you.  We see the pasta nachos. They're warm and they're warm and defeated. Friend one. The menu is here. Waitress lasagna wings with extra Italy.  We see the lasagna wings. There's more Italy than necessary. Friend two. I shall eat Italian citizens. Waitress unlimited stick.  We see the unlimited stick. It is infinite. It is all. Yeah, they are warm and defeated.  Friend three. Leave without me. I'm home. Waitress gluten classico from the kitchen. We see the gluten classico.  We believe the waitress that it is from the kitchen. We have no reason not to believe. Friend four says nothing.  Friend one. What is wrong? Friend four. Friend four says nothing. Friend two. Friend four. What is wrong?  Friend four. Friend four smiles wide. Her mouth is full of secret soup. Olive Garden. When you're here, you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're here, says the wet voice announcer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're a great parody of sort of bad artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this to be clear, he's writing these. This isn't really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think what this represents and the Burger King thing represents is the creeping realization that things that are presented as AI are not very smart by how we consider smartness.  You know, in fact, human intelligence is quite an amazing thing that we are years and years and years from replicating in any convincing way.  I mean, best example I've ever seen is that the day after Bill Cosby was handcuffed and hauled off to prison, Twitter recommended that I follow him on Twitter.  Oh, my God. I don't think he'll be tweeting a lot.  He's not going to be tweeting a lot.  And for them to realize that it's come to the conclusion that I wanted to follow Bill Cosby because I mentioned him.  I made some crack about Jell-O pudding or something like that.  And now all of a sudden...  You should follow him. He's funny.  If a person recommended that, I would say, you're an idiot.  You're taking the drinks from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, though, that that article points out that it's it's become part of marketing that you want to pretend that artificial intelligence is involved because it makes you sound really smart or that what you're doing is really.  And yet, do you remember when Facebook came out with what was it called?  Am or something? It was its assistant that was going to help you.  Yeah, it became racist.  And they pretended that it was AI, even though it was human beings.  Like they actually wanted.  Yeah, this is what happened with a lot of companies are doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think this is this is the big lesson for AI.  I'm sorry. Sorry to cut you off, Matthew.  There are a lot of anytime somebody comes out with AI that has human assistance, their intention is to say, OK, when there is a mistake, when there's when the computers can't figure something out, we have this team that will figure it out.  And they will also train the algorithm so that over time will gradually phase out the humans.  They've tried this with M. As you mentioned, there's a great AI calendar scheduling meeting app called Amy from a I know it's a X.A.I.  I believe is a company. Oh, yeah. And and they I'm pretty sure they're still using human assistance.  The biggest area of this is driverless cars.  What we were told was that they're developing these driverless cars and then they'll just will turn them loose on the highways and they'll just flawlessly drive around.  What they've come to to realize, though, is that all of these exact actual examples of self-driving cars like in Arizona and so on, they have a NASA like control room of people who are monitoring everything and who can remotely take control.  And and because because A.I. just cannot function like a human can, as Jeff would say, full stop.  And so this idea that you're going to have control rooms of humans monitoring self-driving cars is going to be here for decades, I think.  And if you look at some of the in Silicon Valley, some of the self-driving delivery systems, those are heavily monitored remotely.  The little the little ice cooler that goes down the sidewalk, completely monitored by a control room.  And so the idea that A.I. is anywhere near being able to just function on its own without human input is a delusion.  This is not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would argue that this also extends to social media.  I mean, if you look at the problems that Facebook in particular has had and Twitter, for that matter, trying to algorithmically or through machine learning recognize trolls or spam or harassment.  It's it's there are nuances of human behavior that even some human beings aren't that great at recognizing, let alone being able to train an algorithm to do it and that you just cannot do it at the kind of scale that Facebook is trying to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the most frustrating things about Zuckerberg's testimony in front of that Senate hearing was that one of the only satisfying answers that he gave was that, oh, we're on the brink of developing A.I.  That we'll just handle this in real time.  And everybody's like, great.  That's fantastic.  In fact, that was the worst possible scenario.  Essentially, Facebook is saying that we kind of view A.I. as this rug where we can sweep under which we can sweep these things that we have to eventually apologize for.  It'll all happen behind the scenes.  If we are deleting false positives because our algorithm falsely thinks they're fake news, no one will ever know because it's instantaneous in real time.  And so that really bothered me that the A.I. is going to handle it is not a good answer to any of these problems.  It's the perfect answer because it's the perfect because, A, a lot of people go, oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And B, if it fails, who gets the blame?  You don't know.  Right. Right.  It's a perfect answer.  This guy's no fool.  By the way, that that Olive Garden parody is written by comedian Keaton Patty.  You could follow him on Twitter at K.E.A.A. K.E.A.T. O.N.P.A.T.T.I.  And I, for one, what lasagna wings with more Italy than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think warm and defeated makes a nice showtime.  Warm and defeated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see the pasta nachos pasta nachos.  They're warm and defeated.  Speaking of defeated, a sad day coming our way.  March 2019, GeoCities will pass into Internet history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a GeoCities page.  Did you really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  I'm trying to think.  I don't think I ever did.  Yeah.  The Internet in 1990s was filled to the brim.  Filled to the brim, writes CNET with flashy text art, pixelated graphics, neon colors and broken HTML.  Those were simpler times.  My best discovery in this article.  Yeah. Right.  And then the mailbox it opens and closes.  The best discovery here is the tumble log.  One terabyte of kilobyte age photo op.  Nice.  Sounds like a title written frankly by AI.  But it's full of GeoCities pages.  Nice.  I don't know if you can you still go to the Turkish Angora Breeders Union page?  No.  Who owns?  I guess Yahoo.  Yahoo Japan.  Yahoo Japan owns?  Oh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one.  Something's wrong with this one.  Physician assisted suicide.  There is a page.  That's a good looking page.  What's really good about this site is they're all rendered in 1990s era Internet Explorer.  Yeah.  Really authentic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the most shocking things about this GeoCities news is that Yahoo bought it in 1999 for $3.6 billion.  What?  Unheard of back then for a price like that.  That's just an outrageous amount for back then.  I mean back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was actually, if I remember, Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, I think, famous VC who's invested in all sorts of startups.  GeoCities was one of his first big payoffs.  Oh really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He took the money and run.  That was a ton of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where can I find stupid money like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was going to be the new AOL.  With Yahoo gone, it's really harder to find that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ironically, the idea behind GeoCities is actually quite forward thinking.  It's like an open thing where people can post their own.  It's a combination of social networking, blogging, essentially, and also building a website.  It was like WordPress and Tumblr.  If you were to hear a description of that and say that this was something that was available in the 90s, you'd think, wow, they were way ahead of their time.  But now it's just viewed as the opposite of ahead of their time.  So Yahoo sort of killed that and Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really some good work by Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo Japan is different than the other Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tumblr's going to be killed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not killed so much as, in fact, I've actually been spending more time on there.  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is owned by Verizon now, right?  This is part of the Oath family of companies.  Yeah.  I wonder what Verizon has in mind for Tumblr because Tumblr is a pretty much Wild West part of the net, right?  Yeah.  It's great software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is part of what I like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's wonderful software.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also the sort of I know there's a lot of porn and so on, but there's also there's a lot of people who, you know, I don't think would fit anywhere else.  There's a lot of art.  There's a lot of just odd people with things they're interested in.  I find that type of stuff fascinating.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's an easy way to make a blog.  And it's kind of the original concept of a blog, which is a stream of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also like as my daughters started using it and they they almost exclusively consumed media in the form of animated gifts from anime TV shows.  So literally that was 98 percent of their media consumption at one point, which I just found fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a very prime Tumblr address, which I constantly got emails people wanted it, which is leo.tumblr.com.  But I killed it.  So if somebody's been looking for that, go ahead and get it.  You know what?  I don't I don't think I didn't really need to kill Tumblr really.  But getting off Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook was also was part of a larger thing like stop stop looking at news like Apple News and Microsoft News.  Stop stop watching cable news to the degree that I can.  I mean, I got to keep up on what's going on.  But yeah, that all that stuff was not helping my mental state.  And now I've noticed a really and I wonder if maybe it's just people I know, but a really negative trend.  It's mostly young people.  I should ask these Australians before they left.  I notice it because I no longer looking at these things.  People instead of conversation will show you stuff from the like hold up memes like your dinner and they go, look at that instead of conversing.  Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've actually done that.  I mean, I do it with my daughters.  Did you see this on Instagram?  It's actually I'm maybe I'm too deep into it, but I actually find it.  It starts conversation.  It is.  Sure it does.  And it is it is me trying to communicate with them in a way that they feel comfortable.  Yeah, I guess if I had younger kids, I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now because I don't see Instagram or Facebook or anything, I kind of want to almost shield my eyes like, no, no, don't show me that.  I have actually been trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been trying to do less.  I mean, I have to be on Twitter for my job.  I have to read the news.  I have to know what's going on and what people are talking about.  But I I agree with you that I don't think it's fundamentally a healthy way to live all the time.  And so I'm going to scale it back to the point where I do other things outside of kind of work or I try and put a limit on it and then go and look at funny cat videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you could make the case that that's all that this network is is us finding stuff to show people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see this is in a way it is in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The world needs to be shown things.  I don't think that podcasts are addictive, though.  I don't think I've ever heard anybody say that the problem with social media is that it's designed and increasingly evolving to become more distracting and addictive and gobble up more and more over time.  Whereas I think podcasts galbals up more of your time because there's lots of information and stories and stuff like that.  Anyway, I'm the biggest podcast fan in the universe for promoting podcasts.  Yes. But I've been doing it for I've been the biggest podcast fan in the world for a long, long time.  But one of the things that is interesting and I think is the best tip I can give people for avoiding the kinds of problems you're talking about is to to not consume the things that you're talking about.  The feed that you get you have to.  So I have two Twitter accounts.  One is for incoming and one is for outgoing.  So my Galgan is where I connect to people that I know that I connect to people that are interesting that I I connect for all the normal reasons you connect.  But I 99 percent of the time I don't look at that the stream.  I have another stream which is cherry picked for news for specific types of information that I like to get from Twitter.  And it's completely devoid of rancor of BS of the kind of politics I have.  I use a lot of mute words, unmuted words features, so I don't have to hear about the political stuff of the moment.  And so I have one for input and one for output.  I have one for output.  Every once in a while, I'll look at the output for the Mike out of an account.  But I recommend that it's not being on social media.  It's consuming social media as a source of information.  It's good for outgoing.  It's not good for incoming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I spent a lot of time trying to come up with sort of ways of correcting that problem.  So Twitter lists is one way.  And I I'd never actually look at my stream.  I only look at lists.  And so that's theoretically it kind of focuses the stream on specific topics, although Trump infects everything eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I do exactly what you do, Mike, because of you, actually.  I killed my outbound account completely.  But I have a links for Twitter account that is just news.  It's a great source of news.  Yeah, I don't.  Well, I don't consider a source for news, but I realize that the feed reader is kind of dead.  RSS is kind of dead.  Twitter has kind of supplanted it.  And the one thing I find Twitter very useful for is like hot breaking news.  So if if I hear a rumor, some celebrities passed away or there was a big earthquake or something like that, that seems to me better.  The fastest way to get that at least get the shape of that information, if not accurate news about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They used to say journalism was the first rough draft of history.  And I think Twitter, in a way, has taken over that even rougher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, much rougher.  Well, one of the things I did with my my incoming account is called the new news.  And I've been using it as an incoming source of news for a long time.  But a few months ago, I turned it into a breaking news feature.  Now, just retweet the very most breaking news.  This isn't an ad. I don't care if people follow it or not.  It's just something that I do impulsively because I got to, you know, I got to share certain types of information.  So it's political tech, stuff like that.  And I just reshare it because it's so easy to do.  But one of the things that I add to my feed, in addition to sources that I add people who are super good at retweeting and the best retweeter on the Internet, I guarantee you, is Matthew Ingram.  Really?  So, yeah, if you follow one person on Twitter, follow Matthew, because you like you like retweet the best content.  And it's like it's like if you get like, you know, most people are retweeting.  Like you get you look at your stream and you're like, why am I getting that on my stream?  And then you realize somebody, you know, somebody's retweeting.  Somebody I followed for tech is retweeting Sportsball.  And I'm like, oh, my God, I don't want that in my.  But but yeah, Matthew Ingram is like the guy to follow because you just have.  And this is this goes back to what a newspaper is.  You have intelligent journalists who are curating sources of information and information itself for you.  And that's really what you everybody should be looking for on social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is like the old days of Twitter five, six years ago, where there were people.  Unless those days. Yeah, who were who was the guy?  It was great. He became the Twitter journalist.  He used it exclusively. Andy Carvin, Andy Carvin.  And it was great. You could follow Andy and you knew that you were going to.  Yeah. What is he still? Yeah, he's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's teaching actually at UBC. He made that his full time job at one point.  He did. Yeah. He was at NPR originally, I think.  And then, yeah, he started reportedly, which was effectively a journalistic enterprise devoted to just doing that.  And it was brilliant. And then the Omidyar Network stopped funding it.  And then he moved to the now this. Yeah, his his work was seminal in terms of using social media properly for journalism and turning.  I interviewed him a number of times about it.  And he said he he looked at it as Twitter was effectively his newsroom.  He did crowdsourcing journalism that was just unparalleled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the guy to read during the Arab Spring. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Another brilliant example is Nick Bilton for his wonderful book, Hatching Twitter.  He has all these very sort of storytelling approaches to things.  Oh, it was a beautiful sunny day in Sunnyvale in 2000, October, whatever, 2006.  And he got all the information by going back in Twitter and seeing what people are posting.  He got little details about what people were wearing and what kind of muffin they got at Starbucks and like all this kind of detail because people post that kind of stuff.  And he was able to go back and use it as a sort of historic snapshot of what individual specific people were saying and doing and thinking and feeling and et cetera.  And so as a journalistic storytelling research, if you're if you're telling history, it's a it's a wonderful it's wonderful because of course, you know, you can search and find all those details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of retweeting, I actually remember, believe it or not, in the early, early days.  Remember when retweeting was like brand new and you would type the letters RT or the yeah, there was no facility to do it.  I had a friend who got really, really mad at me for retweeting.  He was like, why are you doing that? You should be posting your own thoughts.  You shouldn't just be retweeting other people.  And I was like, OK, I mean, sure, I have my own thoughts.  That's one point of view.  And I want to like tear them on by he just was outraged that this was not how you should be using Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really a shame. Those of us who've been with Twitter for a long time to have watched its rise and fall, I think.  I think back every time I see a hashtag and you see them all.  I mean, Google's event coming up on Tuesday is hashtag made by Google.  I think about Chris Messina, who invented it.  And it was just kind of, you know, I know, Chris, you know, you're just kind of a nice guy.  And he just said, you know, it'd be kind of cool if you put a hashtag in front of something and be like a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, he got that from IRC, I think.  Did he? Yep. Yep. Hashtags were already in use.  They were already in use. OK. You just used the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's it's and then what Twitter was smart because they took these ideas that were really homegrown and they incorporated them into the system.  Yeah, I mentioned. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love how Instagram lets you follow a hashtag and it just shuffles it into your stream.  That's new. And I do like that feature. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is kind of in a way, Twitter is like a live sort of research lab into what into the kind of downsides and upsides of just mass kind of real time communication, social communication.  It's it's like a conversation with millions of people, all of whom have different kind of competing agendas, some of whom are mentally disturbed.  And I mean, it just it's a system of home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about Kanye, you're talking about Kanye West now, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's he's pretty good at getting attention for himself on Twitter as well.  I think a little bit. Yeah, I think Twitter is the is like a narcissist dream.  And I think that narcissists make the best trolls.  But Trump is the point. Exactly. Exactly.  I think that to me personally, I I like Twitter a lot.  I would and I've been harping on this for years and years, especially on the show.  They just need to make one change. Let me delete other people's comments to my tweet.  And then I can start conversations and I can moderate those conversations.  And then I beyond that, I don't need any other censorship or filtering or anything.  Just let me start conversations and let them not be hijacked by people who are out to disrupt conversations.  And that's it. That's all they have to do. It would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is pretty unprecedented that you can be sort of having a conversation with people.  And some rando can just, you know, from across the world can kind of jump into your conversation and torpedo the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what happens is like I'm harping away at the president all the time.  And and sometimes you hit a nerve, you put on some list.  And so it's distributed to all the trolls. They all come after you.  And it's just, you know, my my my comments for you, my at mentions, looking at, you know, people that at mentioning me just becomes unusable.  For like a month because it's just flooded with Russian bots and all this garbage.  And I just would love some control over that. And I really don't need any additional filtering beyond that.  I think Twitter's fine the way it is, except for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's some our last story. It's a very good news.  Twitter has finally allowed you to opt out of curated timelines and go back to the chronological tweet.  They phased him out two years ago.  Hallelujah. Yeah.  Go into the settings and I don't know. Have you guys done it yet? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did actually. And this might seem like heresy.  You like the curated.  So I've been trying to spend less time on Twitter.  And I actually find the when I come back, stuff you might have missed the stuff you missed is actually helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't care about stuff. I miss honestly.  I would like to miss more. I would like to miss more stuff.  I'm worried about missing things. It bugs the hell on me when I see a two day old tweet at the top of my.  Really? Yes. Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm I'm of two minds about it.  Like I said, if I if I was on it all the time, like I used to be, then I would have definitely much more preferred the chronological.  But I do find it useful to get kind of I'm actually looking at Twitter discover or whatever it's called now,  which I never used to do because it also used to be filled with garbage.  But just to try and find out, you know, is there a Twitter moment about something that's going on that's interesting?  Is there something is there a conversation going on somewhere that I should know about?  Because I am trying to dip in and out more often instead of just having it on all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that continually comes up for me when we talk about Twitter is why do we let this company take something that is really potentially of a lot of value?  Why do we let them be in charge of this?  Why don't seriously why don't why don't all the journalists, all the people who are good and interesting on Twitter, why don't why don't they do something different?  Why don't they go somewhere? Why doesn't somebody create something?  Because Twitter is the worst possible steward of this thing that is valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But people have created things and no one goes.  No, I used mastodon briefly.  I know. Yeah, mastodon. What's the other one? App.net.  That's gone.  That was going to be paid for. And mastodon is great, but there's nobody there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem. And that's why everybody who does good content on Twitter should move to mastodon.  And then we could finally leave this hellhole behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just need to convince people to do it somehow.  Yeah, people are sheep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, I tried to get everybody to go to Google Plus and nobody listened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember that.  I went. I was there.  Thank you. You gave it a try.  Network effects are the most powerful human phenomenon imaginable.  Like Twitter should have failed so many times because its infrastructure was terrible.  The company management was ridiculous.  It's one of the probably worst managed companies in history.  And yet it became this massive success because it was so compelling to use and addicting.  And people just couldn't help themselves no matter how.  Remember how people used to complain, damn, this network goes down all the time.  And they would complain on Twitter about how painful it was to use Twitter.  And then they would just come back and keep doing it.  They could not fail.  They tried so many times to fail and they failed to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook too, though.  I mean, Facebook, how many times have they apologized for this, that and the other thing?  And the list of failed ideas that they came out with, mostly copying other companies just blatantly.  Some of the things that they copied from Snapchat and other places have actually succeeded for them.  But for the most part, it's been one failure after another.  But those network effects, everybody's on Facebook.  That's why you go to Facebook.  It's not because Facebook is such a great company.  They're terrible stewards again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's like a cockroach.  And actually, I know my daughter, my youngest daughter, deleted her account on Facebook.  And then eventually she was forced to sign up again because everyone was there.  All her family members, all her extended family.  There was no way to know what was going on or to see the photos of the baby or the wedding or whatever.  So she was basically sucked back into it in the same way we all have to use email, even though we don't like it.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we were talking on Sunday about Google's 20th anniversary and what did we use before Google?  And there's a lot of speculation.  Thanks to Jessica Condit, we now know.  Three dead search engines remembering dog pile, ask Jeeves and Alta Vista.  We all agree.  She forgot a few.  Alta Vista was actually pretty good.  She wasn't even born practically.  But what about Excite?  Right. There were a few others.  But this is the factoid or fact, actually, I loved from her article.  The first use of the word Google as a transitive verb on American television was in 2002.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And of course, Jessica would know this fourth episode of the seventh and final season.  Jessica's going to be on Twitter on Sunday, right?  That's fascinating.  Buffy, Willow, Xander and the gang.  Sounds like one of Brett Kavanaugh's parties.  Buffy, Willow, Xander and the gang are trying to help Cassie, a high school student who's cryptically saying she's going to die next week in Buffy's dining room.  They searched through hard copies of Cassie's medical records and find nothing noteworthy.  Willow tapping away on a thick white iBook.  It turns to Buffy and says iBook.  Have you Googled her yet?  Xander replies jokingly, Willow, she's 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's amazing.  You know, another example of the power of Google emerged today or recently.  We've all heard about the New York Times expose on the Trump empire and Fred Trump and the family and the real estate deals.  Donald Trump was a millionaire by age eight.  He was making $200,000 a year by the time he was three.  All this kind of stuff.  That entire investigative report began with a Google search.  What?  And they talked about the Google search in the article or in one of the follow up articles where there was this, they had this odd phrase that Fred Trump, Donald Trump's father, used for recycling money back to the kids or something like that.  It's called, I don't know, something mortgage was like a preemptive mortgage or I don't know, some weird phrase that is not used by anybody else.  And they simply searched Google for that phrase and the word Trump.  And they found some documents and they're like, wait a minute, this document appears.  And they started pulling that thread and this entire expose came from that thread pulling.

Transcript:  There you go.  All the world's information at your fingertips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Your picks of the week.  Mike Elgin.  This has been a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to fire Jeff and Stacey.  Fire them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elgin.com and becoming nomad.net.  Matthew Ingram with one T.  He's on the Twitter at Matthew I, M-A-T-H-E-W-I, chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.  And our show today brought to you by my home on the Internet, WordPress.  Do you use WordPress?  You ought to use WordPress.  I've used WordPress practically since it started, since Matt Mullenweg invented it.  For a long time, I hosted it myself until I realized, wait a minute, what am I doing spending money for a server and spending a lot of time running it when I could just have WordPress do the work?  That's when I went and moved LeoLaporte.com to WordPress.com.  And man, am I glad.  It's hassle free.  WordPress takes care of the hosting, the security, the software updates.  You focus on your content.  And, you know, I also admit that for a while I went through a kind of a winter of blogging winter, nuclear winter, as I started using Twitter and Facebook.  But now that I'm back, it feels so good to post my content on my site where it belongs.  You know, I posted some stuff from the trip and I got 102 followers from WordPress.  See WordPress.com has its own follow system.  I love that.  And WordPress.com you could choose from hundreds of designs to match your brand or your vision.  It's great for a personal blog, but it's really good for a business blog, too.  You really ought to have a website for your business.  That Facebook page isn't owned by you.  It's owned by a guy named Zuckerberg.  That Twitter page isn't owned by you.  I don't know who it's owned by, but it ain't you.  And you can't control it, right?  But you can control your website.  I have the Akismet anti-spam engine for comments is the best ever.  I love the way comments work on WordPress.  And I use them all the time.  I just think it's fantastic.  Upload the images right to your site so you're hosting them.  Audio and video as well.  Not on YouTube, not somewhere else where it could be taken down or.  Dinked import and export content to and from your site.  Nothing's ever trapped there.  It's your site, your home, your content.  WordPress knows that they support it.  Great tools for search engine optimization, social media linking.  So your followers, your readers can share your site with their Twitter feed and their Facebook.  Great marketing tools, too.  And I love the WordPress app.  I use that to post all through my vacation on my phone and on my tablet.  It was great.  You get great support to 24-7, even with the $4 a month plan.  Yep, that's right.  WordPress plan started $4 a month.  When you add it all up, it's no surprise.  31% of all the websites in the world.  31% run on WordPress.  But don't do it yourself.  Go to WordPress.com.  15% off any new plan purchase at WordPress.com slash twig.  Create your website.  WordPress.com slash twig.  I just added a news feed because I realized now that I don't use Twitter, I don't have a way of putting stories that we're going to cover on the shows on my Twitter feed.  So I've now put them on my blog on a site, just an RSS feed.  It makes it so easy to do that.  It took me three seconds.  WordPress.com slash twig.  Time for picks.  I'm going to start because Lisa and I watched a great documentary last night called Won't You Be My Neighbor.  Have you guys seen this yet?  No, I want to.  Oh my God, I was bawling my eyes out.  It's now available on iTunes.  It's a rental or you can buy it.  I bought it for $10 because I want to own this.  I want to show this to anybody.  It is the most moving story of Mr. Rogers, Fred Rogers, who created a kids show in the 50s that everybody actually, I guess it was the 60s, thought was kind of boring.  They interviewed one producer who said everything you know about good TV, Mr. Rogers did the opposite.  It was slow.  It was it was poor.  You know, the sets were bad every and it was brilliant because he spoke to children as as equals and he changed the world and we need a little bit more of Mr.  Rogers in the world.  So if you haven't seen this, I know you've seen the show, Mr.  Rogers, but there is a great documentary called Won't You Be My Neighbor and I just can't recommend it more highly.  It was it's beautiful.  It's really you just I was in tears the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In addition to what he achieved for children, I mean, he he entered into the public sphere with his children show during the Vietnam War when where kids were watching the war on TV.  He was aware of this a lot of social strife and so on.  And he tried to do something about it.  And but in addition to all that good work that he did, it's also so gratifying to see a media visionary create his entirely a new world from scratch by himself.  Well, not by himself entirely, but like his he invented a language for how to talk to children.  He demystified things like superstition.  For example, the king of the land of make believe was Friday the 13th.  And every time it was actual every time they had a show that was actually Friday the 13th, it was the king's birthday.  And he was deliberately trying to demystify the superstition around Friday the 13th.  Little stuff like that.  Pretty, pretty unbelievable.  He was a huge, huge champion, obviously, public television, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, he gave a famous speech about the value of public television.  It's in the movie.  And it's an incredible moment.  And they got it all in the documentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredible.  And they address all of this stuff.  Vietnam.  He did a show about death.  He did a whole week about race.  Race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a there was a big nationwide scandal at some point where black people were being banned from swimming pools and stuff like that.  So I think he's had a black mailman on the show as a character.  And they said and what they did was they had a show called Black Men.  And they said and what they did was they had a little foot bath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kid swimming pool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he invited he invited.  But it was he was using it to soak his feet.  And he invited a mailman to soak his feet and they soaked their feet together.  Like little things like that.  Yeah.  Not overtly political.  But just, you know, just bringing a level of humanitarianism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That scene is also in it.  And they talked to the actor who played the cop about it.  And they showed that scene.  It is one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.  And I love documentaries.  Won't you be my neighbor?  And it's on iTunes now.  I'm sure that means it's also on Google Play and and the Tom Hanks movie is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tom Hanks plays Mr. Rogers.  Mr. Rogers.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first photo from the set came out and there he is in the red sweater and the sneakers and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's a perfect guy to play Mr. Rogers.  Yeah, definitely.  Mike, what's your pick this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing is consequential or important as that for sure.  But something that's kind of nice for everybody.  It's a website called Light Apps List.  And it's exactly what it sounds like.  Somebody is curating all the light versions of apps that use less battery, less storage, less memory.  For those of us who want to like lighten the load, the collective load of what's happening on our smartphones.  So far, all of the app is a brand new site.  Everything is for Android.  They're going to introduce iPhone versions as well.  And they're inviting their crowdsourcing and stuff like that and going to be adding things to it.  But I love the idea.  So there are light versions of Twitter, light versions of Instagram, of Google Maps, of Google Go, of Gmail, all these like things that people might have heard about or maybe haven't heard about.  But you can by replacing the full featured apps with light versions of those apps, you can like, you know, radically extend your battery life.  Probably the biggest benefit.  So check it out.  Light Apps List dot com.  And it'll click you right to the Play Store to download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And light is spelled L I T E.  Yes.  Light Apps List dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matthew, you got a pick or something you're interested in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was actually on the rundown, but we didn't get to it.  So good.  This is something I'm interested in.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who you might have heard of.  Oh, yeah. We talked about this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want you to explain what this is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't understand a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish I could. So what it sounds like to me is Sir Tim wants to effectively decentralized, re-decentralize the Web.  So I think for some time he's been concerned about kind of centralization around platforms like Facebook and even Google for that matter.  And I think so he started something called Solid and Solid is effectively a protocol or a way of constructing apps that will function in a kind of distributed and decentralized way.  That's the closest I can get to understanding it.  He wrote something ironically in a way on Medium about it because Medium is a bit of a wall garden.  But the idea is to try and, in his words, capture kind of what the Web could have been.  Something that where users have a lot more control and there's a lot more sort of back and forth and interaction and interoperability and control over data.  Things that we've kind of been prevented from having in a way because of the way the Web has developed.  Now, I have to say I looked a little bit at Solid. I installed a sort of I signed up for an iteration of it.  I looked at some of the apps that are available. There's like a notepad sort of thing.  It's very, very early.  It's like looking at a web browser in 1994 or whatever.  So it's but it's the philosophy is fascinating.  And certainly if anybody can kind of push this idea forward, it's Tim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tim has a company called Inrupt.  Solid is open source. Inrupt is a company designed to somehow use Solid.  It isn't all clear. He's taken a leave from the World Wide Web Consortium to do this.  So I think it's he's pretty darn serious about it.  And I've been reading up on Solid and you know, you can make Solid apps if you if you're familiar with HTML and JavaScript, typically React, Angular or GQuery, Vue as well.  So there is some you know, I want to see people make some apps.  Yeah, there aren't there aren't many yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's still pretty early.  But the idea is, you know, the gives more power to individual users, right?  And sort of more power to distributed iterations of things as opposed to centralizing everything behind one company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe this is the solution to that network effect problem.  If you get enough people to use Solid, then you could create apps that take advantage of that without invading people's privacy.  You could have a solid Facebook or Twitter and you would actually have the network effect immediately.  I don't know. It's a really great idea and I wish him success.  But I don't know if I really get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's going to take a while to see, you know, what it's actually capable of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
