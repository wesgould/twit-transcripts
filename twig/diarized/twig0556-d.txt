I got him in there.  And wayward, white-haired people.  And thank you, Craig Newmark, for giving them a lot of money so Jeff could do his job.  Is that a chair? Do you have a chair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I'm sitting on, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's the Craig Newmark chair of something.  Oh, do I have a chair?  I have the Leonard Tau chair for journalism innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the Tau Night Center, which I direct at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a big shot.  He's a big shot.  Former TV Guide critic as well.  Which we say, just to cut him down a few pegs so he doesn't get a big head.  Also, Stacey Higginbotham.  Big page hand.  Who is our IoT guru, our chip maven.  She is at stacey on IoT.com and does the IoT podcast with Kevin Toffle.  You can find that there.  Hello Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a feminine form of guru?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there?  That's why I said maven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I accept guru.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just curious whether they used to be gendered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like a guruette?  That's really.  No, please do not call me any et.  Guruette would be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be a guruette.  Although gurus tend to abuse their followers and can be problematic.  So maybe I don't want to be a guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could be a shaman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I smoke enough or drink any weird teas.  And I'm definitely not into sweat logic.  You don't talk about people on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't see this before the show.  Her she snacks weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not weird.  She's a little chicken.  That's not weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just it's healthy protein and cubes of chicken for a snack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A snack is an excuse to have something that you shouldn't have.  I had two peanut butter cookies.  Oh, that's a snack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lisa ordered internet pretzels today.  We got our internet pretzels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are internet pretzels?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've never bought any pretzels on the internet.  But apparently that's what we do these days.  That's our new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I lived in South Jersey, did you know that besides being able to get milk delivered, you could get pretzels and chips delivered?  Well, there's a story behind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Charlie's chips, right?  We used to have a milkman too in Providence.  We still do.  My mom has one in Cranston.  Really?  What happened was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we have one on Bay Bridge.  Yeah, I bet you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what happened is it got less and less lucrative merely to bring milk, cheese and butter.  So they started adding products.  And I remember in Rhode Island, they started adding milk shampoo and milk conditioner.  And you know, you just got to kind of if you're going to deliver stuff, you got to expand.  True to the brand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This reminds me of the Schitt's Creek episode where he's like, he's got body milk in his store and everyone keeps coming in.  And everyone keeps coming up to him and they're like, can you drink this?  And he's like, it's body milk.  It says so on the thing.  So now I'm like, oh.  Can you drink it?  Yeah.  That does not answer the question.  Can you drink?  You can't drink it.  No, the answer is no, because it's body milk, not drinking.  Not throat milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Throat milk.  Throat milk.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Episode today, five, five, six in our never ending quest to find stories to talk about.  Because, as you know, times have changed and there's not a lot of news, but there is some Google news.  Google is, according to The Verge, working on its own debit card.  Now, the weird thing is Google used to have a credit card.  I remember getting it.  Right.  Yes, I did too.  Yeah.  So Google, this is short sighted from Heim Gartenberg.  They're coming back.  Although it wasn't a debit card.  And I guess the Apple card, which is Goldman Sachs Bank, which is weird.  Fancy.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you have to have a certain credit rating to get it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And wasn't there a big kerfuffle around men getting it and women not getting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of people, Steve Wozniak and David Heinemeyer Hansen, who created Ruby on Rails,  two well-known geek icons, both said, I got a much better credit limit than my wife, who has my same finances,  because she's my wife.  But anyway, Apple says, yeah, well, we talked about this.  The ways of the credit score are varied and mysterious.  But Apple said, OK, we'll fix that.  You know, Lisa got a better credit limit than I did on mine.  So sometimes that's not surprising.  It's probably just based on your credit.  It's personal credit, I would guess.  Yes, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if you're Steve Wozniak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's not buying the $1,600 thermo mix.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google wants to do a Google branded smart debit card.  You know, actually, the Apple card, which I've had for a while, works quite well.  You get cash back.  The nice thing is it's tied to the watch, which is kind of something I guess Google still has Android Wear.  But does anybody wear Android Wear?  But the idea of it.  But they might close Fitbit eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  And the new Fitbit does have pay in it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So nowadays, not touching money or credit cards, but contactless payment at the grocery store,  if you have to go, is to be embraced.  So maybe this is a COVID thing.  I don't know.  The guy came today to do our maintenance.  I think it's a data thing.  I think it's a data thing.  You're right.  So you can get a lot of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And like Facebook even has deals with credit card companies to say, hey, what are people buying?  And so I think Google's like, oh, I would love to know.  And tying that back possibly into advertisements, you could actually say, hey,  this person saw this ad here.  They already do that.  They already do that.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But so they have Google Pay, just like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.  But normally those work by you attach your existing credit cards to it.  So what's different about Apple's credit card is you can use that as your primary payment.  Apple's is an actual charge card.  It's a credit card.  You rack up a bill, you pay it in the month.  Google supposedly, according to The Verge, is a debit card.  They're going to partner with City, Stanford Federal Credit Union.  It's a Visa.  But most debit cards are either a Visa or MasterCard.  But it would take it right out of your bank account as opposed to adding up the charges till the end of the month.  It will do virtual card numbers.  That's one of the real selling points on the Apple credit card is that the merchant doesn't get any information about you.  They don't even get your credit card number.  They get a token and they don't get your address, your real name or any of that stuff.  And of course, merchants hate that.  Google apparently wants to do the same thing.  But you know who gets the information?  Apple and Google in Google's case.  So it's not like they're giving up any information.  Customers will be able to use the Google Pay app to lock their card in the event of theft or loss, according to The Verge, or lock the account entirely.  Google's app reportedly, and there is a picture of the app, so this leak is pretty well sourced,  will reportedly allow customers to easily track purchases using Google Maps and its database of retailers.  Would you get a Google debit card or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like debit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I don't like having a PIN number.  Right.  It is the stupidest reason.  Right.  Some people don't like it because...  I pay my credit cards in full.  So I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just that's like a debit card then, right?  The rules protecting you, I seem to remember with debit cards, are not as strict as with credit cards, right?  So in theory, you can get financially hurt more by a debit card.  Although most banks voluntarily limit your liability with a debit card, I think.  I don't know. I don't mind a debit card.  In fact, I kind of like it because I know it's going to come right out of my bank account and I'm not going to have to.  But I do.  I pay off my credit cards too.  So, yeah.  The Apple card I do use.  I like it partly because it changes color depending on what you buy.  Oh, my goodness.  Talk about gaming, gamifying something.  When you buy something with your Apple card, if it's a grocery store, it's brown.  If it's electronics, it's blue.  So you get this nice rainbow.  Didn't you know what you just bought?  It's just a gaming thing, gamify thing.  That's all.  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  Let me see if I can open my wallet and show you what color.  What color is your Apple card?  That could be a novel.  Mine looks like it's slightly stained.  Can you show my over the shoulder shot, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't want to. Is your number on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, of course not.  It's an Apple card.  So you see it looks like a little halo.  But if I were to buy something at Apple, there'd be another color in there.  And then when you pay it off, it gets white again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's utterly useless.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  It makes me want to buy stuff from different places so I can get prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's telling us about it and other people like, that's fine.  I'm totally going to go get an Apple card.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you get 1%, 2% or 3% back depending on where you buy it.  Although I think Apple is getting more generous with the cash back during COVID.  Is it at the Apple store?  Yes, you get most if you buy it from Apple.  So since the stuff I buy from Apple tends to be high ticket items,  because Apple doesn't sell no cheap stuff, you get 3% off your Apple stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure I got a case there for under $40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get 3% off a thing that has a markup of about 80%.  Exactly.  Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you think they do that?  Hey, are you a socialist?  Apple is making some dough.  Ever more, yes.  Nowadays we're all maybe tending in a little that direction.  Google says it's now displaying information for over 2,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 43 states.  Not that you can go, but...  I saw on the press conference the president was showing a map of Maryland  and how there was all these testing centers and saying,  I don't know why the governor had to buy tests from South Korea.  Look at all these testing centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cruelest part...  Well, there's many cruel things, especially if you're African American or Latino or disabled in this country.  But the testing world alone, the cruelest thing is making people who are sick  stay overnight in their cars so they can get tested for disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the line that long? You have to sleep in your car to get in the...  Some places it is.  Especially in hard-hit areas.  In a sensible world, you'd call your doctor,  and the doctor would say, oh, those symptoms, you need to come in right away and we'll test you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boston has an app.  So in Boston there's an app.  You go on, you put your symptoms in, and you can get an appointment.  That makes sense.  Massachusetts is also hiring contact tracers.  So they're ahead in a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verily, Google's sister company is offering free tests to people  in parts of California, New Jersey, and New York, and Pennsylvania.  But you have to do an online screening, a symptom screening.  We are not close to the...  Although in some areas I guess you can get a test, anybody can get a test.  But most of the time right now you get tested if you have symptoms.  You know what I got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is illogical in and of itself,  because what you're going to have to do to open up again...  Eventually, yes.  ...is you're going to have to test those prices you don't know of the disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right, because of the asymptomatic component.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, A and pre-symptomatic, both.  My doctors in my Twitter list are very careful to distinguish between the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Asymptomatic means you go through the whole disease with no symptoms at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's much debate as to how prevalent that is, if at all.  Pre-symptomatic is that you're contagious two or three days before you start showing symptoms.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it could be up to a week, right?  And you know what? That's not unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a number of illnesses that that's the case.  That's not an unusual thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a pretty long incubation period where you're shedding the virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you're communicative, but you don't know you are,  and you're walking around and all that.  That's why we're all staying home, right? Communicable.  You bet your bippy.  That's why we're all staying home.  I'm so tired of staying home.  Are you? Where would you go?  Because you work at home, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at least twice a week, I would go work with a friend at a coffee shop.  Oh, that's nice.  Just for an hour or two.  Forget it. It's over. It's gone. Life has changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When will we ever be able to do that? I look at now and watch movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we get a vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we do.  If we do, and it's an if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is an if. We don't have vaccines for HIV or colds or a lot of things.  I watch movies and I see people doing normal, what we used to do.  Hey, guys, separate.  You could get it's so funny how quickly that gets in your mind, isn't it?  It is. Our dean is figuring out how to do social distancing at the school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.  If some people start coming back at some point, it's hard to imagine.  They're about to reopen.  Have you seen the six foot office?  The six foot office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is by Gensler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here it is. I've got it.  I'll put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You found it.  Yep.  It's an architectural firm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cushman and Wakefield.  Oh, Cushman and Wakefield.  Sorry.  That's a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, developer.  So it consists of a six foot quick scan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have a video.  OK.  Here.  That's the video.  Watch the video to learn more about is this going to be our future office workspace?  Hello.  Well, some parts of it are.  It does look like billions, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  It's a fancy office.  I have a lot of questions about this intro segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks just like billions.  With the ambition to get the world safer and sooner back at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you enter, you do a little purification, you get a little Purell shot, just like a cruise ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You walk down a complete.  Oh, look, did you see their lines on the floor?  You wait six hours to get one person on an elevator.  OK.  Nobody can go in with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  Is at the center of what's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have to step on that circle.  There's a circle in the elevator.  Stick to the rules.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Follow the signs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to our new fascist state.  Right.  One way only.  Take your piece of paper, bring it to your workplace.  Oh, my.  Do you have to?  What is the piece of?  Oh, the piece of paper goes under your computers.  Yeah, your hot desking kind of thing.  So that's and this is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The carpet.  You'll see it in the.  Wait a minute.  Walk the off.  Wait a minute.  Do you see one of our new rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You only walk one direction.  You can only walk clockwise.  What does it even look like to walk?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's so you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I guess two women were a lot closer than six feet.  Yeah, but they're not facing each other.  Oh, but they have a plan.  They are.  They're far apart.  They're six feet apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then these these circles in the video underneath.  Six feet tall.  That's not six feet.  I know six feet.  But there was a platform.  That's six feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know six feet.  But there was a plastic barrier to between.  Well, yeah, like air doesn't go over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi there.  Enter meeting rooms as indicated.  This is such a dystopian future.  This is out of a Christmas and Netherlands.  So the Netherlands, they don't mind.  OK, so that you put your of the what's the point of the piece of paper?  I don't get it.  To isolate you from their desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you don't put your stuff on the desk.  This is terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your keyboard and it goes, goes, smits it around all the time.  Why do they have couches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no point in having a couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One person could sit on it.  But yeah, so there's there's there's the office of the future.  And I would add to that, if you want to get really crazy, what's going to happen is you're going to have cameras places.  Yeah, you might even have badges like Estimote.  I don't know if you saw they have Bluetooth beacon badges now that for office for industrial workers, but you could put it on an office.  You wear this on your lanyard or as a thing around your neck and.  It'll beep whenever another person, another beacon gets within six feet of you.  So basically someone, everyone has these.  And so as you're walking around, if people get within your space bubble, you'll hear beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And theirs will go beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And you'll be all like, get away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my question, I have a couple of questions.  First of all, we have been surprisingly compliant.  Right.  I would have thought, especially in our individualistic United States of America, there would be more people saying, no, I ain't going to do that.  But people have been you walk down the streets of Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nuts are very small in number, way too much coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But that's there's nothing else to talk about.  TV has to do something.  So we're pretty compliant.  And and I think that we might even do this.  The problem is, I think it gets in your head and pretty soon you you become a germaphobe.  Like you don't like if if if then the all clear sounds you say, but I'm still going to go clockwise in my office and put a piece of paper down because it's safe.  It's healthy.  I think I'm so I don't think here's the thing.  Even though we've been compliant, I feel like people are going to go.  No, I'm just going to get it.  And if my old people die, well, it's time.  Do you think people are just going to rebel and say, screw it?  You can't. This is too much.  Only if you're Las Vegas.  That's about and I mentioned that's about to happen in Las Vegas.  They want to I think May 1st, they want to reopen.  What do you only walk counterclockwise in the casino?  Gamblers love that.  They're already compulsive.  Gamblers will go. Sure.  If it improves my chances of winning, I'll do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what if you're one of those people who feel that, you know, you've got to walk counterclockwise and win?  That's going to be really upsetting.  There are going to be problems.  I so I think we will see some change.  I do think I mean, I've been thinking about what happens if we don't get a vaccine and people don't have immunity for very long with this, if at all, because we still don't actually know that.  That's the worst. By the way, worst case scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the worst case.  We don't we can't prevent it and we don't get a treatment.  It looks like we may have some treatments.  That's good news.  Not chloroquine, but we may have some treatments.  That might be some good news.  Maybe even the treatments involving plasma from people who've already survived didn't have antibodies or maybe treatments.  But let's say worst case scenario, no treatments, no vaccine.  This is the new normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then I think what will happen is most white collar work that can go remote will go remote.  And I think you'll see if children are less affected, you'll probably see schools open up with more social distancing.  And we saw that.  I'm really curious to see what happens in Denmark.  Teachers will have to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there'll be no teachers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worry that they will not be able to touch the children online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Online.  Honestly, I was surprised.  My kid's been going to high school online, entirely online.  He's a senior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But your kids in high school and my kids in middle school.  But at fifth grade, you can't stick a 10 year old, maybe a 10 year old girl, but probably not.  Are they doing it now?  Somewhat, but they're not really.  Mine is 13.  She's in middle school.  She's doing a great.  But like, I mean, a few years ago, no.  And she's super conscientious.  They just don't have the they don't have the attention span.  Parents don't have.  And, you know, not to mention the fact that we don't have broadband everywhere, which is another issue.  So, yeah, I think I think testing, I think good contact tracing.  If we can develop something that is a more immediate test, you might, you know, checking for fevers constantly.  Maybe every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carson's wife, Kimmy, teaches kindergarten and he says they are not learning as much as they should be.  I think it's really a lot.  There's going to be a generation with a lost year of schooling or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we just got to deal with that.  We got to say that you went through a lot and that's what it is.  I just put up a terrible for all the seniors graduating without walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Paul Thuratt's daughter graduated from high school.  But you're right.  It's what you know, people suffered in World War One or War Two, you know, and then the whole generation had stories to tell for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just put up an MIT technology review piece on machine learning to check if your social distancing properly at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just yes, I feel like yes.  And you'll have a big klaxon that goes, get apart, get apart.  Well, it will also be cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll have a little this, you have a little green squares and red squares.  Red squares bad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe I mean, I think that it's possible to design all of this and sensible.  And I don't think it'll happen because it's too dystopian.  And I think at some point people are just going to say, oh, the heck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it will happen in grocery stores and settings for sure.  So we already at our grocery stores.  You can only walk certain ways.  There's one way I.  Right.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the theory being if you're cross, you might breathe on each other.  So this way you're at least breathing down somebody's neck instead of breathing in the face.  I'm going to have to get a neck mask now.  Yes, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we'll see.  What happens to the economy if this becomes two years of the new normal or more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens to the economy?  I don't think we'll grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless we want to invest in the economy.  And what about all the people who are unemployed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to have to have universal basic income.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's major shifts of wealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's I mean, we have enough with taxation.  We could we have a lot of levers that currently we're not pulling.  But I also think this is a good opportunity for I mean, think about the things we are suddenly like, oh, crap, we need to do this.  Think about revamping health care and what that might look like.  Think about boosting broadband and investing in that.  Those are going to be jobs.  Think about dealing with climate change and electrification.  We actually could invest in those areas and build a better long term everything and create jobs for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We built an entire economy essentially based on service.  Yeah, that's really the U.S. economy.  You know, it's interesting because I've already thought about this for Twitter and we seem to be handling work at home fine.  I think we can continue indefinitely doing what we're doing.  It's not comfortable or easy.  You know, normally on Wednesday, you've been here for that, Jeff.  I think Stacey has to.  We have lunch in the conference room.  We get food and then it's very social.  Everybody loves it.  So they they did it today via Zoom.  I don't know when I missed it, but I don't I don't know.  Well, I know what Karsten had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what Karsten had.  What?  I said bitterly.  What?  Queso from Chipotle?  No.  He sent it to me and I sent it to you.  Hold on.  I was like, we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said he had Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get one of the drinks from the Cantina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten sent me a picture of him eating Taco Bell.  That's how funny that's Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrick had mini ravioli out of a can.  Patrick, I guess so.  Nobody makes mini ravioli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've worked from home for companies for I've worked for three different companies.  So the Daily Deal in New York, Time Inc.  and Giga Ohm and things like Slack.  Actually, remote work is you can still have social and create bonds of friendship or whatever virtually.  And I mean, yes, I also saw those people to maybe three times a year for events.  But even if I hadn't, I really got a chance to get to know those people over the social channels.  And that was part of the culture.  Like I noticed when I got to Fortune, it was really weird.  To establish myself as a virtual person there because they had already established a culture of physically present in the office.  They were mostly in the office at Fortune.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I attended our editorial meetings, you know, every day in via conference call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I think it can be done.  And I think people can.  I mean, I'm still working on it.  And again, I didn't see them.  I've only met you once in person, Stacey.  Yeah, that's a good point right here.  Right here.  You've learned to hate me without ever being in the same place.  I want to physically hit you at least once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there you go.  What more could you ask for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So actually, when I met you in person, Leo, I thought you were a lot nicer than you are on the show.  I have different duties on the show.  I know, I was like, oh, Leo is a delightful human being who isn't trying to poke my, poke me all the time being like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My duty is to make the show interesting and I don't care about your feelings.  It's funny because, yeah, in person, I am not a confrontational person at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I have a lot of experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was in my 20s.  It's funny because, yeah, in person, I am not a confrontational person at all.  I just want everybody to like me.  It's like Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly like Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because when I started in broadcasting, I was...  In fact, somebody called me, he said, you're Mr. Smiley Smiley.  Knock it off.  I wanted to be liked.  I want to be nice.  I want to be myself.  And I quickly learned...  Well, not quickly.  It took me about 15 years.  But 15 years into my career, my failed career, I learned that the best way to be is like,  I don't give a damn and screw you.  Like, yeah, Howard Stern is probably a nice guy in person.  Oh, yeah.  But he's kind of screw you on the air because it's much more interesting.  Nobody wants ingratiating.  Ingratiating is awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the funny thing about broadcast is that every time I did a tryout for a broadcast gig,  you know, TV critic on the air, you got to get the smile in your voice.  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That won't...  No, they were wrong because I used to do that.  I can smile in my voice.  You can tell even if you're listening that I'm smiling right now, can't you?  Even if you're not looking, you know I'm smiling.  And I want to slap you.  Yeah, it's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Stacey wants to punch you.  It's awful.  The smiling isn't a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, you just come off as angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, angry is not good either.  What you really want to be...  You got a problem with that?  What you really want to be is insuciant.  Like, you like me, don't like me, I don't care.  I am who I am.  That's what you really want to be.  I'm too cool for school.  Yeah.  But actually, angry is not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you use words like insuciant, you ain't getting on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's actually true.  NBC's one word review of me when I was supposed to be their chief correspondent on the site was,  Leo, ick.  No.  Yeah.  David Borman told me that.  David Borman, who then later later went on to become the Washington bureau chief at CNN and created the 3D virtual reporter.  Right.  And a great guy lives up here.  But he was the VP in charge from NBC of the site.  And he said, yeah, because I was supposed to be the chief correspondent.  I was supposed to be like on the air every day.  And he said, no, let me tell you what they said in New York.  Thanks, David.  He pulled no punches.  That's all right.  You know what?  You're broadcasting a deserve.  Did you see the article there?  A number of them.  Information had a good one.  People are getting burned out from Zoom because they're on camera all the time.  And we don't have that problem, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I felt really bad for it.  They because I felt like this is this is kind of like a hate click article, right?  Because the lead was this woman who wanted to get her lips filled because she was like,  oh, my lips look terrible on camera.  And I was like, oh, man, why did they do that?  You know, because I can totally see women are constantly judged by their appearances.  Right.  And being on camera is hard.  I mean, you will never see me without a full face of makeup on the show ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But because I some.  So this was this was the question.  Is it outside pressure or is it internal pressure?  Because, you know, a lot of people first hear their voice on a recording go, oh, I sound like that.  And I think probably same thing.  People see themselves on camera and they go, oh, my God.  And now they're forced to stare at themselves on camera hours and hours a day.  Or is it that they feel like they're getting peer pressure to you should really look better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's internal because there's an external need.  I mean, as a woman, I'm like, I know I don't look professional unless I meet a certain standard.  Right. So you've got to look professional on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. It's true.  Women on TV have always felt much more pressure.  They have to they can't wear the same dress two days in a row.  All right. There's there are even clothing rental companies designed for broadcasters.  Becky Worley, I never do that. Yeah, because you can't if you're a weather girl or a news reporter  or an anchor, you can't. Guys, I wear the same.  I rotate my jackets. I only have about 10 of them.  I don't know. I can wear a different.  But women can't. So there there are literally rental things mostly for weather reporters  because they're wearing dresses so that they never wear the same thing twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And they have to their own salary, by the way.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. The company doesn't pay. No, no, no, no.  So, yeah, you're it's it's not awesome unless you're like Katie Coric.  I'm sure she's got some things in her contract. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, some people do. In fact, when we first started on tech TV, we had a wardrobe mistress  and we had they would take pictures of us.  She went out and bought a lot of clothes for everybody.  That went away really quickly. That and the makeup artists disappeared.  You do your own makeup, wear your own wardrobe.  So that was whoa, no makeup. Oh, well, you you had to put it on yourself.  Yeah. Yeah. That's when we knew tech TV was in trouble when they there were three things that happened.  One was they got rid of the makeup artists.  Two was they got rid of the wardrobe person.  And three was they got rid of the oatmeal, the free oatmeal in the snack room.  That was really the thing. That was the final straw.  When people couldn't have breakfast. Right, Carson? You come in.  No oatmeal. Come on, man. Next, it's going to be coffee.  So I've always made sure that we know you can't take coffee away from the journalists.  No, I can't take coffee away from anybody. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time, we had we had free Pepperidge Farm cookies and wine and beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? They used to have a bar cart that drove around Fortune's office when the magazine closed.  Yes. Right. Such a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. If you were a senior editor above, your credenza was stocked with liquor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually had to send a memo saying no more drinking in the office  because Anthony is a very talented mixologist.  There is still in the cupboard over here all kinds of booze and mixers and stuff.  And come come, you know, well, it started.  It was Friday at the end of the week. Right.  And then it slipped to Thursday.  By the time after a while, I was like, it's Wednesday.  Let's all get a drink.  And everybody was drinking in the office.  And I was really worried not so much that productivity would go down,  but that somebody would get in an accident going home.  And I didn't want that. Yeah. So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it? I think it was GitHub.  If I remember correctly, had a whole stock bar there.  I thought that's not good in office.  I think it's what if you're recovering? Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just did. I felt like it's nice.  Everybody's convivial. I'm really happy.  You know, having a good time and you're happy.  But let's not do that anymore.  I don't want to go to the office Christmas party every week.  Yeah. Christmas party every week.  That was pretty. That's pretty much it.  But we did make a good drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. The drinks he made for the show that we did at Christmas.  Remember that? The Christmas show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He made a different drink for every person on the panel.  So fancy.  To match their personality.  Poor man. He was not feeling.  Yeah. He was sick.  Can you imagine?  Nowadays, somebody's sick making you drinks.  You would jail them.  Jail them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  I'd be like, oh, it kills all things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a PTSD psychic burden that we are all imposing upon ourselves.  And it's not going to, I don't think it's going to go away right away.  It's like the people in the Great Depression who were penny pitchers to their very last dying breath.  Right? It hits you in the brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I wrote the day I wrote about this, the day that the death toll passed 9-11,  it brought it all back for me. And it was, I realized it was the PTSD.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.  You suffer still from PTSD from 9-11.  But that was one discrete event.  This is going to habitually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as I wrote then, this is 9-11 in slow-mo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Very, very slow-mo, isn't it?  Yes.  And now, of course, we far exceeded that death number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And it's going to be much bigger than that because I'm finally doing the calculation that I proposed to editors three weeks ago  and nobody listened to me. And finally, the New York Times and the FT are doing it.  They're looking at so-called excess mortality.  The total deaths over the average is more likely a count.  So many people are dying at home.  Minus a few auto accidents we don't have.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to mention all the divorces.  Well, that's a cheery beginning to the show.  Not to mention all the divorces and the children who will be born in nine months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the other? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to find out on the Google story about Google helping you find unemployment data based on your state.  Yeah.  I can't find that. I can't find the Google update on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was wondering...  This isn't a gadget story. Do you think they got it wrong or...  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe Google pulled it. I'm looking for the actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here is the Google link. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, it does. Okay.  It does. If I search unemployment, I get help and information for Washington Employment Security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, and they know where you are.  That's another thing. Are we going to become more complacent about privacy?  We talked a couple of weeks ago about the Apple Google plan.  Now, by the way, France is upset because they say we have created a program, an application for your phone,  but Apple will not let us use their Bluetooth information.  Apple says you can't use Bluetooth location information if it gets sent away outside of the phone.  It violates privacy. And the French authorities say, who cares? We want it.  And that's an interesting clash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the government wants more data than Apple.  The government wants more data.  I always tell you, I always say government is not your friend in privacy. Government is the key enemy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the primary industry.  Here is, and I think Apple's right. So Microsoft, this week, Microsoft put out privacy policies.  I just dropped it under security in our rundown Microsoft's security stands.  We'll just call it that.  And it's there, preserving privacy while addressing COVID-19.  And it's written by Julie Brill, who is now their chief privacy officer and used to be at the FTC.  And this list is excellent. It's seven points.  It talks about obtaining consent, getting data only for public health, getting the minimal amount of data  and let users store and control their data so they get to choose whether it's on their device or in the cloud.  And then you can't share it with people without consent or minimize what's shared  and then delete it when you no longer need it for the emergency, which I thought was actually a pretty that's a bold step right there.  So I actually thought these were excellent privacy protecting principles.  And I was I wasn't surprised that Microsoft's doing this.  Brad Smith has been very forward thinking about this.  Julie Brill was on the FTC when the FTC started looking at privacy related to like IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Brad Smith is at the front of this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this was I just thought this was good. I don't know if you found the link yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now we have somewhere I was in the rundown.  A Republican senator is saying jobs and bachai it's all on you from Missouri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an abdication of their job. It should be on everybody. Sorry.  And I don't know. Yeah, this is you know, I'm a little cynical when Microsoft publishes something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sure. They have an agenda like like they actually push forward facial recognition laws.  The Washington state is one of the first ones and Microsoft basically wrote our facial recognition use law.  Is it a good law? There are good things about it like all laws. It's a compromise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a common corporate jujitsu. Right.  If you see a train coming down the track at you to cleverly write a law that protects your real interests while appearing to protect the public interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that law does say that, you know, governments need a warrant.  There's a third party audit ability on the facial recognition stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's one thing that these guys do is they say, well, government really needs to prove they need it.  Meanwhile, but we're going to get it. It's OK if we get it.  Well, we'll take that information. It's like Google making a credit card saying the your Apple saying the merchants not going to get any personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you are. Well, to be clear, Microsoft with regards to covid-19 data is saying one should have it except for the public health.  Right. Companies, companies that need it for that.  And that when they're done, it should have a limited time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the same as the medium post we referred to a couple of weeks ago where it was saying these these are the things that you know are you have to do to protect people.  And I agree with that. But also in a crisis, you know, you can at the beginning of the crisis have the best intentions.  But when it comes down to it and people are dying, it may be that we all go, yeah, OK, fine.  But please, Microsoft, give France the information. Yeah.  Or Apple, Apple, give France the information because we need to save lives at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's being a little less. We asked about this. You asked about this last time.  You know, the how many people are going to use it? I can't find it now.  Because all of these things are voluntary, right?  Oxford did a study that if half use it, it's it reduces the huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So you don't need 100 percent compliance any more than your mask has to be 100 percent perfect.  Your whole goal is to reduce the R-naut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  60 percent compliance.  But Singapore's track and trace, let's see where their compliance is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're an authoritarian government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I would. Their track and trace compliance is like less than 20 percent the last week when I looked.  Yeah. So that's why I said so.  It was what's very what is their app called?  But Singapore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're not even though they could at this point, they're not enforcing the use of this app.  It's still voluntary. I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But why can't I find the name? That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't need the gist. What's the name going to do? I'm not downloading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's OK. Oh, well, no, the name the name gets me the actual data point that I want because it was less than 20 percent last week.  But this week it may be more. It may be less.  The point is, I want to make sure we're factual.  You know me, you know me in my journalistic cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know me. I couldn't care less facts.  Schmacks.  And this is why Stacey hates me.  I don't hate you.  No, I'm teasing. I know you don't.  I loved. Here's a perfect example.  Benjamin Netanyahu, whose trial was supposed to begin yesterday for corruption.  Oh, but the covid.  Oh, but the covid.  Let's close the courts down.  No trial. The courts are closed down.  It's you watch because this is going to be a wonderful cover for a lot of companies and a lot of corruption and a lot of corruption.  Oh, but the covid is going to be the new the new saying.  Of course, there's some terrible stuff going on.  Amazon has suspended six thousand accounts worldwide for price gouging.  I was looking at a blood oximeter because I you know, that's one of the things they say is if you do get sick, watch your oxygen level because that's an early warning sign.  And I thought it'd be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of people can't find those right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have and check the prices on them as they go up, up, up, up, up, up.  And the one I bought from Viatom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The price. Only 20% of the population has downloaded the tracing app from Singapore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what you said.  You're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I needed to know that that was accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was accurate.  Now y'all know she's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was as of April 12th.  So that was a weekend.  It is surprising.  We're back to pulse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, maybe that's what happens when you have an authoritarian government.  If they don't compel you to do something, you're going to not do it.  That's kind of the well, it does.  Public trust, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just noticed the oximeter I bought, the price has gone from $110 to $162 within a few days up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got the well, you know, the well, you what is it?  Well, you well, you I put it in the in the rundown chat and you like it.  Oh, to ring. Love it.  Love it. It's very good.  The idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there was a good article in the New York Times yesterday by an emergency room physician.  What he said.  Very good.  Wasn't that I thought.  Really?  Well, that was terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now I like I have covid and I don't know it.  I mean, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what he said was, you know, we know that once your lungs just basically solidify that you can't breathe without moving your, you know, forcing them to breathe.  That's when we're going to put you on a vent.  But that, he said, is really way down the road.  You turns out your lung function starts to fail very early on, but you don't notice it because you're still able to expel carbon dioxide.  So you don't feel short of breath.  But what's happening is the virus is damaging the surfactants in your lungs.  So you're not getting oxygen.  So an oximeter is a good early warning.  Simmits sign, because if your blood oxygen goes, you know, normally be in the 90s, it should be nice.  Seven.  But if it goes down precipitously, even if you can breathe, you hide the to the hospital because that's it.  He said, if we can get you, then we can treat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the treatment is on forced oxygen, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they're starting to do that.  They're doing cannulas instead of vents.  But yeah, they flip you over and they flip you over.  There's all sorts of things that they can do.  It's like a heart attack or anything else.  The sooner you get there, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the crazy thing right now is that everybody's being told don't go in because they didn't have the capacity because they don't have the test.  They don't know.  Right.  It got so bad in some cases that they were doing CT scans instead of because they didn't have any tests.  The only way was to look at your lungs.  Right.  It's a horrendous abrogation of responsibility to humanity.  What's going on? It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing bothers me more, honestly, is all the failings of late stage capitalism in this country, the huge income inequality.  And it really bothers me more that more poor people and people of color are dying.  They're losing their jobs.  They're forced to go to work in a dangerous situation because they can't afford to lose their job.  All of these issues, you know, we upper middle class folk are surviving fine.  But it just breaks my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Nicole Hannah Jones, who's a brilliant journalist on the New York Times, an investigative journalist, Ida Baywells is her Twitter account.  She said stop calling the clerks in the stores heroes.  They're not their victims.  It's insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're victims.  Yeah.  And again, it breaks my heart.  And I go to the store and these people, they have to work because it's their job.  It's the only thing they can do.  And they're risking their lives because the protections are not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she said to call them heroes is to justify their exploitation by praising blue collar workers, public service, the progressive consumers, assuaged of her cognitive dissonance from the Atlantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, the poor grunts who had to go onto the front line and take the fire, they were heroes too, right?  It is the people who have to face the onslaught.  And they're usually the poorest, least advantaged among us, unfortunately.  And that's kind of like life.  It's not a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what Stacey was saying earlier.  That's what's that's the those are the besides trying to build broadband and build infrastructure.  We have to rebuild the structure of society.  That's the thing.  And that's the cracks are showing.  Oh, this brings out every bit.  These inequities were all cracks have been showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is actually the utter just the cracks just collapsed everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, US judge blocks Twitter's bid to reveal government surveillance requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This goes back six years.  Twitter's been fighting for us and we lost.  Yeah, they wanted to do a transparency report that would include surveillance requests received from the US government.  A federal judge said that would harm national security.  No, you don't.  You can't do it.  I can't.  I mean, I can't knock that.  That's the way it's supposed to work.  Right.  I appreciate Twitter trying to find a market.  I can knock it.  Well, but what if it does hurt national security?  I'm lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do I trust this government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't trust the government saying national security.  Well, OK, it's not the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took a restodent to let us know what was going on.  It's the courts, though.  I mean, look, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's the courts, but the courts are stacked now.  So I just don't know.  My confidence in the system and in the courts has been purposely eroded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet it is conceivable that it would damage national security to do this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could, but I'm not going to know now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we can work our way around national security.  I think we have solved those.  I mean, it violates national security that we do not live in glass houses and don't have door locks, right?  I mean, yeah, we have to we have to make decisions about how far we want our privacy to extend and where we want the government.  And I think the government, because of its power, the power to bring the state against a citizen is so great, they really have to justify the ability to look into our lives to the extent that they can with.  So I think they're trying to make a case.  I don't think the case they're been making is compelling.  So but, you know, if judges believe it, then then we'll lose that.  Yeah, I mean, you're right.  I mean, the theory is that you have a nonpartisan adjudication from somebody who's going to look at both sides and say, well, yeah, the government's made its case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is a case that's been made.  I think the judge is going to look at both sides and say, well, yeah, the government's made its case.  This is this could potentially be damaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the name of the judge?  Let's look up the judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was from the northern California, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, US District Court for Northern California, which normally is a pretty liberal jurisdiction.  But, you know, I don't know this judge who's Democrat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, the Democrats know Obama wasn't great with us either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, she's probably an Obama appointment, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But where does it say?  So, Obama, yep, Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but I mean, look, all we got is the system.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the system is being torn down.  Yeah.  So we just don't know.  I put my reflex now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you also have to wait against the public need.  Is what Twitter is reporting in this transparency report important public information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about that for a second, because what what does Twitter actually know about you?  The only thing they can really report to the government is your IP.  Everything else is well, and I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your identity.  Look at what happened with the Saudi regime when they put agents inside Twitter to track who was behind certain accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you an example from my own life.  My daughter.  This was several years ago.  We've always had horrible troll problems.  I don't know why.  Something I did, I guess.  But we've my daughter.  Ten years ago, maybe a long time ago, she was a teenager, a kid, got what was essentially a death threat.  And I wrote to Ev because I knew him and I said, Ev, can you help us?  You got a kid, you got a daughter, you understand?  No.  So we were lucky.  We found a Petaluma police detective who was willing to take on the case.  He filed a subpoena and using the IP information provided by Twitter because they respond to a lawful subpoena.  He was then able to get a colleague.  He found the location.  It was a Chicago ISP.  He was able to get a colleague in the Chicago Police Department to subpoena the ISP and said, who was using this IP address at this time?  And they found it was a kid.  The detective in Petaluma got the Chicago PD guy to go over to the kid's house, talk to his dad.  That was the end of it.  However, if it had been somebody who really did want to do the nasty things that this tweet said, you know, the question that the police ask is, are you in fear of your life?  And if you are, they can act on it.  So that was a government request for information.  I think completely legitimate.  Now, I think that that probably would have appeared in a transparency report as one of, you know, we got 700 government requests this year and responded to this many of them.  What is the public need to know that number?  Is it important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's important for journalists who are trying to track what's happening because they're not just it's not just things like your police request.  It's also things like not FISA necessarily, but there might be FISA requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that probably would be my guess that it's the FISA request that Twitter wanted to reveal.  And the judge said, no, you can't.  Right. Because those are those are national security interests.  That's we're trying to get a terrorist and we think we can get them.  And the FISA court can even say and Twitter, you cannot say anything about this request because revealing the request will alert the terrorists to the fact that we're on to them.  So that's national security.  And that is the Patriot Act does allow that.  And so it may well be we don't know that the judge said, yeah, I'm looking at some of these and some of these are that kind of FISA record request.  And it would harm national security to reveal the interest of the, you know, the FBI in this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that could be way back when when I ran local sites, the most common subpoenas we got were from police chiefs fine trying to find out the names of the unnamed police officers who were using our forms to complain about the chief.  Right.  Obviously, that's not a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not cool.  That's not that happens.  But that's the point is you can't paint it all with one that's there's a variety.  But that's and I don't think the transparency.  You're trying to deal with.  But does the transparency report give you the information you would need to say, oh, I see what's going on here.  Gee, there's a lot of requests coming from police in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you also I mean, those transparency reports are designed to act as a canary in the right for saying hey, the government is I mean, so basically to say you can't do that.  It stops journalists.  It stops national security.  It's in the Patriot Act.  I'm going it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Patriot Act does allow.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw this episode of The Good Wife.  Goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called a national security letter.  But I think the law already says that Twitter can't report that in their transparency report.  By the way, NLS is do not require prior approval from a judge.  So there the Patriot Act gives law enforcement some sweeping.  This is this is the analogy that you want to pay attention to during this time because of 9-11 and the terror in 9-11.  We gave law enforcement sweeping powers that were never then retracted.  And here we are almost 20 years later.  They still have those powers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So sunsetting is an important design element.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Patriot Act does sunset, but it keeps getting renewed.  It's going to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that actually the things I go on.  You go.  I was going to say, I think it's really important for these track and trace efforts for COVID-19 for governments.  If they're trying to get people, if you're going to eliminate the opt in or if you're going to try to encourage people to do to share your data, I think having a very narrowly defined.  Ask and then sunsetting that ask at either a time frame or when we achieve a certain policy goal, like, you know, a hundred cases per day nationwide or something.  So I think having those kind of if we're going to do some sort of nationwide surveillance for track and trace, we need to have those kind of sunsetting narrowly defined in rules that sunset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there's two.  Then there's to be, you know, to be is kind of an interesting over the top stream.  I think it's over the top streaming service because it's free, but it's ad supported.  Fox recently bought them.  They are now going to TransUnion, the credit bureau, to get information about viewers so they can do targeted advertising.  By the way, this is so not illegal that they put out a press release saying they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can you.  Can you do that?  I think it's a venture firm from.  Yeah, Canoe Ventures was a venture backed effort by a couple of cable companies to do exactly this way back in 2009 or 2010.  And it failed because people were like, no.  But yeah, this is this is the dream to be to be to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The partnership will combine its understanding of content viewing behaviors with TransUnion's cross verified consumer database by creating a link from a device ID.  It can draw insights around consumer preference.  Quote, this is Matt Spiegel, executive vice president of marketing solutions and media vertical at TransUnion.  Quote, the integrated the integration of TransUnion data assets can help companies connect the dots to gain a more comprehensive understanding of today's consumer and reach them with confidence, especially as they move and consume content in new ways.  With identifiers such as third party cookies on the decline because we don't like them and we're blocking them and media consumption changing alternative identifiers such as home IP address are imperative for building a strong foundation of individual level identity and reaching consumers on devices like connected TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, your smart data is are oftentimes sending.  They're not tying into TransUnion, but they are sending a lot more data than most people anticipate.  But that is the problem is that any individual data you could say, well, what do they have the IP address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But any individual data, once it's combined with these other streams and my God, the credit unions have so credit bureaus have so much information about every financial transaction that they have.  If you can cross reference my IP address, figure out my name and then tie in my credit data, you know everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they'll use that to extrapolate out thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But all they're going to do is what show ads.  So they're going to so like, well, Leo lives in an area where he's likely to get cancer because so we're going to send him some ads for some medicine.  That kind of thing. I don't know what's wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may be something as simple. I mean, like I like when I buy my house, I don't report is going to definitely know that I have a mortgage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So I am as Leo was screaming that that all targeting should be killed.  This is a case point in point of his role as provocateur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe yes, maybe no. You don't know.  I don't know the real Leo.  Yeah. To be says Lachlan Murdoch in a statement will immediately expand our direct ticket.  This is Fox will immediately expand our direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I need to know.  But I guess Fox is Disney now, right?  No, no, this is Fox.  Oh, this is Fox. That's all I know.  Fox Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Evil thrown.  Because Fox didn't have any of this stuff with the sale of its assets to Disney.  They want to build up all this stuff.  That's why they bought to be for $440 million to be will immediately expand our direct to consumer audience and capabilities and provide our advertising partners with more opportunities to reach audiences at scale.  Honestly, though, I kind of as somebody who's trying to sell advertising advertisers want to advertise to people who are going to buy.  Otherwise, they're buying ads that are wasted.  There may even be annoying to the people who see them.  It's not an unreasonable thing for an advertiser to say, well, I just want to advertise that people are interested in our product.  And it's not it's not a harm to people.  The problem is not that the problem is if it's extended to other things like, oh, I'm going to also send this information to insurance companies to make sure that Leo doesn't get life insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or I got a great they're going to go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  You know, you go you go on your little delay in the in the sky.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my Internet must be terrible.  It is.  There is.  Yeah.  Or IBM and I think it was Visa or MasterCard was looking at consumption patterns and social media things you post on social media to establish credit scores.  You know, so if you think about like, what if everybody who's watching the Real Housewives doesn't pay their bills on time?  Or what if what if enough people don't want to come on?  Yeah.  Then you suddenly start getting these like weird data scientists are like, oh, this is relevant.  Well, you're only going to be real housewives redlining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like we will not lend money to people watch Real Housewives.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And you're not going to nobody's going to sit at a desk and say, oh, that equals that.  It's just, you know, the correlation is going to be there.  Right.  I'll give you I'll give you a privacy thing that bothered me today.  Right.  So I just got approved for 100 percent paid CPAP for my sleep apnea.  Congratulations.  Well, the data goes right to it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they want to make sure.  And this is the reason why.  And it's hard to quibble with this.  I I'm really torn on this.  Ed is paying for this.  They're putting out money.  So they want to make sure you use it because the health benefits of a CPAP machine accrue if you use it a certain number of hours a week.  Otherwise, they spend a lot of money on something that's just sitting in the corner and they're still going to have to pay for your bad, your bad health outcomes.  So this is one of those cases where I think if it is, I think if the data is.  Stacy.  No, no, no, I think if the data is narrowly, narrowly, it's defined, you opt in and you know exactly what's happening.  I kind of think it's OK.  I don't think they should get the actual health data.  But I do think saying Jeff has worn this is fair data for them to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but they're getting the actual health in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know that's so I want to make clear exactly where.  And that's the hard thing about talking about data sharing is we have to be very clear on what data we're actually sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They require to be worn four hours a night, which alone tells me that nobody can tolerate the damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, people hate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks.  You've not worn it yet.  No, I've gotten it yet.  Well, normally they would send someone to my house, a technician.  Yeah.  I mean, you should definitely double check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes sense.  Usually that is if somebody's been prescribed a CPAP machine and isn't wearing it, the likelihood of death and illness is higher.  That's what insurance companies are trying to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can understand why.  So why don't they have a pill dispenser?  The pill dispenser is a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.  It's a pill dispenser.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a pill dispenser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a pill dispenser.  Right.  So why don't they have a pill dispenser to make sure?  I mean, well, this would be good too.  You know, the old people should have a pill dispenser to take pills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want that, Jeff.  They do.  The problem, I can tell you why, but it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Generally, what's going to happen is these will be voluntary.  It's voluntary, Jeff.  You don't have to take the money.  These are voluntary.  That's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  If you want to pay the whole thing yourself, fine.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get it without the data.  It's voluntary.  And so that's how they get around it.  Nobody's making you take your pills.  Nobody's making you wear a CPAP.  But if you want us to pay for it, you better give us the information that you're wearing  it.  And I don't think that's unreasonable.  The problem is that, you know, what you create is a class structure for privacy.  If you really want privacy, you have to be able to afford it.  Yep.  And if you have to use the insurance to pay for the CPAP machine, well, you don't get  any privacy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is interesting.  Well, I can just...  Just affording and having insurance is kind of a class thing nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Privacy.  Amen.  A lot of things are a luxury.  Privacy is one of them now.  Get ready because the Health and Human Services has built a tool called HHS Protect Now.  It's already up and running as of April 10th.  It helps officials compile reports on coronavirus spread by collecting data from state and local  government, health care institutions and colleges.  We don't know what the data is, but we do know where it's coming from.  Palantir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of people you don't trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Palantir is Peter Thiel's shady company that has been doing this kind of thing for business  for a long time, collecting data from a variety of sources, compiling it.  I don't think they have their own data collection stuff, right?  They just compile it from other sources.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody really knows actually.  Well, I do, but I think this is a case where if the government gets its hands on the app  data, what does Palantir do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Palantir, according to The Verge, has at least two active contracts with Health and Human  Services.  One they signed in January, one less than two weeks ago.  According to The Daily Beast, based on sources with knowledge of the project and confirmation  from HHS itself, the HHS Protect Now platform, which is set to be unveiled later this week,  pulls data from across the federal government, state and local governments, health care  facilities and colleges to help administration officials determine how to mitigate and prevent  spread of the coronavirus.  Well, that seems fine.  187 data sets integrated into the platform.  Hospital capacity and inventory, supply chain data, diagnostic and geographic testing data,  demographic statistics, state policy.  This is what Palantir does.  It takes all these disparate data sources, combines them to give you actionable information.  And let's kill some black people and save some rich people.  That's where you would find that information, though, is that's one of the pieces of information  you could find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so all that information should be public in a way that others could be using it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  HHS is relying on private sector partner contributions of data.  But for a good thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One would hope.  One would hope.  But if it's not, it's an open source question.  So I wrote a piece this week about medicine's open information ecosystem and how we have  things to learn from that.  And I'll go to that in a second.  But one thing the EU is putting out is a data portal where a lot of data, tremendous amounts  of data are going to be available to all researchers.  Now, if that's the case, I know what the data is and I can see where it's being used.  Then I'll have more faith in it.  But if it's being done and decisions are being made with it in the black box of government,  that's what everybody complains about with algorithms.  But now it's our lives at stake.  Death panel!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or pre-crime.  A couple of years ago, Palantir was working with the city of New Orleans to do predictive  policing.  Even city council members didn't know about it.  The city had a contract which they recently terminated after six years with Palantir to  figure out where crimes were going to be committed.  Wow.  Predictive policing.  So this is a kind of stuff Palantir does.  I really don't trust Tom Cruise.  This is the kind of stuff Palantir does.  If minority report style pre-crime policing happens, it's going to happen from companies  like this.  I'm not surprised.  So you want an open...  So you actually wrote a good piece in Medium.  You want an open information ecosystem.  What I'm arguing is that it already is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was fascinating, so I interviewed for...  I have my Twitter list right there, bit.ly slash COVID Twitter list.  And I interviewed four scientists so far who are amazing, which you can find on Buzz Machine.  And as I was listening to them and talking to them about how they operate in two ways,  one is the pre-print servers.  That is to say papers that have not been...  Uh-oh.  Go to Buzz Machine.  I haven't paid my Medium back sheets.  I should have put...  It's on Buzz Machine.  It's there.  You can go to there.  I'm starting to really hate Medium.  I know.  So they have pre-print servers where papers are put up that have not been peer reviewed  yet and have not been published.  And yes, there are problems.  There can be problems with that.  But it's really amazing to see there have been 4,000 COVID papers so far.  Some of them crap, but a hell of a lot of them very useful.  And I looked at...  There's a paper that was done that's very controversial right now in Santa Clara County,  California that looked and argued about the amount...  It was a serology, a blood study to find out how much was...  How prevalent is the virus?  There's much controversy about it.  Well, the same day, five phenomenal epidemiologists and virologists came in and in great detail  on Twitter, criticized the report point by point and its conclusions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The report itself hadn't been peer reviewed, but in a way this is...  Not been peer reviewed.  This is peer reviewed right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is peer reviewed at the speed of the internet.  So I thought about this and I thought, well, yeah, that's what we're all in, is an open  information ecosystem.  So I started off saying that we in journalism and media are no longer the deliverers of  information.  The information is already delivered.  It's already there.  So what do we have to figure out is how do we add value to that?  And what the doctors are doing that's so fascinating to me is they're adapting.  One of the doctors I talked to, Angela Rasmussen from Columbia, said that when she had her  last epidemic, she didn't have pre-prints.  It took a year to get a paper out and get learnings.  Thank God we have this now.  Now, meanwhile, we've had bad papers.  We had the paper about hydroxychloroquine that went out into Twitter and then into Trump's  brain and out his mouth.  And some people have died as a result, it would appear.  But we've also had cases where, but in that case, the doctors were on Twitter saying,  no, bad paper, stop, don't judge this.  Right.  So medical Twitter, social media with the pre-print world is resulting in a phenomenal  ecosystem here of information getting out and getting judged.  So you need some things in that, right?  They needed a way to find, they had to make things open, number one.  Number two, they had to find ways to find the information and organize it.  Number three, they needed a way to criticize it.  Number four, you needed a way to figure out who's really criticizing and are they any  good or not?  Because I've had people, doctors come to me and say, that person, that guy, he doesn't  belong on your list and here's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you see why peer review has always happened offline in the past.  There is a risk, if everything gets published, that people will not be able to weigh, you  know, yeah, sure.  Okay, great.  It got peer reviewed in effect in public on Twitter.  But that doesn't mean that people didn't read the initial report and believe it, the New  York Times published it.  They're not seeing the Twitter takedown of it later.  So there is a risk of doing this all in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  The New York Times today had a piece, I spent two hours this morning doing a tweet storm,  believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or as Carsten called it, a tweet typhoon.  That was me.  Oh, that was you.  Okay.  So I feel like there should be somewhere better than Twitter for all of this to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, that's the that's the you see that no, it's not.  That's the point.  The doctors are using it.  They're using it brilliantly.  They're finding each other.  And in the case of this paper, the New York Times, the New York Times did a horrible story  about that Santa Clara paper saying, well, this guy did it.  And it could mean that could be a little like somebody did.  That's just poor science.  And I went on.  It's bad.  Yeah.  So there's rules.  You shouldn't do pre reporting until you go to at least two or three scientists and ask  who of credentials who give you a different view.  And you include that in.  Now, in the case of this paper, this guy's stuff is being used by the people who are  out there demonstrating like zombies saying, stop this.  It's not necessarily his fault, but they're using it to say, see, this isn't so bad.  And and so they didn't they didn't even Google them.  Right.  The New York Times didn't do its job.  The job should have been here is how epidemiology is being politicized.  Here's what you need to know about it.  And so on.  So I was ready to go and look and say, well, I wonder what San Jose is happening because  San Jose took sports reporters and put them on the covid beat.  Well, I was wrong.  Great report.  Excellent.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, standard among sports reporters is a lot higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was this was a science report.  Just science work.  But but my point is that we're all in this open information ecosystem.  Right.  We've got to it's just it's just there.  You can't do anything about it.  You got to deal with preprints.  You got to deal with social media.  Right.  How do you use it?  Well, and medicine is teaching us how to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so the end of the responsibility of journals of record like the New York Times  is to do their work before they publish.  So, yes, preprints are published without any screening.  But before they republish the information in a preprint, they need to do their job.  Exactly.  And maybe.  I mean, that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But let me let me just throw this out as a working journalist who has worked recently  in what is a very high pressure environment.  You don't always have time.  You're usually working against a this should have been up an hour ago deadline kind of  thing because it just came out an hour ago and somebody else has already issued a broken  news or breaking news.  And what happens is you will try to be calling your sources, but they're also busy.  So I get it.  These things should not be happening.  But this is part of the challenge of doing news in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And right.  And so and so, Stacey, but but but but when we come on the show and there's been a story  that's happened and I've seen something out there and it involves one of your areas of  expertise, I wait to hear what you say about it because you have expertise and I trust  you about that.  And that is your brand.  And you're not going to ruin that.  And and that has value.  Yes.  And what if experts don't agree?  Well, you find the way to express it.  They don't they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They the journalism world is firing people like me left and right because we're expensive.  They bring in.  I know that they bring in so many young people who I mean, and I've trained a lot of young  journalists, you know, and I'm like, oh, you are just not smart, but it's not that  they're not smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why I'm doing this stuff is to try to train them to is to say this is what's out there.  Right.  But they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We put those journalists on GA beats where they're literally rewriting press releases  and then something happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even in this case, Stacey, maybe this is to your point, even the New York Times screwed  it up badly.  Right.  And my point here was it wasn't hard to go on.  There were five epidemiologists with long Twitter, well known people that any science  reporter would know Mark Lipsitch, others.  And it was easy to find them on Twitter.  And there they were within hours had given a peer review and the New York Times ignored

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  them.  So should we not read the New York Times instead read Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in some things, yes.  Oh, God, this was really bad.  I think he's very depressed because I wasn't reading Twitter.  Twitter is not edited at all.  It's on Twitter is not a media brand.  I was reading five great epidemiologists on shows who to read.  Yeah.  Twitter is not a thing.  When the media says Twitter says that is the greatest lie of all.  Twitter doesn't say a thing.  Right.  Right.  That's an old man should be a way to look the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who's one to remember the immortal words of Stacom?  Friendly reminder in times of uncertainty and misinformation, anecdotes are not data.  Good data is carefully measured and collected information based on a range of subject dependent  factors, including but not limited to controlled variables, meta analysis and randomization.  Let's not forget.  Let's not forget.  Stacom didn't forget.  You shouldn't forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I in my Twitter story today, I said, listen, I'm not a science reporter.  I'm a guy who retweets Stacom's ad admirably.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And rate my room on Skype.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, you've been leading me to the zeitgeist lately.  I really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what this show is.  Oh, my God.  That's what we're supposed to be.  This week in zeitgeist.  We named it wrong.  Oh, it's twizz.  I want that t-shirt.  We're rebranding the whole damn thing.  Well, can we get a new theme song with it, please?  Yes.  We'll get a new theme song.  It's not going to be this week in Munchutz.  It'll be this week in zeitgeist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, by the way, I didn't know that Jason writes music.  Oh, yeah.  So I said, can you please write us a damn theme song?  Well, Willie, we should get a better theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I admit it.  We should.  I like reporters as much as the next guy.  Yeah, we don't hear it.  The audience hears it.  We don't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if we have Deep Mind because they do have a composing thing?  We'll just have Deep Mind compose something for us.  There's nothing more appropriate.  Jason would be insulted.  It will be weird.  It will be weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  Let's take a little break for our one and only fine advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we shall bless you as Steakham says, bless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steakham bless.  Our show today brought to you by this week in Google, brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  By the way, I should, as parenthetically mentioned, many of our employees are also brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  We use them and love them.  But here's a message they sent.  Right now, we cannot be overwhelmed.  We have to work to keep our loved ones safe and protect our communities.  We have to work to stay strong, to stay connected, to stay focused.  We have to work to inspire, to innovate, to build new solutions.  But for all of this to work, we have to work together.  At ZipRecruiter, we connect employers and people every day.  But today is different.  We're partnering with first responders, government officials, the medical community, the innovators, and the manufacturing, transportation, and food distribution industries.  We want to make sure we're finding the right people for the right jobs right now.  Let's work together.  And the website is ZipRecruiter.com slash work together.  I kind of admire this.  I really need some nice piano music behind it, some dramatic piano music.  But you get the idea.  ZipRecruiter.com slash work together, especially if you're looking for people in these vital industries right now.  ZipRecruiter is great.  ZipRecruiter.com slash work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you, ZipRecruiter.  Thank you.  Thank you for not running away from the topic as a sponsor, from being around and recognizing we're all in this together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a challenge because, of course, you don't want to be a downer in an ad.  I'm seeing on TV a lot of, and that's why I said the piano music.  They all have the same.  Somebody's writing piano music, making a lot of money for the dramatic.  Jason.  Wiley Jason.  Maybe that's what we need, some dramatic piano music, right?  But you see a lot of those ads.  My favorite is the Uber ad.  Have you seen the Uber ad?  No.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if I can play it without.  I'm not a snob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just don't like to watch.  Let me ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a delayed reaction.  Let me ask Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I can I play the Uber ad here?  This is from Ad Age.  This is the Uber ad.  I'll play it a little bit, but I'll play it like in a little window.  There's the piano music.  Very important.  Kind of the minor key.  People looking out a window, waving.  They're all sheltering at home.  They're sad.  They're eating on their roof.  They've got a dog, but nothing much else.  Look, she's handling the box with tongs.  They're zooming each other.  Oh, they've turned their house into a playground for the children.  Playing frisbee, washing foods, dancing.  This is the Uber ad.  There's no cars in the Uber ad.  There's just a lot of people at home, actually.  Somebody painting a heart on their window.  A dog licking yoga.  People, which dogs do, eating the toilet paper.  There she is giving her husband a shave.  That's not going to happen, Lisa.  They're hugging.  She's pregnant.  She's looking out the window.  A lot of people looking out the window now.  Now there's a little baby looking out the window.  There's an old man looking out the window.  And then stay home for everyone who can't.  Thank you for not riding with Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the nicest thing Uber has done.  It's a wild ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for not riding with Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see I put in the rundown chat, Dove's courage is beautiful.  Dove's always been good on that kind of thing.  Dove's been good on this.  So Dove, this is the poor health care workers who have to wear these masks  and wear all this stuff and their faces just get mangled by it.  So they need to use Dove Beauty products.  No, no, no, no.  Don't be cynical.  No, I'm not cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be cynical when it comes to Dove.  Well, that's what Steakhams will tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steakhams says, always remember I'm a brand.  I'm trying to sell you frozen meat product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's good brands.  But there's good brands.  All of our sponsors, for instance, are good brands.  They are indeed.  I love you.  I know you wrote this, Jeff.  Snooty Times Journos ask, is Twitter good?  And it's a panel discussion among really mostly cooking and style columnists  at the New York Times about, is Twitter good again?  Kind of, yeah.  I don't want to spook it by writing about this.  I think part of it is just the absence of feeling of dread  that you should be doing something better with your life.  You know, every time I read Twitter, and I got to just follow different people,  I guess, I get depressed.  It's depressing for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't follow enough corgi columns.  Or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that's going to help.  You know, Twitter is like wonderful for pictures of dogs and adorable things and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then the bad stuff sneaks in too.  Well, I mean, that's the way the world is.  Yeah, but I don't need to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like when you're meditating, you choose what to focus on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're like, I see this and I'm letting that go.  I see this. I will embrace it.  So, okay, let's just do a little sample of my Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elon Musk tweets, there are now 420 operational Starlink satellites.  Let's help you here.  Unfollow Elon Musk. Let's start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to point this out.  That sounds like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do follow board Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do actually follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this sounds like just, oh, that's cool.  They've got 420.  And then you realize 420 is code for marijuana smoking.  And so he's doing a marijuana joke.  Okay, you're right.  Unfollow.  Okay, all right.  You're right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, the air fixes up.  Now, wait, wait, wait. While you do that, you're going to replace it with a corgi.  You got to replace it with a corgi feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time a Twitter feed dies, a corgi gets its wings.  Okay.  Yes.  So I'm just going to search for corgis.  I'm not a fan of corgis, but all right.  Here's this.  Here's this guy.  My corgi name Duke.  From Eduardo Aroles.  That is not a corgi, but it is adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It isn't a corgi, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is...  Even corgi Twitter is full of liars.  That's not a corgi either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A corgi smeared with jam and passed out.  On the floor.  After eating too much jam.  Okay.  See?  Okay.  Now these are corgis.  A group of corgis is called a corganization.  Okay, I'm not following corgi stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you feel better now?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's another one that I like.  VCs congratulating themselves.  Quoting my hero, Paul Graham.  That's by the way a good feed.  This is Paul Graham.  Within YC, we effectively  reinvented last names.  So many founders  share the same first names that we started saying,  for example, Steve from Reddit.  Which is exactly what  Steve de Reddit means in French.  Or Steve von Reddit in German.  Okay, Paul Graham is usually a little more profound than that.  Okay. There's Father Robert.  He thinks he is.  He's got MFing snakes in his MFing  broadband box.  Yeesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they love that there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to slow it down.  Oh, Peter Frampton. 70 years old.  Peter apparently doesn't know how to use Twitter.  His quote is cut off.  But I'll click it so we get the whole thing.  Peter Frampton comes alive.  Okay, fine.  How things work. This is how machine learning  checks if you're social distancing properly.  See, this is good. This is probably somebody  from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you follow Quanta magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Quanta magazine.  See these people?  They're red. Look at all the red boxes.  These people are bad.  So what do we do? We get Robocop?  Right. See, I walk next to my wife  because I've already got  her germs.  I don't know.  And then there's Trump, which I don't want to see.  Okay. Joel, a friend.  I know art when I see it.  It's a helicopter chase on this freeway.  The 405.  There's my friend Ant.  So that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From Stacom.  Chris Hayes is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Chris Hayes. He's one of those  MSNBC guys. Jim Acosta  from CNN,  right?  He's a White House correspondent for CNN.  Can we ask Fauci what he thinks of possible  second wave during flu season?  Why is he asking this on Twitter?  Jim, you're in the briefing.  Why are you asking this on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why? Why?  So what was happening was Redfield,  the head of the CDC, I think,  was we were being on. I don't have the sound on.  But I'm guessing he had to be, he had to walk  the plank as Fauci did before.  Poor Fauci.  Because Redfield said the second wave is going to be worse.  And Trump was enraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trump is enraged should be the Twitter  motto.  All right.  I don't follow Trump.  I don't follow him, but you can't avoid him.  I don't follow him, but you can't avoid him.  You retweet him sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually will. I refuse to follow him.  I will get angry and scream at  him. But that's why somebody is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like you get Trump in my  feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like Twitter.  Well, Ant did a  you know, a filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I should only follow Ant.  That's what I should do.  That's the filter.  This is scary, but it's okay.  I'm going to consider the source, which is a very progressive  left leaning  publication called In These Times.  The head of the postal workers  union says the postal service could be dead  in three months.  Yeah, that's old.  June. No, this is April 16th,  2020. The postal service  can't. No, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sorry, the story is that  they were talking about it when Trump  as part of the CARES Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's going to be money for the postal service?  No, there's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He denied it. So they were like, well,  then the postal service will shut down by June.  So the  story itself is not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. So I shouldn't worry about it.  The postal service is going to be  just fine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people did buy stamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean. If the postal service  is gone, that stamp is worthless.  I just want to point out  FedEx and UPS are not  going to honor your postal service stamp.  We will still have  I think we constitutionally, don't we have  to? Isn't it in the US Constitution  of the United States of America  that there shall be? Well, what does that mean anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're supposed to have three arms of  government too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zoom.  Okay. You say I'm angry, Stacy.  Yes, I know. See, that's why I'm angry.  I'm going to listen to this show because it's like more Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's leave Twitter.  Let's go back to talking about  Do we have a change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, Jeff?  Do you have the drummers and those  horn guys? Bring them in. Let's do  the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you play a trumpet with a mask on? That's a hard  thing. It's not well played. Listen, you can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's quite well done.  Google change log.  Google has added a feature. I don't know.  Do you want this? It's rolling  out slowly. You're going to change  the sensitivity  of the Hey Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I 100% do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your Google responding too quickly?  No, it's not responding  fast enough. Oh, you want to turn up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the sensitivity? Oh, you want to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh. Yeah, because I  walk downstairs and there's one. I don't know what  it is about the acoustics or  I don't know, but I'm always constantly  I'm right next to it. I'm like, Hey, G,  what's the weather? Because it's right by my front door

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  before I walk the dog. So I'm like, coat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No coat. And it's I always have  to like shout it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is not available  to everybody. When it is available,  it will be on the app  in the privacy section.  It's got a new settings page.  You got a little slider, a  little slider. You  got in the middle, you got default.  In the left, you got least sensitive.  In the right, you got most sensitive and that's per  speaker. So I could  see that you would want this maybe if you've got a  speaker in the living room that's always waking up with a  TV show, you would make it less sensitive.  And then for you, when you walk the dog,  the one nearest there, you'd make  it more sensitive. Does that  mean, I  don't know what more sensitive means though.  Like it's listening harder?  No, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  assume it will be less  discriminatory. It might  generate more false positives. I'll see if I can turn it on and tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question.  That's a good answer.  Google Fi is getting eSIM support.  That means  you can use it on your  new iPhone.  I don't think it will still do  the Google  the secret sauce of Fi is that  it goes between T-Mobile,  Sprint, US Cellular or Wi-Fi  depending on what works better.  I don't know if you have to  have special hardware to do that  or not, but at least you don't  need a SIM.  You can set it up  by going online.  Which is nice. And that's a feature of  all the iPhones is they have  eSIMs. No physical SIM.  And Google Fi  is a very good choice for data, actually.  I think. I have it on my  iPad. But I put a SIM in.  But I guess I don't have to anymore. So that's nice.  In

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for example, India, they  have mostly phones with  two SIMs. Does the iPhone in India have  two SIMs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I think they have a dual SIM iPhone for India.  You kind of have to in India  because the areas  covered by carriers, first of all there are many  many carriers, and the areas covered are  small. So it's not unusual  at all that you would have different carriers depending on  where you are in your neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Facebook  we'll get back to it in a second.  Facebook spent a fortune investing in  Indian book companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  There is an old adage  that no computer program  is ever really done until  it can fetch email.  Google Meet  is adding Gmail integration.  Just what you needed.  Grid layout and improved  low lighting quality and  more meat, of course, is the  app that is getting a lot of usage.  We do a lot of Google Meetings now.  It's been crap for me.  It's not as good as Zoom.  And by the way,  I should mention, Zoom has really  gone the extra mile  to improve security.  They just released version 5.0.  As we mentioned last week, Alex  Stamos, well known head of security  at Yahoo and Facebook. Don't blame him  for all the bad stuff that happened.  He says, but  he came in as a consultant. They hired  a former Microsoft security  person who's really good. Is it  Katie Massura? She's very, very, very good.  They're  doing, they've rewritten, they're  really working on improving their security.  So I feel like  Zoom, because it is the easiest  to use and because everybody you know  wants to use Zoom, it was really  important. It's an opportunity for Zoom.  And the good news is they took it seriously  and they seem to have done that. I had a two and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hour call with somebody in Vienna.  And her sound kept  going off.  I couldn't figure out what it was. Her video was fine.  I don't know if it was Zoom or  her machine. It was very  weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube is going to, YouTube  Music, which is replaced in many  cases Google Music, and if it hasn't yet  it will for you,  has added a new tab.  Explore.  Explore.  So I have  subscribed, in fact I'll do it right now, I've subscribed  to Google Music forever  and all of the features I guess  are slowly migrating over.  Let me see, oh I don't  have the new tab yet. I don't have an  explore tab.  But maybe someday soon I will.  Music  Discovery is actually a fairly important  thing. One of the things,  Spotify keeps winning, not because  they have more songs, everybody's got the same libraries  roughly. Not  because maybe of the user interface, but because  of their playlist capability, which people love.  And I think  because of the Discover Weekly playlist  that they make every week for you, so you can  discover new music. I think that's a really important  part of any  music service and Google's  probably looking over their shoulder  at Spotify saying how can we be more like  them. This will replace the now defined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in Spotify,  I was going to say they were  first with lots of integrations.  Remember how you used to only get  Google music in like Google-y  places? So  I think that's another advantage as an independent  purveyor of streaming  music and having the  widest catalog for a while.  I think that's kind of  that helped it.  I'm going to run down a rat hole real quickly here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then I'll get back to the  change log. But Sonos,  which was the king of all this,  has announced they're going to do a radio  station.  Sonos Radio, it's a free streaming  music service. It has a lot of  radio stations. They're going to combine  not all, but many of the radio  stations on iHeart and CBS  and Radio.com.  They'll also have their own  Beats 1 style station. Apple  has a station on their music thing  that will  play music. Again, this is I think is about  Discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor Sonos people.  Still trying to find some value in that overpriced  speaker. Customers can listen  worldwide, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  via the Sonos app on their Sonos devices  and will be located in the  global radio stations  available for our customers. Sonos  is original programming will be available in the US,  Canada, UK, Ireland and Australia  starting yesterday.  So I'll have to try it. It's available now.  There'll also be  ad free artist stations,  kind of Pandora style.  The first station will be  centered around, oh too bad, Radiohead  frontman Tom York.  Is that okay, Jeff?  He's okay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that would appeal to a lot of  Beats, most buyers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably Radiohead. We love it.  Brittany Howard of Alabama  Shakes, I like them. David Byrne, love him.  And Third Man Records  are going to be new artist stations launching regularly.  So that's just a side, it's not a Google.  It's not a Google, but it's a  new online related to the new explore tab  in YouTube music. And finally  the Google Play Store is pushing  health and fitness apps.  And Android TV  gets a stay mindful  and fit row. I don't know  anybody uses Android TV. I do, I have a shield.  So there's a new row.  The whole thing is organized around rows.  It'll be a get mindful and fit  row. You know there is actually a good  reason to do that. See, look at that. You got your Peloton.  You got your dance fitness with Jessica.  These are all I think mostly paid.  But anyway, there it is.  Your home.  Your stay mindful and fit row.  It is the case, I believe  that your prognosis  if you get COVID, and aren't we all going to  get it eventually, is better if  you are fit.  And you do a lot of aerobic  exercise so your lungs are strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do it.  And that,  get the drums.  Drummers, stop smoking. It's time.  Get off your break. That's  the Google change lock.  What a kettle drum.  Now we can  talk about the big acquisition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from Facebook. Well, not even  an acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they only have 10%  of it. 10% for a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  money. But for 5.7  billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. What is this thing  that they bought?  Phone company. It's a phone company.  About 10% of a phone company.  Which is an affiliate  of the largest company in India.  And the thinking is  that they acquired, is it  GEO, is that how you pronounce it?  They acquired GEO because they  want to beef up. They didn't acquire it, they got 10%.  I'm sorry.  They weren't me. Invested.  In GEO because  of online payments.  And right now they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  building WeChat, is what they're doing  for India. That's right.  And they are not a big player yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not a big player yet. So they gotta do some  acquis, I'm sorry,  investments.  Investments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want an acquisition,  acquire it at a minority stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They acquired a minority stake. 10% is not that much.  But it was a lot of money.  It's a freaking lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the biggest cash haul  that Facebook, how much did they get  on Instagram for? 1 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instagram was 1 billion. No, the biggest one was  WhatsApp. They spent 22 billion.  Depending on the stock price,  a lot of money on WhatsApp.  This is only a mere 5.7 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to be fair, WhatsApp was their chance  to be like WeChat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point, Stacy.  Maybe they're kind of making these  first of all, they got the money, right?  5 billion, big deal.  And they need to get these partnerships  going so that they can make WhatsApp,  which is already popular in India,  but they want to make it the full featured payment  thing. And there's other companies already in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I saw speculation  today that Lyft's price is  down so far that Google has to buy it  tomorrow. Of course, it's a speculation.  But is it a point,  there must be some real bottom  line for the companies that are feeding opportunities now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  There's tons. I mean, this is the time when lots of people  in the IOT world, we're seeing lots of companies  that do  drone based or remote  not monitoring, but going to view things  like analysis and checking into  stuff. That is off the charts  high because a lot of firms are looking to  buy assets. And so they're trying to get  a sense of, you know, the quality  of those assets because  it's time to come in and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, I am being  chided  chided, I say, by the chat room  no, by the chat room for having  missed so many important change log items.  I'll do them real quickly. Fortnite  is now on the Play Store. Remember for  a while Epic Games said we're  going to side load this. They've given  up. They're going to give Google their 30%  because it's so important to be on the Play Store.  YouTube has debuted  a new slate of With Me originals  during the coronavirus  pandemic.  I don't know what With Me is. It's the  hashtag With Me campaign.  For instance, the creator games  presented by MrBeast  will be a live event with a  popular YouTuber. I never heard of him, but  okay, MrBeast challenges others  on the platform to compete in games  from their respective homes. Another  example, Stay Home with  Young Blood,  a weekly series that follows a singer-songwriter  in a rental apartment where he's quarantined  with four friends.  Oh, God. Celebrity Substitute  is a distance learning show  which brings in celebrities like Carly  Klaus and Ken Jeong to cheat, teach  lessons about subjects such as coding  and biology. I wonder which of the  two Carly Klaus is teaching.  There's a lot of these things.  We're doing a thing on Friday  I should mention, 4pm Pacific,  7pm Eastern time.

You can't play Tiger King, but you see  a screen of boxes.  That plugin lets you play  it in sync. The old ideas people get together, families  get together, watch a movie together.  Kind of like zooming at the same  time. But this extension  does it for you. Google Store  has refreshed product categories with Pixel  Nest, Stadia, and Pixelbook brands.  This is the  Rump Google  change log provided by ScooterX  in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're going to  have Jeff just do a little finger drumming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Phones are now Pixel.  Connected Home is now Nest.  Gaming is now, so they put brands on all  the categories. See the difference?  Laptops and tablets are now Pixelbook.  So they're just putting  their brands up there instead of the generic  headers. I don't know  what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't call this major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, okay,  I admit I missed it.  Google has added a  universal watch list  for movies and TVs  to Google search.  So  mobile users can first  search what to watch to get Google's  suggestions organized at the top  of search results.  And then you can filter it by show.  Here's what it looks like. It's on your mobile.  So you search  for what to watch and then you'll get some  suggestions.  I don't know if that's any better than  any other what to watch thing.  But okay.  Maybe Google's got more information  and it'll propose stuff really good.  I feel like there's a lot of these recommendations.  I even get it on  YouTube TV. So maybe that's what it is.  Maybe it's the YouTube TV version.  Okay. And now that's the  Rump Google change log.  Yeah, Rump.  Am I  misusing that term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  If you have a  meeting after a larger meeting,  that's called the Rump

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Session. A meeting held after the Rump Session is.  So that was the Rump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have never heard of this. How interesting.  I've heard it for years after the meeting was adjourned.  The tail end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yes, that's why it is the Rump.  That makes sense. But it's the bit after  the bigger bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The person you don't like leaves and then you get  the real business done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're going to do from now on a Rump change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it'll never end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll wait until I leave  and then do a Rump

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  twig or twiz.  All right.  I want to wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's after this one.  I won't be here. And it's after this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where the hell are you going? You can't go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm getting my Botox shots.  I could come back with Botox and COVID.  By the way,  she doesn't do this for vanity, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's just a very tense person.  And if I did do it for vanity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's just fine.  Right. But look at her forehead.  It's seamless anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  She has no lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although right now I have nothing because  my video is so blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can't see anything.  It's for your migraines.  So good luck.  I want to  now  do the Rump twig,  which is where we do the Stacy's thing,  Jeff's number,  and Leo's tool.  Starting with

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stacy's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy's looking around like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh, I don't have a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to have a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last week I had two things, but let me  tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me do my thing because it's a thing you would like.  Oh, do your thing. Yeah.  One of the engineers at Twilio,  Christina Sunu,  she's in the IoT developer community.  See, this is right up your alley.  She's going to be on my show next week.  Oh, so my thing is your thing.  She decided to build  a data tracker for an  internet connected sourdough  starter.  This is genius.  Twilio, it turns out, I didn't realize this, they have an IoT  developer kit.  And so she used that.  It uses Twilio narrowband,  which uses the cell signal.  She says, why did I do that? Well, because your  Wi-Fi maybe isn't perfectly reliable.  It doesn't use a lot of data. It's not very  expensive. You can get a Twilio account  fairly, that's free, I think, and the developer  kit. And then you'll need a  LiPo battery. You'll need an Arduino.  And you'll need the  sourd,  s-o-u-r-d dot i-o  github repo.  You also  need an MQTT broker of choice.  And you have to be, I'm sorry, in the U.S.  No sourdough outside  of the U.S. allowed. But this  is, you know, I mean, honestly, I don't  anticipate a lot of people doing this.  But it's pretty cute, because what you want to do  with your sourdough, you need to monitor  temperature, moisture,  and most importantly, size.  And this does all of that.  The humidity produced  as the yeast respirates is delightfully  detectable, she says.  We can actually, should we look at our monitor?  Let's just see if we can see how  our sourdough is going. Oh!  Look at that. The humidity is  spiking.  Temperature is very consistent. Well done,  Christina.  Distance, which I guess is how much it's grown,  is field chart  three. I think her sourdough  is at a peak  performance right now.  But the bread monitor, nothing's happening,  because I guess she doesn't, she's not baking right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She probably has not made bread yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. She's too busy  making sourdough monitors.  I think this is  exactly what engineers  do when they're  stuck at home.  They make sourdough  bread monitors. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's coming on the show next  week, not just to talk about this,  but to actually talk about how  any of us, you know, I know  a lot of people who go and buy  pies or Arduinos, myself  included. And I'm like, yeah,  I'm going to hook this up and do something with it.  And then I'm like,  so she's going to  help us get over that hump. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty cool what she did. And I imagine  a 3D printer  would help a little bit for the enclosure.  It goes right there on top  of your sourdough, which by the way,  Christina is looking mighty fine.  Mighty fine.  There you go.  She's planning another bread monitor in the future  that connects with Super Sim, which  is worldwide. So stay tuned.  Stay tuned. I like  Twilio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they were a sponsor of my show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love them a lot.  I love them a lot. In fact, I've met

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  some of their engineers. This was like a year and a half  ago. But, you know, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nice.  Jeff, do you have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  number? Well, I could do something boring  like telling you that Netflix has  almost 16 million new subscribers  double what they expected so everybody  can watch Tiger King with Leo.  But instead, remember earlier I  said, we can't say that  Twitter says this or Twitter says that. Well, according  to Fox News, Twitter  is going berserk over the discovery  something you can make in your thermal  mix, Leo. Yes.  White Castle Pate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is White Castle Pate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the most disgusting  thing going through my  grandma's church recipe book.  10 White Castle hamburgers, water  and sour cream for  topping. Blend burgers in blender,  which is where you do it, or in a  thermal mix, a few at  a time. Adding water is needed  for a thick, hard, quotes  dough. Spread  into lightly greased loaf pan  or round mold. Bake at  325 for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool  and unmold. Serve with crackers  and sour cream.  Actually, it's probably delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, if I'm going to do  any blending, I'm going to blend some  speculoos cookies and make speculoos  butter. Is that not the best thing you've ever had?  The best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the speculoos is a  little too sweet. It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  too sweet. It is. But it's still  delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, I want  to vomit now, but  I found a thing for y'all.  I always forget stuff like this.  But, I figured  this is more of a Leo thing,  but since Leo did a Stacey thing, I feel  okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.  We all know about Rosetta  at Home and Folding at Home.  Both projects trying to take proteins  and analyze them on behalf of science  for COVID-19. So, everybody  is like, yeah, I'm going to do this now.  Yay. But you can  only do it on PCs. Until  Balena,  they are a container management  software for IoT companies,  they actually ported this to Arm.  So, now you can do these jobs  on a Pi or not on  Arduino. You do need some pretty  significant memory. But now you can  do it on some of your random,  let's say you bought a Pi and you thought you were going to  make a sourdio,  sourdio thing.  But instead, you were like,  I'll do it later. Right now, you can just  put it to work doing some folding at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With your old laptop or Raspberry. I do  have a spare Raspberry Pi.  Of course you do. This is a small  network right now, only 1221 computers.  Maybe we can add to it.  It's fold for COVID  .io. Fold  for COVID.  .io.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know somebody who's going to put that to use in another way.  Oh, yeah? Or bring in other people to  contribute. Yeah.  So, let me ask you because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean,  why not? Except that  is this really helping  anything? This folding at home  or Rosetta because it is using  a lot of power.  Like a lot.  Yeah, I know it's the most powerful computer ever.  But is it, I mean,  is anything coming of this or are we just all  just kind of burning candles

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the darkness? Well, they're  assigning jobs and analysis.  So there is a central unit that's assigning  people to look at various parts.  So, if, I mean, the idea  is that everybody  looks at all this stuff  and their spare time. Maybe you'll find something.  Maybe we'll find something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like SETI at home found all those aliens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe  there are no aliens to find or maybe they don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to be found. Okay. So it's, yeah, I'm all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you want to be found by us?  No. You want to hide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe we don't want to be  found. Let's be real. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if it's, I don't know that people  put this together. It used to be at Stanford  and then some guy took it and now it's somewhere else  and I just, I want  it to be good and useful.  But it is using a non-trivial  amount of electricity.  So as long as it's good,  you can... So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my friend who wants to  bring this to another arena to get  shared computing power, and I were talking  about this, and  you know, I mentioned  things like efforts  to deal with analyzing  genomes  of COVID.  The computing power  could be useful. Maybe it's  just using computer. Oh, it is using  computing power.  I have seen, there was a company at CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that used computing power to like  heat people's homes while folding.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Karsten.  He sent me a subreddit. There's great subreddits  on Reddit and this is one I actually  follow called AskScience.  And this was posted eight years  ago, but okay.  You know, folding at home has been around for 20 years.  Has folding at home really  accomplished anything? And a response  again, eight years ago from  a guy who does unequivocally  yes, I do drug discovery.  One important part is knowing the molecular  target, which requires precise knowledge of structural  elements of complex proteins.  By the way, that's the same kind of thing we have to solve  with COVID-19.  Some of these are solved by X-ray crystallography,  but folding at home has solved several  knotty problems for proteins  that are not amenable to this approach.  Bottom line is, we are actively  designing drugs based on the solutions  of folding at home.  And that's just in my particular  research. So. And then there's another guy with  cancer drug discovery.  He says, sometimes  you really need sheer computing  power, and that's what you get from these  giant, you know,  clusters of computing.  So, I'm going to amend my  cynical  comments and say, yes, it's worth  doing. So, fold for COVID.  Well, there is someone actually in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the comments talking about what you talked about.  Maybe it's not the most efficient  way of going about this, but it's the way  we have because all of our super efficient  supercomputers are already doing other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're busy doing other things.  You know, going through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're modeling climate change. Yeah, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am going to end the show  with a  fine tweet from Rex  Chapman.  Quarantine  stuntmen.  Are you ready for two minutes and 17 minutes  of stuntmen who don't have any movies to be  in? Watch and enjoy.  Ladies and gentlemen, that  concludes this episode  of This Week in Rump  Google.  Thank you  for joining me.
