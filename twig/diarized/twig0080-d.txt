I am Becky Worley and this is This Week in Google.  Joining us, thank God, in Leo's absence, we have the regulars, Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.  Gina, welcome.  Hey, how are you?  Good to be here.  I like, we watched the Android event earlier this morning and noticed the trend of the  t-shirt with the jacket over.  And so I really like that you are sporting that look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  I broke out the Don Johnson jacket over my HTML5 t-shirt and it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are just continuing the fashion trend.  Also a fashionista joining us, Jeff Jarvis.  He, oh, is apparently sponsored by Nike.  Very impressive.  By way of acting like I ever sweat and exercise.  You all know who Jeff is.  He wrote the book, What Would Google Do?  And of course from buzzmachine.com.  Jeff, thanks so much for coming back from the Davos and sharing your wisdom here.  I'm sure we'll talk a little bit about that and Eric Schmidt making his presence known  there.  And then we are lucky enough to be joined by Joel Johnson of Gizmodo.  Joel, welcome to the show.  You and me, we're newbies.  Can we handle it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  I think so.  And you are very lucky.  I appreciate you pointing that out.  I didn't know how to bring that up myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Good.  We will also be talking about Eric Schmidt with you because I loved your post of what  Eric Schmidt's TV show might look like if he does actually go into television as his  profession.  So we'll get to that later in the show.  We want to start with a story that started to break yesterday and it feels like it has  some legs in it.  Google claims that Bing is copying its search results.  So let me see if I can summarize this and you guys weigh in on this as it happens.  So basically what happened is that the folks at Google started noticing that strange misspelled  words and Google takes pride in the idea that their algorithm for finding the correct result  for misspelled words is better than anybody else's.  So what they noticed was that some strange misspelled words were bringing back on Bing  the same results that those same misspelled words were bringing back on Google.  And then they started noticing about a month later, and this all kind of started last fall,  that the top 10 results for many, many of the pages were getting more and more similar,  that there was a huge spike in how similar all the results were for Bing and for Google  in the first, the top 10 results.  So what Google did is they set up a sting.  They basically created a honeypot, if you will, where they created what they called  synthesized search results.  They created words that have no meaning, MZZVDLRGY, and then they forced results for that word.  They told their engineers to go home and using Internet Explorer and the Bing toolbar to  try to search for those exact made-up phrases, and then they monitored Bing for those phrases  to see what happened, and they found big similarities.  So to the panel, the assertion is Bing copying Google.  It's proven.  The sting operation proved it.  Do we buy that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sure looks like it.  The post on Google and Google is normally so circumspect, and so we don't talk about  our competitors and we're nice guys and we like all of them, but it was fairly damning.  There's some argument that says that they're just using the data that they get from their  browser and that, well, so happens that people search Google and that's how they learn from  it.  But I don't buy that fully, and I think that for a one-time or a 10-time response, it looked  pretty suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, do you think that it's cut and dried, or is this something that's got a lot of wiggle  room and that everybody in the industry kind of cribs off each other's notes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's a lot of wiggle room here, and I was really surprised by the way that  Google officially and publicly framed this as stealing.  For a company that its entire business is based around analyzing users' clickstream  and making their results and showing them more relevant results, it surprised me that  they didn't know that the Bing toolbar was analyzing users' clickstreams and using that  clickstream, watching what people click and incorporating that information back into their  search results.  I don't know.  I mean, I think that that's kind of standard practice.  I could see why Google's upset that those search terms were so exact that it seemed  like such an exact copy.  But at the same time, this all kind of came out after a rash of articles about how Google's  search results were becoming less relevant and how Bing was getting so much better.  So I kind of wish that Google had said, hey, you know, Bing's getting a lot better because  they're using signals from us versus saying they stole, they're copying our search results.  So I felt like I wish that they would have handled this a little better.  They're more aggressive and assertive, and the post was a lot more damning, I think,  than it should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm putting it in a post now.  Edwin Lau, is that his name?  You got it wrong?  Defense of Bing on this saying just that in Quora, Edwin Lau, who worked on Google search  is defending them.  So I'm putting that on the rundown now.  We can put it in the show notes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's been a lot of people who sort of a backlash.  Rob Enderly was quoted in a post saying it's crazy for Google to go after Bing like this  because so much of their history has been about looking at other people's results.  And, you know, in this business, you'd be nuts not to be comparative.  And the word that's interesting to me that seems to be pretty loaded is signals.  You used it, Gina, that it's just, you know, all of the data points you can collect.  And if one of those data points is your competitor's results, how where is the ethics line?  Where does this get, you know, everybody's got their panties in a bunch.  And I don't know if, Joel, you caught this yesterday, this kind of smackdown that happened  at the it was what was it?  It was the Bing's Future of Search event.  And there was a Google guy, Matt Cutts, and then Harry Shum from Bing.  And they they really kind of got testy with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cutts is an engineer, but he kind of acts as a de facto public PR guy.  I honestly don't understand if I were running Bing and Google was out there and I could  I could just do mass searches within Google and have not a real time, but at least a sort  of real time sense of what their returns were.  Why wouldn't I incorporate that into my database for my search engine?  Like, you know, you can go to get a Google results page right now.  It doesn't say copyright at the bottom of Google.  Like the results, especially like you were saying earlier, for something that is based  around indexing other people's information.  I don't see why Google shouldn't be indexing Bing and Bing shouldn't be indexing Google  and then waiting all those results to make their engines better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not just the index, Joel.  It's the analysis.  It's why something appears on top.  And that is more proprietary.  That is, in fact, the end result of the page rank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not copying that.  I mean, they could sort of reverse engineer the algorithm in it.  Once they have all the data, they can get a they can get an approximation of it.  But if they're just a proc or if they're just grabbing the results of that algorithm, I  don't see how there is any problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's that's the peanut butter sandwich.  That's it.  The results are are the value.  And you know, I'm trying to think of analogs here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If the analogs are almost I'm sorry, I interrupt you.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying that if I bring it to your world, if your competitor were reading you  all day and just putting your headlines up and or not bring links to you, just just take  taking your scoops and then redoing it, you'd be pissed with the ads on the side, getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the ad revenue from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You say that like that hasn't happened to me.  I know.  Constantly.  Yeah.  I mean, I would feel a lot more pity for another company besides Google.  But Google has built.  That's not fair.  It's because they're big.  It's totally.  It's because they built their company around indexing other the culture.  So they've and which is great and valuable.  And I think it is a good thing.  But this is totally what's good for the goose is good for the gander sort of situation where  they're you know, they've said for years, oh, we're indexing these books.  But you know, we're not going to worry about having to pay the license fees and the whole  author's guild debacle, which I tend to decide with Google on that.  But they can't then turn around and say, well, somebody's indexing our information and we're  using a proprietary algorithm so it shouldn't be indexed.  I mean, the same reason that they feel they have the right to index other people's creations  is the same reason they shouldn't complain when somebody indexes theirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also wonder if the metric is a little off here.  So Microsoft in its defense issued this very oblique statement saying, well, we use thousands  of different signals to create our results and, you know, not exactly categorically saying  that they don't use Google results.  And Mary Jo Foley pressed them and said, yes or no, do you steal Google's results?  And they said, no, we don't steal them.  But then when you look at the sting, it seems so black and white.  But here's the thing, if they use thousands of signals and there's a made up word that  has no data points on it, except for the one data point coming out of the IE Bing toolbar  feedback and this are users who have opted in to share information, then the results  are going to be exact because that's the only data point that they're getting on this BS  keyword.  So maybe also the issue is that the sting makes them look guiltier than they actually  are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the sting is flawed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how Google has positioned this.  And that's what Gina, I believe, was saying earlier is, you know, they do have a legitimate  point.  And if they it's like they took a really good PR opportunity to say, hey, you know, being  so horrible that they have to copy our search results just to compete with our with our engine  and instead, you know, got all freaked out and were like, oh, no, being we set up this  sting operation.  And I think they expected everybody to instantly side with them and be like, how dare Microsoft  do that?  But again, I feel like a lot of people feel like Google is the last company in the world  that needs to make those claims.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And ironically, Microsoft used to be the big bad wolf.  Now everyone's kind of siding with them like, hey, ease off Microsoft.  They're just trying to compete.  The other thing that Rob Enderle said is that the backlash on that front that really may  bite Google in the butt is that if their assertions get the attention of federal regulators who  are saying, hmm, does this does this mandate that we need to come in here and take a look  at this?  Does this industry need to be regulated?  Google is the last company that wants that kind of scrutiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody in the industry wants that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's important to remember, too, that these that these signals, quote,  unquote, are coming from users who have installed the Bing toolbar and essentially agreed to  having their clickstream collected and sent back to Bing for feedback.  It's not like Bing is wholesale indexing Google's index by running bots, just running results  and pulling back.  I mean, these are users who are opting in and saying, hey, I'm going to send you my  information.  And so Bing is presumably collecting their clickstream from every site that they're on.  I like what Google Analytics does for every website you look at.  Every modern website is going to have a JavaScript embed in it that's that's that's tracking  your movements around that site and that feeds that information back to Google Analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys think we were going to talk about Eric Schmidt and his his appearance in Davos  a little bit later in the show?  But I think this really relates to the idea that Google is feeling seriously threatened  by Microsoft in a way that we all kind of knew but forgot.  Is this an offensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a point, Becky.  But I'm not sure that that isn't really rhetoric on their on their part.  When asked about Facebook, Schmidt said, you know, again and again, that Microsoft is more  of a competitor and lists the ways that struck me as slightly disingenuous when I heard it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know that, oh, you know, there is no Facebook.  Facebook isn't the problem.  It's actually that wimpy little kid, Microsoft.  Let's focus our attention on how we're walloping them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a way to deflect, I think, a bit and say that Facebook, we do different things.  It's OK.  Are we you know, if you want to find a competitor for us, it's Microsoft.  And then it looks like how we're doing against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Interestingly enough, this Bing search event was a place where Microsoft, sorry, Google,  what's this guy's name?  Matt Cutts, sorry, I'm having a brain fart.  He was making a big play to say that Google is doing a better job at avoiding displaying  results from copied content.  This was a big push that they were making there that, you know, a lot of the search  results and this pertains in some senses to what you guys were talking about last week  with the sort of low quality results that were coming back on Google searches and that  one of the problems is so many of the results are copied material and it's not from the  original source.  And so Cutts was saying that they have changed the algorithm and they think it'll affect  about 2% of all search results.  But that fundamentally, you're going to see the sites that wrote the original content  rather than the scraped or the copied site in the original.  Is this significant, Gina?  Do users really notice this?  Do they care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, publishers certainly care and I think users care.  I mean, and Joel can speak to this as well.  It sucks when you when you write a site and they're just all these blogs that just kind  of pull your RSS feed, republish.  It doesn't look as nice.  The links maybe are stripped.  The images aren't lined up correctly.  It is a worse experience when you go to a blog that's generally that I've seen.  So, yeah, I think this is a big deal to users.  So hopefully, you know, I think that this is a big thing for the search algorithm, for  improving the search algorithm based on time of publish and original source.  But, you know, but it's tough.  I mean, human journalists often don't get the original source correct.  So I'll be I'll be thrilled if Google can get the Google bot to recognize the original  source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Joel, is this a big deal for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's sort of a big deal.  But at Gawker, where I currently work, you know, we we pretty much all of our content  is under creative comments at this point anyway, because we realized after a certain  point, it wasn't really worth our time to try to track down, you know, a hundred or  a thousand different sites that were copying our content.  And in fact, kind of my thought has has come around to I didn't think this way forever,  that if somebody is going to a site that's stealing my content over and over again,  almost everybody is going to realize after a point, you know, through me referencing  myself or the site or anything like that, where the original content is coming from.  And I just kind of see it as free advertising in a lot of ways.  So it's good that Google is going to provide my original link to be the top result.  But I'm not I don't think it's fundamentally that big a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. The big deal today was the honeycomb announcement at Google HQ.  Andy Rubin introduced Hugo Barra, whose big head honcho in mobile.  And I'll just try and outline some of these things.  And you guys can sort of all do play by play and you do the color commentary.  So the first announcement was sort of layout and UI improvements in honeycomb so that  it's tablet optimized and that there's going to be different functionality as people  try and manipulate and multitask.  Jeff, do you think this is this is significant as it tries to compete with the iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what I think was Gina said earlier today that this starts to optimize to  the iPod size.  You know, one of the most impressive things not to jump ahead was that they showed  Fruit Ninja in its native Android application showing on a tablet and it looked great.  And it wasn't just double pixeled.  It was the nails look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but OK, so I just want to stop on that one because I called Google after after we  all talked because I didn't understand that.  How could it be not how could the pixels not be doubled?  Because if it's written in the original Froyo for phones, how is it not just pixel  doubling? And they said what they say it is.  They said it looked great.  Yeah, I mean, that's what's interesting.  It looked good. So something's going on there.  But they said if it's written in Froyo and it's optimized for originally for for  phones, it's not optimized for tablets.  It'll run because it's backwards compatible.  But the developer has to go back with the new SDK and then optimize for screen size.  But I think your point is well taken.  It looked really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's where we go here. I think that the point is that you can run a lot of stuff that  was written for Android phone on Android tablet and you can optimize for the screen  size, but it still works well.  Yeah. On the other hand, there are things that can take advantage of the size of the  screen. And so Android has that.  So widgets, which are kind of a gimmick on a phone that I don't think are necessarily  that useful when you have more screen size so that you can at a glance see three or  four things that are live and occurring, then that's good.  So you can show a snippet of your email and a snippet of your Twitter and a snippet of  something else. And you've got a constant view of it because you have the space to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. Yeah. And it looked like you could customize that to whatever you wanted for your  particular needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That and also the developers can offer you that and they can stay front and center more,  which I think is important.  That and they're very proud of doing the 3D video wall, which is one of those moments,  I think Tom said earlier today, you look at it and you say, wow, but then you don't  really care again. It helps sell tablets more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And talk a little bit about that, because when I was listening, because I was driving  in the initial part of the feed when you and Tom and Gina were talking about this.  So I was listening to you guys talk about it.  So for people who are just listening, the 3D video wall, this is optimized YouTube  video. Is that basically what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just simply that it's it's I think about a three by six and it's round.  And as you as you spin across the videos, refresh very quickly in their images, which  also just shows off the fast processor.  That's pretty much all it is. It's a gimmick.  But again, they're trying to make use of a larger screen in some smart ways.  But they said when I was in Davos that that this OS is also compatible with seven inch  screens like my nice Galaxy Tab.  By the way, I asked them whether Galaxy Tab would be updated.  They said that's up to the manufacturer and they will strongly suggest manufacturers  should do that. So Samsung updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a complaint for the with the IOS.  People would say that you can't force that.  And, you know, right.  But I think what Sony Ericsson, which stink at being, you know, good at upgrades,  that's something that becomes an issue for the user.  Are they going to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'll last point and move on to people who really know what they're talking about.  I think what you have is because of a vast difference of sizes in Android.  What this shows is more flexibility to be able to adapt different sizes.  So, yes, as you know, you were there.  You know, they have the the Android ski goggles and you have seven inch tablets and  10 inch tablets and God knows what else in sizes and without the control that Apple  has over those devices and how they operate, Android has to provide more  flexibility to developers without having to rewrite things 100 times for 100 sizes.  And so what I saw and I love to hear especially Gina on this one because she's a  developer and I'm not and I'll play one on TV, whether this offers some confidence  that if you're going to write for Android, you're not going to be driven nuts having  to adapt 100 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good that's a good point, right, because that's that's one one of  the whole fragmentation argument is the thing that kind of scares some developers off.  Like things act really differently.  And having just released my first Android app a couple of weeks ago, it's really  interesting to see all the kind of bugs that come in.  It's like, oh, when I flip out my keyboard and change orientation, this happened.  It's like, oh, I don't have a flip out keyboard on my device.  You know, I have a list of 10 or 11 emulators that I have to check this app in and see  what it looks like. So, so, yeah, I think that that right that right wants to run on  the tablet tablet phone is a big deal for developers.  You know, the Honeycomb event today was interesting to me.  I really feel like they were playing up Android, the Android tablets strengths or like  Android strengths in general as compared to the leading tablet on the market now,  which is the iPad. So you saw them talking up widgets, right, which the iPad doesn't  have. And I disagree with Jeff. I actually I use widgets on my I hate widgets on my  computer desktop, but I love them on my phone.  The notifications, which Android's notifications have always been far superior to  iOS as far as I'm concerned and over the air installations, this whole like I have  lived a life without wires. We use the Internet to update you.  And so that was the market, the market launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So set this up. What was life like before this over the air upgrades and downloads  basically where you buy online? So how was it before, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, before you had to you had to visit the Android market on your handset and  purchase apps there. Right.  So it was Android strength was always that it was over the air.  You never had to sync your you don't have to sync your Android phone to your computer to  to transfer to transfer apps or music like you can do.  You can do those things wirelessly.  But the Android market launched today is this web based version that lets you say  install this to my device in a regular web browser on any device.  And then it just shows up on your phone instantaneously, which kind of takes us to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the next level. And I think that's it, you know, as it from a user perspective, when  you know what app you want, just go into the marketplace on your phone and grabbing  it is genius. But when you're browsing for apps, it's so much better to do it on a  computer where you have more screen real estate, you have more responsive sort of,  you know, obviously you're going to be somewhere in a Wi-Fi network and you have  better input output as you're trying to search and find things.  So I see the benefit there.  And this does seem really seamless and an upgrade over what the iTunes app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  has. You're right, Becky.  But I think I absolutely agree with that.  But I want to see even more value added now in that they show you best selling,  most popular. But I really want to see featured.  I want to see the three of you recommending things to me.  And that's app brain in part.  But I also want to see Google recommend things and users recommendations and more  ways to curate the apps, because there is frankly more crap in the Android  marketplace. I'm glad for the freedom.  It's worth the price. But that also gives a price to Google to find better ways to  curate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And just on that note, Google today announced that they're going to be  hiring dozens more Android app development people, which is sort of sort  of underwhelming. Dozens sounds so funny when you talk about Google.  But, you know, the idea being that one, they want to create an app lab where  they're creating their own free apps, possibly with advertising for  distribution. But also they've really made in the last few weeks a big push  talking about increasing the quality of the apps that are in the store, having  actual humans go through and weed out the ones that are in violation of the terms  of service for the marketplace.  And, you know, I think that there's they're feeling the pressure of the  marketplace being more competitive.  And I think that speaks to your point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's there's there's a real the question in the air,  unfortunately, for the Android tablets, which is different from the iOS from  iPhone versus Android phones, is it looks to me like and if you went to CES,  this year you saw what like a hundred different Android tablets.  Android tablets have gone from, you know, basically the Galaxy Tab and a couple  other little ones to this commodity product all in a year.  And so, you know, Honeycomb is definitely good to have.  But I I I think there's still a big challenge for Google to even get any of  those units into people's hands because.  In the US, at least whenever you've gone to buy a phone, unless you were on AT&T,  you could only buy, you know, the only the best smartphone option was Android.  Now, if you're going to go buy a tablet, no matter where you're going to buy a  tablet, there's also an iPad.  So they and it's the difference between an iPad and then maybe four or five  different Android tablets.  And I still really question whether or not at this stage of the game, people are  going to be no matter how good Honeycomb is, if you are going to look at four or  five different tablets for running Android and one iPad, if they're going to  see those all those Android tablets being devalued mentally because there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so many opposite.  Joel, I think choice is good.  Is it?  Yeah, sure, sure it is.  And I think because it's not just don't come in different sizes, they'll have  different models.  And, you know, the thing that I'm waiting for is that I think the whole notion of  tablets is itself so limiting that Android should be powering my car and the  back of my airplane seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's fine.  But but but you know that and I don't I don't have any doubt it.  Android is going to continue to be a success.  But I am specifically talking about tablets.  And I think I think if you look at other markets that have been like this, if you  look at the auto industry, which to me is like the biggest example that the consumer  electronics industry should be paying attention to because it was, you know, a  couple of decades ahead, but just collapsed a couple of years ago.  You know, can you say honestly that like when you go, you say, I want to buy an  American car, was it better to go to GM and have GM and Buick and Chevy and Cadillac  and all these different nameplates that basically made the same car but with just  a little tweaks?  Or is it better where they're at now where they sell one car at this level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Joel, you're talking about a point.  GM became what became for a time the largest car company in the world because of  that strategy.  I didn't like the iPod size.  I like my seven inch size because of the thumb typing.  And I had this choice on Android that Steve Jobs ridiculed.  Well, sorry, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like.  Right.  But but but this same week, you know, there was news that came out that the one to  two million Galaxy Tab numbers that Samsung has been talking about sales were just  shipped sales, not actual sales.  In fact, I reached out to Samsung and tried to get an exact unit number.  But, you know, they didn't get back to me on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just 16 percent is the number that's been bandied about on the return rates, which  is obscenely high when you look at the Verizon iPad return rates, which were two  percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's obscenely high relative to an unknown number of actual sales, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a lot harder to return an iPad than it is.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's any harder to return an iPad.  You go to the Apple Store and say you want it.  OK, point is, I will.  You must personally defend Android and I will personally defend iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But like I just I'm not doing that so much as I'm disagreeing with with with.  I'm not buying the punch line, so I'm not buying the joke.  Yeah, no, that's fine.  But versus one product versus many products is bad.  If that were the case, the Soviet Union would still be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, in the chat room, they make an interesting point on this, too.  Steven 7 ohm meter, he says, I'm still looking forward to the days when we can  build our own tablet devices the way we used to or currently build our desktop  machines. I don't like being stuck with a device designed by someone else.  And I think that there's a schism in the consumer marketplace around this is do you  want Steve Jobs, Waldgarden, one design?  You know, what is this this Zen principle of Ma omission?  And it's going to be this way. And this is the way you need to do it.  Or do you want fractured environment, many choices, or do you want the ultimate in  design flexibility to do it yourself?  And is that where we're going? I mean, that would be crazy, but certainly Android is  poised to handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I you know, it's possible it doesn't actually cost all that much money to hire a  Chinese manufacturing firm to lay out some chips and build things for you.  It takes a lot of money to do that and then also have it be a very quality product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to cite the Kmart Koby experiment for the hundred and seventy  nine dollar tablet that came out this Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Or look at, you know, TechCrunch and all of the drama they had trying to  create their tablet. Like it's and not to insult the guy that's in the comments.  I don't remember his name or in the chat room.  But, you know, that that kind of core geek DIY consumer who is, you know, the kind  of person that reads a lot of the stuff I write and that I constantly am insulting  when I say that the core geeks person, the people that used to drive the consumer  and the computer industry are not the core market anymore.  They are a niche market.  And so choice and all of that freedom and all of those things, I really do believe  are market questions.  And even, you know, Jeff and I obviously disagree on on the degree to which more  choice can eventually be a negative thing.  But they actually have that when it comes down to being able to build your own  things and being able to customize things heavily and all of that, that is increasingly  going out of the hands of the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you on that, Joel. Yes.  But I but I still think that the Internet is all about choice in my business and the  media business. Fewer choices.  The controlling people, the people who own media said this is good because we  control it. All the best is professional.  It's wonderful. And you would and they would argue that more choice led to a  decline in quality.  In fact, I think it led to an increase in quality.  I think that Nick Denton has proven that by pushing big media companies to operate  differently because there is more choice now and more competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, that's flattering that you think that Gawker Media produces  content that's as good as the big, you know, as big media companies do.  And I think in certain ways we do.  But at the same time, you know, show me the show me the movie on YouTube that is the  same. And I use the word quality loosely, quality as avatar.  Right. Like the Internet and all of this stuff has diverged.  So you have a lot more people at the low end creating good stuff and have more  power to create good stuff.  And then you have the high end still existing in the middle has gone away.  And all I'm saying relative to the tablet is and I think we probably should leave it  here because I think we're we're we're locking horns is like I just I think that if  consumers who basically only know tablets from the iPad at this point, you know, the  iPads, almost the Kleenex of the tablet world, if consumers walk into a Best Buy and  there's an iPad and then there's 15 different, you know, Samsung tablet tablets or  15 different Android tablets of different sizes, I think that will be a negative to  each of those individual tablet vendors and each of those brands.  So I still think that Android may eventually do as well in tablets as it's starting to  do in phones. But I do think because people aren't forced to buy a tablet like they're  forced to buy a phone at this point, it does change the proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could kiss you both for having a civil smackdown on my first hosting of this week.  Thank you. I know so gentlemanly.  Right. It was it was.  And Jeff was enjoying it.  Yes, it was. Thank you so much.  I wanted to just finish with one more thing about the about the Honeycomb event.  The SDK is going to be live for developers by the end of the quarter.  And the last thing that was kind of a big deal was in app purchasing.  And, Gina, you know, as a developer, this is a big deal for you.  Disney's digital guy, Bart De Creme, he came up and said that, you know, 25 million songs  have been downloaded inside of what's it called?  Tap, tap, you know, but about about that.  That's that revenge.  I was going to say revolution, but there's nothing revolutionary about it.  It's so old, but that's amazing.  And that's all in iOS devices.  And so to have that kind of flexibility within the Android marketplace, this is a big deal  for developers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's another way to make revenue on your app, to expand your app, you know,  to sell it once and then and then be able to expand it with new content.  It's a great thing. It's a great thing for developers.  Developers want to make want to make money.  They want to generate revenue.  So there's another way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are going to take a quick break right now and thank our sponsor, Carbonite.  You know, this backing up the files on your PC or your Mac.  That's what Carbonite's all about.  I am going to use many of my references from my own life.  Number one, I am a bum about backing up and I have videos, hundreds and thousands,  probably of my kids that I should be backing up.  I have all of the documents that run my life.  I should be backing them up.  Well, that's what Carbonite's for.  And now drawing on another reference, do you guys know that one of my other beats  in life is reviewing infomercial products?  Oh, yes. This is this is it's glorious for me.  But set it and forget it is one of the the sort of cornerstones of the infomercial pitch.  And that is the carbonite pitch.  Once you set it, it happens automatically in the background.  And they will back up all the files, as I said, Mac or PC.  And the price is right.  Fifty five dollars a year, 15 cents a day.  And if you've ever lost files on a hard drive and had to think about getting them restored,  it costs so much more than that.  So much more. So we have an offer for you.  It's try it for free.  You can get let me see.  I think it's two free months on carbonite.  And what you'll do is you'll go to carbonite.com, enter the offer code twig.  You'll get two months free with that offer code if you decide to buy the service after the trial.  So go check it out again.  It's carbonite dot com.  And the offer code is twig.  And we thank them immensely for their sponsorship here on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I think I can I break it up.  What one more thing from what I saw Hugo Barra show at Davos.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Showing off the stuff to the press there.  And maybe this is all if it has stopped me.  But but it was a wonderful moment of tying together translation and voice so that  you could have two people who were talking and finally demonstrate this.  I've been talking about wanting to this where I can say a sentence in English.  It will then type it out in German.  You hit the button and it speaks it in German.  The other person says this sentence in German.  It types it out, hit the button and speaks it in English.  Wow. And Eric Schmidt said, you know, this is going to stop World War three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was your what was your sense of the quality of the translation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very good. Very good.  And it's the same translation we see.  I mean, there's nothing nothing terribly new here.  So they just put the pieces together.  They have the voice recognition.  They have the speech, the text to speech, and they have the translation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and they have the desire to stop World War three.  That they do. Yes, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this might be what else did you see at Davos that you thought was  that was compelling on that line?  Because I think this is also an interesting segue into the speak to tweet  service that Google was getting involved in to help  Egyptians when they were cut off from the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you go straight there because I think that's a fascinating project.  I can tell you, I talked to Google folks about that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why don't you set it up for us, Jeff? Tell us a little bit about it.  This happened.  You know, the Internet has been restored  somewhat in Egypt as of now, but for five days, six days it was out.  And to give voice to people who were denied Twitter, Google and Twitter  and another company set up a phone number, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd say now say now was actually start was acquired by Google last week,  by chance, and it was set up to allow Ashton Kutcher to have  to give up the horrible task of typing  and that he could come in and just leave a tweet by voice.  And people say, oh, Ashton speaking to me.  And then they can listen to him.  So they came along over the weekend.  People from the three companies, as you say, or two, in the sense  that I was now owned by Google, sat down and came up with a means  for people to record tweets in Egypt.  They don't have a local Egyptian number.  I'll tell you about something else in a minute that does.  And then it just goes up and it's an audio tweet.  But then there was crowdsourcing of transcription and I believe  translation as well.  So some from Google told me that they're doing one to two a minute  as of yesterday, which consider  considering they have to call to Bahrain or Italy or the US is fairly surprising.  And and that you can now the New York Times is listening to this.  You get to hear the voice.  It really becomes a fascinating thing.  What what I love about what I hate about this story  is that we have found the single point of failure of the Internet.  It's government kill switch.  It's been saying this for a long time.  And there was two at least two kill switches.  One is the ability of government to tell companies to just turn it off  and block services.  And the second is DNS.  You know, if Libya falls, they better be nervous.  And so Libya is already, by the way, already cut off services.  So so the single government, a single point of failure of Internet  is a very frightening thing for our future culture all across.  I was talking to the CTO of the World Economic Forum about,  you know, should we fear if you're in Russia today,  you fear this is going to happen there.  What do you do now? And he said, well,  China and Russia, if they cut off the Internet,  would cut off a huge part of their economy, Egypt, not so much so.  But I'm fascinated by how people are.  The Internet was built to go around blockages with no Internet.  Culture is now built to go around blockages.  So the fact that this Twitter device was created, Huffington Post  created local numbers with Skype in Egypt so people could call it and leave messages.  I suggested they should also put up news reports because news Al Jazeera  was cut off and news was cut off.  So they did the same thing.  An Egyptian could call a local number and get a news report.  The fact that people have been faxing out, they've been  they've been relaying, you know, through things like ham radio.  Dial up modems.  I love God. Who the hell is my acoustic coupler?  And I eat it with the revolution.  So all these things, you know, you find hope in culture  that we will we will now root around blockages even to the Internet itself.  But the fact that the Internet was cut off, the bigger issue here, I think,  is that this shows the true definition of net neutrality.  This shows the true need to believe that the right  to connect is a fundamental human right.  And when it is cut, it is a violation of human rights.  And so Google tried very hard not to be political about this.  And they're not.  They said specifically, we're not saying anything about Mark.  We're not saying anything else.  But they use the technology to allow people to continue to connect and speak.  And that's a wonderful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think even the late night comedians got into this.  They didn't quite have the passion that you do about it being a fundamental right.  But Conan O'Brien said that if you want people to sit around and do nothing,  turn the Internet back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For God's sake, I put up a question.  I came back from from dinner one night, right?  When all this Egypt stuff was starting to happen  and they were starting to shut down the connections.  And I put up a post on Gizmodo that basically said the same thing.  As you just said, Jeff, I asked the readership, is Internet access a human right?  And, you know, I think it was pretty obvious from the subtext  that I agree pretty much with with with you from the way I wrote it.  But I was shocked at the responses that I got from people.  I'd say at least half of the people, but maybe a majority of people,  said Internet is not a human right.  You know, and it kind of got  mired in some capitalist arguments, which I didn't exactly.  Not what I was trying to make.  But but yeah, it was very frustrating to me.  And I was surprised how many people said, essentially,  that they didn't view Internet access as as being fundamental.  And I think that there's I actually agree with you 100 percent on  on the way you feel about it.  But I also think there's a rough road a hoe to convince the rest of the world  that we need to have some guarantees in place because you're fighting.  Not just be asking this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the discussion.  What I'm seeing is and see if it was the same for your discussion,  is that people jump to the next step and say, aha, by saying  it's a fundamental human right, then government's going to provide  the Internet access and not saying that what I'm saying is that  that, you know, just like I've got free speech means I have to maybe  buy the newspaper or buy the book, but I have a right to do so.  And no one's going to destroy those things.  Right. There was definitely a socialism versus capitalism argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that people were trying to put in there, which is not at all what  what gets concerned.  Yes. You know, because if it's socialism, the government can cut it off.  If it's capitalism, businesses can cut it off.  My point is, is that nobody should be able to cut it off.  I can't, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, you agree.  I think they're agreeing.  They're agreeing.  It does seem like a fundamental  tenet of democracy is just that's became so clear to me in all of this,  is that, you know, the Internet is just it's synonymous these days  if you don't have a free flow of information.  And, you know, going back to the speak to tweet thing, which so Mubarak  does his taped speech saying he's not going to run for reelection.  We're dependent upon old media for the images because there's no sort of unfiltered,  disintermediated flow of information coming out of Egypt.  So that's when I turn to speak to tweet to try and get a sense of, OK,  what's the reaction like?  What's it really like and not be dependent upon ABC and NBC and CNN.  And that was where it was really helpful.  And I thought, God, you know, this this is just such a crucible  and such a way to see how this is all playing together in a very short amount of time  in a very just it's totally explicit that what you guys are saying  in the tenet of democracy is fundamentally tied to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's also that what they showed in Davos, that if I could put up a tweet  and I could now tweet it across 20 languages,  which they haven't done yet, right?  They haven't even done speech recognition yet.  But all this becomes very close.  You know, the whole translate thing has changed me and surprised me.  I, you know, speak one point one languages.  I speak German really, really badly.  And I'm now spoiled by Google Translate because rather than, you know,  give myself a headache and try to go through, I'll just hit the button  and I'll be close enough.  But I also see that if somebody writes about something I say  or something I'm interested in in Norwegian or Polish or Russian,  I'm no longer scared of that.  It's no longer apart from me.  I can now in an instant get a sense of it.  And that's that's, I think, more profoundly changing than than we yet know.  Global Village Time Group Hug Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you were pointing out kudos to Google.  And do you think that this is a good way for Google to sort of kind of  rush off some of the icky China feel and go for something  that's a straight democratic play in some place where they could make an impact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. I was I was actually saying kudos to Google for doing  so we're launching this on Twitter and not saying, well, we're going to do it on  buzz. Yeah, you're right, Gina.  That kind of thing.  But yeah, I was this is the kind of thing that makes me feel feel good about Google  and keeps me the Google fangirl that I am.  I think I think it was it was definitely it also speaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It speaks a little bit to the reasons why Google has been trying to push so hard  while at times push hard on the white spaces initiative  to try to set up a wireless infrastructure that doesn't rely on other companies  or other other companies, even within the US.  But unfortunately, all of this stuff ends up routing back through backbones.  And until we get some sort of, you know, crazy, handheld, powerful mesh  network sort of thing, it's always going to be possible for the next,  you know, foreseeable future for people to shut down the Internet.  And that's that's that's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moving sort of in a strange segue.  Google is saying that they're also lashing out against the dominance  of one company that's that's sort of big brother in Apple.  And this is I'm moving into their teaser for their Super Bowl ad.  Can you play a little bit of that, Jamerby?  Do you have any of that?  See if you can pull it up. I'll see if I can get you a link.  But basically, it's it's in the Google spreadsheet.  If you can grab the Google Docs, I read it says goodbye 1984.  Have any of you guys seen this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please. You have, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have not. I'm loading loading it up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I actually saw just right before. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's just sort of interesting in that it it sort of plays on.  This is not 1984, the dominance and the one person controlling all things.  And I don't think this is their Super Bowl ad, but it's I mean,  it's a it's a teaser to it.  And I found it really interesting that they chose this venue  to really go after Apple.  Gina, what did you get after you after you watched it?  Sorry, Jeff, what did you get after you watched it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think you said it well.  I think it's I think it's just  trying, you know, we've noticed this irony before that  that Apple was the anti IBM  1984 model that now Apple is the model.  And you wonder if that becomes a natural life cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's it's sort of good guy, bad guy.  All of that. You got it. Cued up, Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Jeff and Joel's conversation right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Choice versus. Yes, you're right.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Except at the end of the day, I feel like they're both big companies.  So you can't really ultimately trust either one to completely be on your side.  You see, that's where your prejudice is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  July, no, it's coming to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean all companies, you know, it's just like this 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a space scene here for those of you who are listening, not watching.  It's counting backwards to 1984.  And there's a planet with two very Apple  S earbuds, earbuds sticking into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One authority, one design, one way to work.  It's time for more choices.  Bum bum bum, more speed, dual core, one gigahertz processor,  1080p HD video playback, 3G upgradeable to 4G, more speed, more flexibility.  Honeycomb, Adobe Flash, front and rear facing cameras.  More freedom. Big Red Ball.  You get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big Red Ball, we all want to move to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's from Motorola, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's that's that's such crap.  I'm sorry.  There is choice.  Like if people there, it's not like there wasn't a choice  whenever the iPod came to dominance, like people just bought more iPods  for a variety of reasons, because it was good, because it was trendy,  because they had good marketing, because iTunes worked well.  Like, you know, there's all these things.  But there was never not a choice to use another MP3 player.  They were always on the market.  So I it just torques me so badly whenever  Google or any of their partners or anybody tries to espouse  this whole choice thing as far as you don't have to use Apple.  You can use, you know, Google.  You've always been able to use them.  And that's not, you know, if they want to talk about choice,  they should talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same about Google, right?  The Google people say Google's a monopoly.  It's not. And Eric Schmidt says that there is a perfectly good alternative  for everything Google does, except perhaps find advertising everywhere.  But but but its freedom, I think, is an appropriate description,  competitive description for Android versus iOS. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is this commercial is about the launch of the Google tablet.  OK, I mean, the tab, the Galaxy tab is not their official tablet.  I mean, I think I don't I don't think I mean, you really didn't have  I'm that much of a choice.  There really isn't a viable tablet.  This is kind of the first Google tablet, right?  Coming out with honeycomb.  So I think since 1984, I mean, like the I know that that's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, why would you go back to 1984 to say, like, well, you know,  there hasn't been a choice in portable tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a young man since I was around and you were in diapers at best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't in diapers when I was well, I was in diapers when I was six years old.  But there's no way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we had we had, you know, CPM was gone.  Remember that you don't.  And like we had was PC's, right.  And so Jean is right.  You know, when I when I was a Davos, I was getting  money going my machine and they did say to me,  it's just a really large phone, Jeff.  Now, so we didn't have a choice and we know we do have more choice.  I'm amazed by this tool that you have this this this anti choice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the word fanboy has been said in the in the chat room.  I mean, I'm not I'm not calling you out, Joel, because you and me are both newbies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So worse than fanboy.  I can take fanboy.  But the thing is, I do want to underscore, like, I think I think honeycomb looks awesome.  I'm actually considering moving a lot of my mobile stuff away from iOS to Android.  I mean, I keep Android phones around to, you know, to use and be familiar with  and stuff like that, but I'm considering moving my personal stuff over to it.  You know, I think it looks great.  When I say I have questions about the success of Android in X category,  I'm not saying that I think Android is inferior at this point.  I think anybody would be silly to make that argument.  I'm saying that I think that all of that choice can be just as much of a detriment  as a benefit. That's really my only point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, new numbers came out yesterday from Nielsen just to sort of underscore  the points being made here.  And I think it's really interesting because this is the classic three way tie  is going on right now between the phone operating system.  So, Apple 28% of market share, Android 27%, RIM 27%, but here's the interesting one.  43% of all smartphone users were activated, new smartphone users were  activating Android phones.  And Google says now they're activating 300,000 new devices a day,  up from 200,000 in August.  So, I mean, the trends are clear that, you know, choice of carrier, choice of device,  choice of input output mechanism, whether you have a virtual or a physical keyboard,  those are things that are certainly and price, I mean, price points.  So many of these Google phones, the Galaxy S series were free or sent over the,  you know, over the fall and winter purchasing time periods.  And the other trend that came out in this is smartphones in general,  huge jumps for non-whites.  Asian Pacific Islanders, 45%, Hispanics, 45%, African Americans, 33%, whites was 26% on a smartphone.  And I think that is hugely important as we see the, you know, the growth of this category  and the decision about whether it's going to be Apple or whether it's going to be Android.  Do you guys agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's said that the next three billion people who come online in the world will come online  through phones.  And I think what the device shows and Murdoch even said this today at the Daily,  which we'll talk about later, that what we're really seeing is the death of the laptop.  We've heard that before, but even Rupert could, you know, get that line.  And so the connectivity that we're going to have, the connectivity is going to matter in places  like Egypt is going to come from smartphones and that there's a skip that's occurring here.  There's a lot of people in the world that are leapfrog over PCs.  And these are just US numbers, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's what's crazy.  I mean, it's definitely the trend starts here as much as it continues in other countries.  But I just found that fascinating.  I think you're totally right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know, my friend, well, colleague, Matt Buchanan at Gizmodo, he and I were talking about trying to work on a piece  a couple of weeks ago about basically, you know, what are minorities using for their smartphones?  Because when the sidekick was really starting to take off in on T-Mobile, you in New York, at least.  And I mean, this is all anecdotal for me, but I just saw tons of black people using sidekicks  way more than I saw white kids using sidekicks.  And I thought it was really interesting.  It's like, OK, there's this huge trend within a certain demographic of using a certain phone  that I feel like the predominantly white tech press or whatever doesn't pay attention to.  And so, yeah, it's interesting to try to follow those trends across and say, OK, you know,  what are the different demographics and ethnic groups and races and things like that use within the US?  But then can you or how do you extrapolate?  Well, you can't really extrapolate it with that from the US to the rest of the world.  But how do you try to design a product for that for the rest of the world?  And I definitely think, you know, Android's got really good, is in really good shape to be localized a lot more  specifically to different cultures and different groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it would be really fascinating to see if you could break down the data and see how many of those people,  those quote unquote minorities, also what their their access to home computers are.  And I bet that it would be considerably less than whites who don't have smartphones, but use their laptops a lot more.  So I think that's you know, it's definitely a trend in a certain direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would go ahead. Sorry, I just I've always I've always had this pipe dream that I would love to know  all of the ways that everybody accesses the Internet at all times, because I think I have a really good sense of it  because of what I do and because I pay attention to it.  But I I run into stuff all the time where I realize like I met a girl a few months ago who just lives out.  Yeah, don't worry. It's available.  Like and and she lived off her iPhone.  I never known anybody who basically didn't use a computer and only used a smartphone.  Yeah. And I realized then, you know, and not just on the smartphone a lot, but that was her computer.  And just seeing that like individually in a real person completely blew my mind.  And I know that there's lots of use cases out there like that, that a lot of us that are steeped in tech don't don't necessarily see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to jump us ahead and just kind of slam through some of the other interesting things that are happening in Google this week.  One of the most visual is Google announced that they have a new art project that brings street street view technology to some of the best art museums in the world.  You can as if you were walking down a street in street view, you would be walking down the halls of the Uffizi of the Tate of them all kinds of in the moment.  It was amazing. The list of museums that they have.  And as you walk down the halls, you can click into certain paintings that you want more information on.  And then they have incredibly high res photos.  And you can really get down to the detail of just seeing, you know, what all the the like the edges and the ridges of the oil in the oil paintings are.  I thought this was such an amazing use of the technology in ways that really will be fantastic for students and anybody who's planning a trip.  This is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's awesome. It's such a good use of the technology.  I mean, the fact that you can see the cracks and the strokes and the starry night like last night, I was zoomed really far into starry night.  It was amazing. It's like you get to put your nose right up against the painting, you know, that's at a museum or on the other side of the world.  Really cool project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you were like trying to figure out if I could go to one museum, which one would it be?  You'd get to sort of do a virtual tour before you had to make the decision.  Yep.  Another cool story.  Physicist Stephen Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha guy.  I can never say it right. Wolfram Alpha guy.  He says that Google would beat Bing if they played Jeopardy together.  Oh, yeah.  So in his test, Google got 69 percent of the Jeopardy answers correct.  Ask.com got 68 percent and Bing got 63 percent.  Now, in context, he says the average human contestant gets 60 percent of answers correct.  Ken Jennings, the Jeopardy Zen master, has a 79 percent success rate.  Wikipedia.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twenty three.  You cribbed the notes.  Terrible. I did. I totally cribbed the notes.  Bing's really got to work on their signal gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. If they were direct copying, it wouldn't be, you know, maybe this is in defense of Bing.  I don't know. We'll have to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My friend Steve Baker, ex-business week, is writing the book about  Ken Jennings and the other Jeopardy star against IBM's Watson.  And he's releasing it very interesting way where you can buy the book now.  You get the first 11 chapters and then he'll also he's writing the 12th now,  which is after the contest. Then you get the whole book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool. A couple other stories we need to dig into here.  Let's see. Google Docs getting a priority inbox. Finding and sharing documents easier.  Gina, you think this is a boon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little better. I'm still sort of confused by Google Docs.  Just kind of like list of documents. So you have, you know, my co-worker was saying,  like, I have my sister's resume next to like my proposal for work. It's strange.  But this new update is pretty cool. It makes labels and folders.  You can organize your documents and collections, I think they're calling them.  And a doc can appear in a couple different collections. So there's sort of like folders  that also have the benefits of labels. And they've also got this priority sort.  So in the top right hand corner, you can sort by priority.  And I think the priority is just kind of determined by the activity on a particular doc.  So today my twig rundown kind of floated to the top of my Google Docs list because you all were  editing it. So yeah, it's an improvement. I still want to see more of this kind of thing.  I still feel like Google Docs is just this pile of stuff from every different context of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then in sort of this productivity vein, Gina, continue on in terms of talking about the  interoperability for Windows customers, HTML5, Windows Media Player extension for Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is kind of interesting. So a couple of weeks ago, we talked about how Google Chrome  officially dropped support for playing H.264 video when it specified an HTML5 video tag.  Well, Microsoft has sort of jumped up and said, oh, we'll fill that gap. And they're offering  an extension for Chrome on Windows 7, which will play that video. So I found this fascinating that  Microsoft is making a Chrome extension, which does a thing that Google sort of officially dropped  and created this whole sort of kerfuffle in the community about dropping support for a video codec  that they would have played by default. So no worries. You will be able to play. I mean,  we knew that someone was going to come up with an extension or an add-on. It's just, interestingly,  it's Microsoft. I believe this HTML5 extension for Chrome is for Windows only though. So I'm sure  someone will come out with it for Mac as well, if not Microsoft. Didn't that announcement make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  feel like it was 2011 to you? Like it was just such a strange announcement that Microsoft was  writing a plugin for a competitor's browser that allowed basically Apple's championed video format  to run. I thought the whole thing was really surreal. Yeah, it is kind of weird and surreal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it's also, hey, it's also Microsoft saying, here's a way for us to get Windows Media Player  onto your Windows PC or to update it or get some sort of component onto your machine,  because this is something that you're going to want. I have a fundamental question for you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, which is the kind I usually have for you. In the discussion two weeks ago about H264 and  Chrome, how open is Chrome and how open is Chromium, would you say? How open like in terms of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like as an open source project? Yes, yes. Yes, so well, there's Chromium, which is the open  source project, and then there's Chrome, which is Google's sort of distributed user product.  I actually haven't looked at, I'm not sure what Chromium's release schedule for the actual code  is. I don't know if it's like Android where they kind of work on it, not in secret, but internally,  and then they do this big release kind of later on, or if it's consistently open. I believe that  Chromium is, the Chromium open source project is sort of consistently open, although I hope somebody  in the chat room will correct me. Why do you ask? Well, probably for the book I'm working on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is trying to see the areas in which Google is open and closed and open and closed, and it's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a mix. Same with Apple, if you're not sure. Right, right. Yeah, it's Google. They're just like,  it's open source when we release it two months after consumers get it. Yeah. Is that Chromium,  the browser, Chrome the OS? Well, there's Chromium, the open source project, and then  there's Chrome, the distributed browser, and then there's Chrome OS, which is kind of based on-  Right. Is Chrome OS open at all? Well, it's based on the Chromium project,  so it's powered by the Chromium project, so yeah, it's all. Thank you. Very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. Jeff, a few months back, you suggested a Gadget of the Month club on buzzmachine.com,  and now you say Best Buy is acquiescing to your needs? It's an interesting variation on this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where, we'll put this up on the show rundown, Barry Judge, who's the chief marketing officer  at Best Buy, blogged this today that I had asked for was that, you know, I want to buy  my, I've pulled up three times already, my Galaxy Tab, but I also know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it when you pull it up, because I can see outside of your window at how  outrageously icy and cold it looks. I see it in the snow, yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll turn the camera around in a second. And so I'm stuck with it for two years, right,  and I wanted to have some kind of system where I could join the Gadget of the Month club,  and I would pay a premium for getting something right away, or I might pay less,  forget something later, and I blogged about it and said to Best Buy, are you listening?  Not suggesting that I had any role in this, but they just announced a buyback procedure,  and it's a very clever way for them to make money. Let's be very clear about this,  but you buy, and here's an example, an iPhone, and you pay 60 bucks, which gives you the privilege  then to have it bought back, depending upon how long you have it. So six months later,  they'll pay you 50% for it. There's a rather rapid depreciation, but if you say one year later,  they will pay 40%. But you know up front, so you can take that as a known front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know up front exactly what the price is, the exact percentage, exact price, so that I could now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say, and I bought my Galaxy Tab on T-Mobile, which Best Buy doesn't sell, and I know that I'm going  to get frustrated with this. So if I bought it on Verizon and Best Buy, I could, 60 bucks is a lot  of money to buy into this thing, but it's a lot better than their FACACTA warranties I never used.  I could give myself the guarantee of upgrading to the next thing. And I asked them today, well,  what does this do with things like early penalties and all that? And they said that if you upgrade  within the same company's plan, it'll just pass right over. So if I'd gotten the Galaxy Tab and  said on Verizon, or I think they have it in Sprint, their Best Buy, and I paid this fee,  they would buy it back to me, back from me in six months for 50%, or one year for 40%. It goes up  to two years at 20%. And then I could buy the next thing. I could buy the Honeycomb Tab and be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically, if you're an enthusiast who's on a different schedule than the upgrade schedule,  this is a way to sort of amortize the cost or mitigate it to some extent, at least so you know  it in advance. I mean, we have Gazelle as one of our sponsors, and you would send your phone back  to them, but it's a different model because you would then find out at the time that you send it  back to them how much you would get. This is guaranteed. It's kind of consumer-based obsolescence.  Right. Right. Oh, sunlight. Red, red, hold on. Oh, no. Oh, there you are. Hello. Oh, no. White,  I'm white. I'm half white. I'm a strawberry sundae. It's all right. We need some diversity on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  show. It's fine. Bring whatever color you have. I've got to give it to you. I'm the guy to give  it to you. Yeah, that's you. So Barry Judge from Best Buy also said that maybe what comes next is  leasing. And the weird thing about this is it's kind of obnoxious American forced early obsolescence,  right? Rather than using this thing through its full life. Well, you know, I'm sorry, I buy another  one, another one, another one. Look at Leo's closet. Obviously, I presume, I never asked them,  Best Buy has an aftermarket for this stuff, and they're going to make profit on this, and I'm going  to be able to get the latest greatest things. And it's a small market for this, but I really kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like the idea. Yeah, I think it's very cool. And you know, just giving consumers a choice. I have  to do the math to really figure out where the break even is. But yeah, that seems like that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the weak spot is just not a great deal. No, you're right. It's not a great deal. And it's also you  got to really make a lot of judgments about what the value of your product on the open market is  going to be in a year before you even buy, you know, buy the 60 bucks into the plan. 60 bucks  might be your entire profit margin for reselling something. So which is exactly the problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  leasing, right? If I buy a car with a low turn back value. So you're right. You know, there are  arbitrage in our risk, whether you do our spot our beloved sponsor or try to sell yourself on eBay,  or do this buyback plan or do a lease. What it says is there's an option for me not to be stuck  with the device. And as technology rapidly improves, I think it's good for the industry too,  because you know, what's tele what's one television manufacturers doing now they're  desperate to convince us that 3d is the next must have thing. And they working. But there are  better TVs, there is this there is that that you might want to upgrade. And it's nice to have that  option. But you're absolutely right, Joel. The risk now moves to us. Webby in the chat room says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy resales on eBay, just like gazelle does. So there you have it. Gina, what's your tip of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  day? Tip of the day? Well, real quick, Jeff asked if chromium was truly open source. It is I'm  browsing the source control repository. There's a commit 14 minutes ago. So it is completely public  open source. And there's also a chromium project and a chromium OS project and that Chrome and  Chrome has come out of just want to clarify that. Thank you. My tip of the week is another Gmail  tip. Last week, we talked about the unread message icon on on your browser tab. That's kind of a  subtle way to keep track of how many emails you're not listening, you're not reading. But this this  week, there's another Gmail setting in settings. They've got this little notification icon that  comes up. It's kind of like the toaster on on Windows. Or if you run growl on Mac, it's just a  little a little flash that comes up when you when you receive a new message on the spot. So if you  go into your Gmail settings, it's it's a mail notification. So you can say you can set your mail  notifications on you can say just notify me if mail and my priority inbox shows up. And you can  also do the same for chat. So little flash notifications if you want to drive yourself crazy,  watching email getting interrupted watching email come in every time.  Respond immediately. Respond immediately. Respond immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't necessarily endorse this. Jeff, what's your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The number of the week is $30 billion. That's how much Robert Murdoch said today that the  News Corp put into developing the daily which is their new so far iPad only app.  At Buzz Machine, my humble blog, I went through the economics of this because there are only  two facts that he gave us on the economics. One is that is that they cost 30 minutes to develop,  but they've already written that off, which is to say that, you know, he doesn't care if he makes  that back. Wow. And the second is that it will cost roughly a half million dollars a week  to operate. They add those two together and you have a $55 million cost for the first year.  And that's the peanuts, folks. Portfolio magazine may rest in peace went through  and what I thought was $40 million. Others say $100 million. The project Alicia,  which was supposed to be a News Corp aggregator went through $30 million before it was killed.  So this is a hefty investment. And I talk a lot on the show about paywalls and such and Murdoch  is charging 99 cents a week or $40, $39.99 a year for this. And so in the blog post,  I'm asking people to help me try to figure out the numbers of this because it gets a little  complicated. It's not as simple as saying that he needs 500,000 subscribers pay, you know, paying  $1 a week and that equals $500,000 profitable. It's almost that simple. But there's churn people  leaving there's a marketing cost to getting this. There's Apple's 30% share. And he said in public  I'm surprised at this. You think that Apple would be so into hugging him right now,  they would have negotiated and they didn't for the first year. So Apple's still taking a 30% share of  the subscription rates and I assume of the advertising as well. And you look at the numbers  that he has to hit, I'm figuring he has to net at about 750,000 subs. These are really, really  figure into VR numbers. Be very clear about that, which means he probably has to sell about a  million with churn. And I guess my numbers are way out of date. The last number I saw for iPad  sales was 7.6 million others said that it's more than that. But it's so it's a, you know, a 10%  market share and compare that to wired which sells 22 issues a month, 22,000 issues rather.  But that's down 20% a month over two months. I'm sorry, glamour is down 20% a month over two months  to 2775. So Murdoch has to sell in round numbers 35 times as many as wired sells  to reach this level of profitability. My number is six months, six months. And then, well, before  it goes away quietly with tail between leg. You know, I would be accused of wishing for the same  thing people came in and said, Oh, you're being anti Murdoch again. People actually read my post  and said, No, I'm not. I'm just reasonably asking questions that I hope journalists will ask and  answer and people who can do spreadsheets, unlike me. Possibly, I mean, you know, listen, if I'm not  against charging for content, I'll sell you my book happily. And then if Murdoch succeeds,  that's another realm. And that's the exact thing very much. available on Kindle and audio. And so  if he succeeds, you know, fine, good. I'm not against that at all. I'm just dubious whether it  can but but I want to understand the economics of this. I want to know what's going to go on. I want  to watch it very carefully. You know, the other issue is, is content an application? Is the  application good enough? I don't have an iPad. So I can't see it yet. I unfortunately couldn't go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last night. I mean, I downloaded it looks fantastic. It's you know, visual I like the UI.  You know, Tom has complained that the update schedule is not robust enough for him that it's  just once or twice a day. That's ridiculous. But you know, and I have friends who are working  there right now that have gone from old media and are really excited to learn there. And if you know,  if I had the if I was in their position and had the opportunity to go do that, it would be like,  hey, if you've got the money, I've got the time like, hey, that's like digital J school for me,  I'll go. And I think a lot of people who are working there feel that way. And I don't know,  I just the metrics on this are unbelievable. And I think you're questioning the number is,  is the right tack because sure, it's beautiful. Sure, it looks great. That's not the business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I know Gina, you don't have an iPad to do this on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was like, what's this? Oh, something I can't look at. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then again, where's the Android? No, you have an iPad because that's all you want in the world  is the one thing and you're done. Oh, don't start it up. How do you like it, Joel? Have you seen the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  daily? I actually sold my iPad. I don't have it at the moment. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm absolutely  serious. I don't have an iPad. I wish I had an iPad because they're for reading mostly. That's  what I miss it for. But no, I haven't looked at it. I think the daily is going to be, you know,  your Android tablets are going to help the daily a lot, like because they're a lot of the Android  tablets are not going to have as many options for that, that sort of reoccurring, you know, big money  media push for their devices. But Rupert has already said he's planning on pushing stuff out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to Android relatively soon. So maybe that's why they're not getting the discount from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he says something odd. He was asked about that. And he said that the iPad was last year's,  this year's and next year's technology. And I don't know if he meant that just culturally or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  contractually. Interesting. I couldn't tell. Interesting. Well, I'm going to wrap it up this  week with Leo's tool of the week. And I think I really need to side with Joel and be the  iOS person, the voice of iOS to maybe be the even out the panel here. Oh, don't be that person.  Oh, I shall. I shall. But I'm bringing it all together in a sense of unity and world peace,  because the Google shopping app has just been released for iOS. And I downloaded it. And it's  great. I mean, as a consumer reporter, I love this kind of stuff. It has an image search so I could  just do a quick scan of the cover of Jeff's book and it would give me all the prices online  and locally and then has a voice search. Check this out. Okay, speak now. Pampers. Oh, shoot,  I always do that voice search. Pampers size five. And look at that. It's pulling up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a six year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have two three year olds. Luckily, they're not in that size anymore. But yeah, it did a great job.  Pulled it up. Pampers size five. Like really? So you can do it with voice. You can do it with images  and if you're a shopaholic or professional shopper as I am, Google shopper. That is my tool of the  week. Hey, I really want to thank you guys for bearing with me in Leo's absence and had a great  time. Thank you. Thank you all. And you know what I'd like to do as we close is give us your Twitter  handle because I think it's you know, we've mentioned the sites that you have but Gina  Trapani, where can we find you on the Twitter? I am at Gina Trapani on the Twitter. Very difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to guess. Yes, very creative username. I like it. Jeff Jarvis. Jeff Jarvis. Nice. And Joel Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No imagination. Joel's gonna beat us now. Yeah, mine's I sold my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last word. No, Joel Johnson. That's all it is. Nice. And I am B. Worley. W-O-R-L-E-Y on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you all. And thanks to Carbonite for sponsoring the show. Take care all. See you next  week on This Week in Google.
