It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show we cover at Google, but anything else we also want to talk about.  We talk a lot about journalism. That's partly because we have one of the most prestigious professors of journalism in the entire world sitting on my right hand.  It's the lovely and talented Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying not to bore you with journalism today and try to stand up to substituting on Gina Tripani's screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, you are on Gina's screen. So you're on my left hand. I apologize. I was looking over here. But wait a minute, it's Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land.  A great person to fill in for Gina Tripani. Danny, great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. It's good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina has the day off as you probably figured out. I put some journalism stories in here, Jeff, because I wanted to ask you about them.  Oh, OK. See, I think of you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sense the audience running away at this very moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes. You know, it's funny. I was talking to Abby about it and she said, that's kind of inside baseball, Dad.  But it was an article in Medium from a BBC tech journalist who says tech journalists are facing extinction.  Very soon I won't be needed. David Lee writing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Danny's, Danny's, Danny's yawning at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It's like this on top of yet another SEO is dead article.  I was I almost tweeted yesterday that telegraph marketing is soon will be dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No more dot dot dot dash dash dash ads in your inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. And OK, in that case, yeah, because, you know, now I don't think tech journalism is going to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He actually makes the point that I would make, which is that, you know, he's he's talking about basically how in the in the in the 90s, the BBC had an Internet correspondence correspondent.  And the notion that, wow, there's an Internet correspondent. Everybody blew everybody's mind.  Of course, nowadays, if you don't cover, you know, if you're covering the news, you're covering technology.  And I think that that's probably really more the story, which is technology journalists to survive need to be techno experts writing about everything else.  And I think that's a fair way to to put it. You're a journalist is always a journalist, and that's not going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, so that's sort of like saying everybody uses money, so we don't need a money correspondent.  You know, and the reality is I agree with the idea that you don't necessarily have to have a reporter which just covers the Internet because it's a weird new thing.  On the other hand, it's extremely helpful to have a reporter who covers the technology beat because they want to do in depth coverage of what's going on in the technology beat in a way that you don't cover or don't understand if you're just a general assignment reporter.  And I, you know, I deal with this all the time.  And we saw this with the whole right to be forgotten stuff where you'd have people who didn't know search engines who would understand what they thought was going on with search engines and make assumptions that weren't necessarily correct because they weren't.  Search journalists and they weren't even tech journalists.  They were like, I'm a political journalist, but I understand some of the technology stuff.  So I guess I know what I'm right about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually the real risk, isn't it?  That technology be written about by people who use it so they think they understand how it works.  And the net neutrality debate is another example of the deep technology you need to have to understand what's really going on is because beyond me sometimes and certainly beyond any general assignment reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But and I think I think you get both of those, by the way.  I think that sometimes it's great to have someone who doesn't understand technology because they don't sometimes get so caught up and trying to explain all the nuances and they just approach it as a as a normal.  And you get a better perspective in that way.  But I think you'll still have tech journalists as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At some point, it's another way to express it is when everyone is a tech journalist, no one is a tech journalist.  And and part of the problem with tech blogs, as don't we know, is that is that the explosion of bad Xerox is getting weaker and fainter with each copy is really ruining the field to some extent.  And there's only so many good ones.  You are one, Danny.  I think we code is good.  I think the verge is good.  But there aren't many now.  There's a lot of crappy copies out there.  And that affects the field.  But that doesn't mean that it takes away from the need for people who do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, article in New York magazine about Kara Swisher.  Did you see this?  So look, I'm sure I can't figure out it looks fake.  She's very it looks like it's one of those.  It looks staged Silicon Valley's most feared and well-liked journalist.  I'm not sure about the well-liked, but feared for sure.  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like you said that.  I just hit in the trees is a strangest picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it's a it's like staged.  She's supposedly talking to Jane Metcalf, founder of Wired, who has apparently from 10 B movies, extras from 10 B.  Yeah, I didn't know Jane Metcalf wore a scarf kind of like I don't know, Steve Tyler and Aerosmith.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  You went fairly behind behind to the right.  Looks like, you know, an extra out of costume from Ben.  It just begs to be Photoshopped.  And then you got with the guy with the gimme hat.  Yeah, you know, who looks like he's out of some baseball movie.  Yeah, it's a very weird picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is.  You know, it's funny because I think probably people, you know, kind of gloss over and start reading the article.  But you and I both went, what what's going on in this picture?  Strangest thing.  And they do point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I couldn't come up with a way to tweet about it to say what was so weird about it.  But it's very well, it's also the way it's lit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very odd.  Anyway, we shouldn't focus on the picture because it's really about Kara.  We just did.  Good for her for getting.  But I laughed a lot because at one point it says one of the reasons for Swisher's unusual status in the valley is her longevity.  Now, fifty one, she began covering tech in the early 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That long ago.  Anyway, she certainly is one of the most powerful people and she's one of the best.  She's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's give it the recode really has high standards and and for them a scoop is really a scoop.  And they link to things and she's very good.  You know, here's the thing to me.  Moss before Recode when they were at the journal Mossberg was the brand he owned it.  Now to me, Swisher is the brand.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Walt's not been writing a whole lot of recode.  He's kind of the elder statesman at this point.  Yeah.  Speaking of pictures, did you scroll down to see the picture of Kara that that's weird, too.  That's great.  She's in the Ivy lost in the Ivy.  There's her dogs, one of whom crapped on our cottage floor when the caravans of this a few years ago.  I'm not sure if it was Phineas or Leroy.  But anyway, isn't that weird?  It looks like that looks like the ad where they they pulled the old Chicago player at the Ivy at Wrigley Field.  I can't remember who the ad was for, but it kind of reminds me of that.  Kara is a character.  We love Kara.  Anyway, enough inside baseball.  Let's talk about Google.  Big story.  Alan Mullally, who's just recently departed as CEO at Ford and a really, I think, well regarded CEO, perhaps one of the best CEOs in the country, has now taken a job with Google.  He's on the board of directors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And wasn't he rumored to be a CEO candidate for Microsoft?  Or was that always just speculation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was speculation.  Nobody really said.  In fact, one of the things we heard is that the Ford board went to Mullally and said, would you please deny this because we can't get back to business until you do.  So I don't know if he really was considered.  He certainly was mentioned.  I know Mullally because we've interviewed him many times for this show.  Ford was a sponsor and we always got good access to him.  And I always regarded him as a very smart.  He was an engineer at Boeing, designed the triple seven cockpit, went to Ford.  And really turned the company around to the point where they didn't have to take any money from Congress as the other two big three automakers did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And don't have the disasters that GM has just across the board now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No GM disasters, exactly.  Ford's become a very successful, probably the most successful US auto manufacturer, maybe the most successful in the world.  And he's a smart, cagey guy.  But I knew he was retiring three years ago.  He told me, yeah, you know, he's in my 60s.  You know what happens when you hit 60?  It's all downhill.  It's all downhill.  He said I'm in my 60s.  I want to spend more time with my family.  This is much more like I expected.  Yeah, that's a second chapter for him.  And the board of directors effective July 9th.  So he's sitting there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting too, because I think I think Google's biggest problem now, which Schmidt has long said, is that the company is too big.  It's hard to manage.  I hear that from around there that it's siloed and it's got issues.  And you take Mullally from a huge company like Ford.  And I hope there is some insight to figure out how to keep Google to be Google.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you've served on boards.  Yes, tiny ones.  Tiny, tiny, tiny.  What is how important?  Well, see what I guess it depends on the company.  For instance, Microsoft's board is really a rubber stamp.  They don't.  There's only a few people with any power on the Microsoft board.  The rest are just there to say, yes, sir.  What is I don't know what the maybe you maybe you have some insight.  What is the Google board like?  Is it is it smart, strong minded individuals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I know.  I don't think so.  Let's look who's on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Larry is and Sergey, of course, and Eric Schmidt, John Doar.  There's a strong minded guy.  That's true.  General Parker partner Kleiner Perkins, Diane Green.  She's from Intuit or as a member of the board of to it.  MIT chief CEO of VMware from 98 to 2008.  Smart technologist John Hennessy, president of Stanford.  He's not going to be that tough.  No, and Mather.  I don't know what and Mather.  She was previously director of Central European Media Enterprises.  Oh, geez.  OK, money.  Graham.  She was at MoneyGram International.  She was Pixar exec, EVP and CFO at Pixar.  OK.  But only from 99 to 2004.  She was also a village road show.  You know, one of the things it tells you is what is the most powerful  and one of the things it tells you is which areas Google has some ambitions in.  Autos.  Paul Adelini, former CEO at Intel.  There's a strong minded guy.  Paul Adelini is not going to take a back seat to anybody.  Ram Sriram, who is a venture capitalist.  He was also at Amazon in the early days.  And Shirley Tilghman, president of Princeton.  Two big academics, Stanford and Princeton Press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there was a few strong personalities on there.  I think this is not a board that's going to fight Laurie and Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem when you have founders on the board and former CEOs on the board.  It really is tough to, you know, to stand up if you're, you know, the president of Princeton say,  well, you know, I think Google should do this.  Yeah, well, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think I have such liberties.  I would love to be on more boards.  I found it absolutely fascinating.  And in one of them, I was the outside director and I was well, I've always been the outside director,  but I was I was needed in that capacity.  There were there were issues in the board where I was the guy who had to stand back and say,  whoa, everybody and say some of the tough things.  That's what a board should be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should be a board should not be a rubber stamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but you know, you just you merely it's a small group of people.  You get the dynamics a lot easier than you do in a company and in a in a time Warner with task forces all over.  It's a lot harder. You have, you know, six, eight people and you have a tough issue before you.  And you can see where the interests are.  Yeah, that makes it pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think it's interesting that they've got somebody from the movie industry on the board.  Alan has experience in autos, of course.  So with the autonomy at autonomous cars, that will be interesting.  But he's also an aerospace engineer and certainly has some aerospace ambitions with Project Loon and drones and so forth.  Anyway, I think it's a good snag.  I'm sure he'll be on other boards. It's not a full time job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to be on that board. That'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. How does that work?  Does it is the board probably the board has a committee on board members that nominate people on the board as a whole vote?  Yeah, probably.  Well, what they also do is they hire headhunters just for boards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I mean, the issue is you have higher liability in the public company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But incidentally, Happy birthday, Jeff.  Oh, he turned 60 yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My entire comment on it was I saw that period.  F word period. I saw that. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how I started my day yesterday with that little choice post on Google+.  I loved it. Google+.  Danny, what is going on with Google+.  You know, Google was kind of at pains.  They didn't mention it at Google I.O.  But Larry, in an interview, was at pains to say we're very happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  He was very excited about it.  If you were more excited about Google+, you'd be I guess I don't want Larry to be that excited about anything if I wanted to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was violet blue who blamed Sergey Brin in no uncertain words for letting her down.  Now, the good news is one of the things violet blue was so mad about was the Nim Wars early on.  Google plus demanded you use your real name and people like violet blue and others who well either didn't want to use their I guess her real name is violet blue.  So that's not an issue. But there were others.  Our own Dr. Kiki, Kristen Sanford, who is who is best known by her brand, Dr. Kiki, had trouble being Dr. Kiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At some point, didn't she? Yeah, she succeeded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lady Gaga succeeded. You know, if your big name you succeeded.  The example violet blue brought up that was the negative was that somebody who was in gender transition kind of got outed to her and employers because she had two Google Plus accounts  and official one in her own. And then because the names had to match, it got revealed to her employers that she was in transition.  She wasn't ready for that to have happened. And that's one of many good reasons why anonymity might be nice.  Google has announced they announced yesterday we're going to let go of that requirement.  We're going to allow you to use handles on Google Plus. But is that much of a real change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it has. I don't think that's a change suddenly to cause people to embrace Google Plus if they weren't doing it already.  I suspect that it's a change that's being done in part to hide other disconnects from what Google Plus was to what it's becoming.  And in other words, you know, back when when Vic left and then the rumors came out that Google Plus was going to die, there was all this discussion of, well, no, it's not going to die.  And, you know, we love it and it's going to stay there. And I think really the the better perspective was, no, they're not going to kill the Google Plus sharing system.  But all the Google Plus application that had been going on within Google where they would take Google Plus and use that to underpin everything is going to slowly over time be backed away.  And the products are not going to be required to have all this Google Plus stuff in them, although they'll still use Google accounts.  And then if you think about it from that way, then you can imagine that if, say, you're on YouTube and you are used to having a handle or name or whatever, you don't want to start up your YouTube account and then be forced to have to have first name, last name and all this weird stuff.  And in fact, when they merged the two together, they didn't force that upon YouTube.  And if Google goes out and brings in other products or if they're changing other products that are out there, they may have decided, you know what, enough with this.  OK, we wanted everybody to have a verified identity on Google Plus and they all had to have certain names.  We're not we're not trying to shove Google Plus at anybody anymore.  So let's back off on the name requirement, because not only does that help with the relatively small people who are upset about it, I mean, it wasn't impacting that many people.  And I'm not saying it's not a big issue for those people.  But if you wanted to list all the reasons why Google Plus is not more popular, this wasn't a big issue for it.  But there may be other. Yeah, well, anyway, but there may be other issues that are going on.  But I suspect that this is tied to something we haven't seen yet.  And to give you an example of that, and then I'll shut up.  But a week ago or two weeks ago, Google announced that they were no longer going to show images or authors in their search results.  So you have to be Google's on this big thing like you should you should use Google Plus and tell us your name so that and then link it to your website so that if you've written a post,  we will have a picture of you that will show along with your name and you're an author and everything.  And they dropped all that. And everybody's like, why did you drop all that?  Because you you told us that this was really big and it was really helpful and it did a lot of good stuff for people.  And I suspect one of the reasons they dropped is because they knew that they were going to let up on the name requirement.  And maybe they'll start to let up on the image requirement that's free with authorship or whatever.  And so if someone wants to go by a name of, you know, Big Daddy, check me out.  And that's their name. They want to have it.  That might not be the author name Google wants to reflect in the search results that anybody might see as well.  And so there's all these things going on that I don't think we're getting the full picture of.  And I suspect that this name change isn't just about dealing with some of the real issues that people have had, but it's connected to others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll all get tied together. Yeah, I'm looking. I just searched for my name, Leo Laporte.  And I did the author equals in the rel link or whatever it was you were supposed to do.  And it used to be when you'd find my blog, there'd be a picture of me on the left. That's gone.  That's kind of annoying. I mean, I spent a lot of time getting that working and I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The conspiracy theory on that was that it reduced click through to Google ads. I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw. And that was based off of one really, really tiny little study.  And I know the person who did it. We looked at it and we thought, should we write an article like we'd like to see a little bit more off of this before we decide that was the reason it was more paranoia speaking than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reaction I saw to the name change thing was, oh, the trolls are going to come back to YouTube.  I saw that in a lot of British sites. Well, that I mean, look, so that's the trade off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Real name policy means really in general, you're going to be responsible for what you post.  Whereas when you on the other hand, there's a real value to anonymity on the net.  We don't require real names in our chat room, for instance, that has a mixed bag.  Some people can do stuff and drive bys and stuff. They're not really responsible.  And it gives them a freedom to speak. Certainly, if you're a whistleblower or there's you know, you're in a country where it's not OK to speak your mind.  These are all valuable things. Doesn't Google still? This is my question.  And it's free, I guess, for you, Danny, doesn't Google still know your real name?  Isn't it isn't it, in fact, just giving them more information, tying your handle to your real name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it depends on how you sign up for stuff with Google. Right.  I mean, if you if you open a Gmail account, I don't think they're requiring you to like they thought they verify your name so you can put anything that's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a Gmail account. It's chief to it. Yeah, I could change my name to chief to it on my Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could change it. You could change it now. Good luck having two or three accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me tell you about that still. But you don't want to have multiple accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. You never want to Google apps account.  But, you know, they, you know, they can figure out your real name if they want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, it's to me, it's OK. You want to be conspiracy theory minded.  It seems to me the real advantage to Google is good. We're going to we're not we know their real names are gathering information on that.  Now we'll know their names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The real I think the real name is you kind of go to something else that seemed to be part of what Google was trying to do, which is that.  And this goes to Eric Schmidt's book that he had that he brought out last year, which is that, you know, Google had this belief or seemed to have this belief that the more they could verify everybody's identities, the more they could then decide this is good information.  This is bad information. You know, we can trust this person. We cannot trust that person.  And so, you know, this seemed to be a blow against all that. Right.  If you're if you're not going to be verifying people and having them use their names, then this whole thing that you were spinning up about how we're going to have verified information and so on, it doesn't work as well.  I don't get other benefits that come out, which may be information you weren't going to get because people didn't want to share it under their own names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I have a slightly different take on this and it's and it's in Kuwait.  So I'm not saying it's complete, but but I think that and we had this just got a little bit of discussion a few weeks ago when Zuckerberg said he was breaking up the big blue app and he doesn't care if you use WhatsApp for chatting and use Instagram for photos and use Facebook for this and so on and so forth.  Google's essential structure is that they have an underlying relationship database on top of all kinds of apps, maps, mail, calendar and so on that generates signals about your context of what you're doing right now and help Google give you better service as a result.  Right. So what should that underlying database look like? The problem is that Google Plus kind of violated that.  It said everything social is right here in the same thing. And if you want to do photos, it's here. If you want to do talking, it's here.  And if you want to do hangouts, it's here and you got to come to Google Plus to do that.  And I think that's anti Google. I think it's better to have these things be somewhat separate and under underneath that is a separate functional function of identity.  And so I think identity needs to be a lot more sophisticated than it is now where you will have your real name here.  Wasn't a good enough policy. Obviously, when you use wallet, Google knows something real about your identity.  When you use Android, Google knows something real about your identity.  Maybe not your name, but they have something that is tangible to tie into.  And so there's a quality of identity that I think is much more subtle and enters into things as we move forward.  And it's not as simple as saying, number one, you must use your real name in Google Plus.  And number two, all these functions fit with that identity in Google Plus. That's what was getting them in trouble somewhat.  So I think separating them out as concepts will let them develop in ways that I can't predict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know they're sitting there at Google and they know exactly what they're up to in there. Listen, I'm laughing.  Yes. You mortals, you mere mortals.  He fooled them again.  I think that just reading the tea leaves.  I just think Jeff, that underscores what I was saying.  I think Google does have a coherent database and giving them your name is just one more signal.  It's very easy for them to correlate that with your real name.  It's all in the service of gathering as much information as it can about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the solution to the damned multiple account problem, which has never been solved.  It's never been solved. They promised and promised and promised.  They said, oh, we have the same problem. We're going to solve it.  They haven't. The solution is for me to have the facility to say that.  And that is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what author equal it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the same with that's me. They should want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that I think this kind of goes to what you're saying, Leo, where, you know, they will.  And and some of what you're saying, Jeff, where, you know, they're trying to force this all into one place.  If you flip back and look at Facebook, you have a Facebook profile and you can decide to put stuff out on your Facebook profile as you want.  But that's primarily something that's only used at Facebook.  Right. You know, your bio that would have these links.  This is this is. But but no, no.  Your your profile. Right. You also have a Facebook account and your account can be used to do all sorts of things like I'm going to have an Instagram account.  And if I use my Facebook account to open Instagram, I'll set up a profile as I want at Instagram separately from my profile over Facebook.  And what Google had was Google accounts and the Google account started gaining Google profiles.  And then we got Google Plus. And then they made the whole thing like there are no more Google accounts.  You really kind of have a Google Plus account, although, you know, there are some people who have Google Plus accounts that don't enable Google Plus.  So those are Google. You know, they really kind of got rid of the idea of Google account.  I think that's what's coming back is that we're going to have Google accounts and Google accounts may have profile information, you know, that that primarily you might see within Google Plus.  But you'll use your Google account for other stuff like I want to enable maps and on maps.  I may have a different profile. I might even have a different nickname that I want to use when I'm on maps than when I'm commenting on YouTube in different places as part of this whole spirit of, hey, the days of one giant app for everything is over.  Now it's all about, you know, everybody's got the single purpose app that's sort of coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fair. Also, I should point out it's very possible that Google is completely benign and just observed this wasn't serving people, wasn't it wasn't a good thing.  OK, you know, violent. It's very possible. Google said, you know, violent made a good point. Let's get rid of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or could be that Vic was this was I mean, I get religious about things or this could be fixing religious about it.  And now he's gone. Well, does anybody really care about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's there's an engineer in the thread who is a really, really long thread who actually commented and said this was in the works before Vic left and Vic was aware of this.  It wasn't something that happened at this just suddenly happened at the same time.  You know, as a reaction to violence concerns, you know, over two years, three years after it happened, it's like I maybe I'm just too cynical.  But part of me thinks, yeah, Google's about to launch its own secret app.  And so they decided, well, we better have an anonymous name situation because I think that's what's going on.  Oh, yeah, you know, maybe. Wow.  But that's like that's a good theory. Right.  But I mean, if you're if you're Google and you're looking at the explosion of things like this and then the media is this sort of stuff, we can't do it because we said everybody had to have real names.  Then then suddenly saying, well, you know, we've thought about it.  And you're right. It only took us three years to decide that it made sense.  But now, you know, we're glad we arrived at the right decision in the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Snapchat came out in secret and whisper came out.  Facebook's tried twice now to create such apps.  Google hasn't done anything that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they can't. I think I think it's a problem for Google credibility to come up with things that are like that.  I think Danny's theory is right about about an account architecture and identity architecture being separate things.  I think that's that's the kind of Google way to look at things.  And if anybody knows your knows their way of thinking, it's you, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things they said is that up to now, Google flagged pseudonyms or name or even unusual names like Violet Blue for review.  That's gone. Pending appeals have all been granted.  If you appealed and said, I know I want to use that name, they said, OK, and now you'll be able to change your name.  It used to be you could change it three times in two years, which is not a lot.  Now it's once every 30 to 90 days, once every three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another thing, by the way, is, you know, if you really are kind of scaling down Google Plus and you're losing people and you don't really want to spend a lot of time on it, having somebody sit there and deal with all this stuff is easier just to say, yeah, whatever you want.  Whatever do you want? You're good.  We're going to we're going to or cut you in a moment anyway.  So you find people who were assigned to try to enforce these rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all right. I like real names on one.  I mean, I really have mixed feelings about this.  I mean, I think real names do raise the quality and the tone of the conversation to the degree that people are or have been able to use phony names on Google Plus is the degree there's been trolling and harassment on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what was happening is, you know, whenever I put a got to the point on Google Plus, put up a photo, I would get the horrible comment spam.  Cool. OK.  Right. And how were the all those things appear?  They appeared in names like the appear to be Thai or Vietnamese or something like that.  You won't know where they're real name anyway.  What's where's where's the dictionary of real names across all languages?  It's pretty hard to give anybody the job to say that.  Dwang dong is not a Vietnamese real name or it's a made up spam name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here's the good news. We've had three years of real names.  That's enough. The tone has been set.  Yeah, that's true.  You could also just say fine, now we'll stop.  But really, the tone has been said. I'm not going to what am I going to do? Change my name? No.  Yeah.  So it's a job done.  It would be another way of mission accomplished.  Another way of describing this.  Google, one of the creators of Google Glass has gone over to Amazon.  I thought that was kind of interesting.  Maybe, I don't know, maybe Babak Parvez, who is one of the research directors on Google X.  Maybe he's going to Amazon to do Glass at Amazon or maybe there's other big projects.  Or Glass has such cooties now that nobody cares that he left.  Yeah. He did also do Google Contact Lenses, which is something that's actually starting to come to market.  Novartis.  Novartis has proposed.  Or at least research, yeah.  Yeah, well they have to do FDA approval, obviously. It's not imminent.  But these would be contact lenses with circuitry that would be able to do things like, for instance, measure your blood glucose level.  That's something Google doesn't probably want to get in the business of because you have to get FDA approval.  It's a medical device. It's kind of a different kind of business.  Let Novartis do this. That's what they do so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went and spoke to Novartis once in Basel and the size of the structure of having to test things.  I just, I just, it was, I mean, I knew it intellectually.  But when you sat down and saw how many people they had to get for each test and all they have to go through for the data.  Jesus, it's unbelievable. I mean, for good reason, but.  Yeah, absolutely for good reason. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's that big New York Times article we all saw that by Andrew Ross Sorkin, who somebody said is Wall Street's favorite Times reporter.  That Rupert Murdoch offered $80 billion for Time Warner.  But buried in there is the notion that now that Time Warner turned it down, now that Time Warner has turned it down, it might be in play and that Google might be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the most absurd speculation of the month because Google cannot own content.  It just it just would put itself in terrible channel. But it does. It owns YouTube.  No, no, no, but that's not no, that's not that's a platform for content. It doesn't own the content there.  It doesn't even when it bought next to networks, it kind of shoved the content aside and kept the platform.  And the problems they have in Europe now, the problems they have in Europe now about complaints that they advantage their own stuff.  Well, yeah, they're going to push their own maps. That's OK.  But if they start pushing their movies against somebody else's movies, the antitrust festival is just going to be gigantic.  I can't see them doing it. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I you know, back when the rumor was in the day that, oh, Google could buy The New York Times, I used to be the same thing.  Like, well, no, they would never do that because they don't own content.  And that's a real conflict. They they own all sorts of content now.  And I've I've given up trying to figure out if there are no go areas for Google or not.  Will are there reasons why they wouldn't do it? And are they going to do it?  There's good reasons why they wouldn't do it.  But yeah, I can see Google deciding that they want to buy a network and they could buy something like Time Warner and they could decide that they want to sell off parts of it.  And we want to keep the cable thing.  Oh, you know, we we want to keep this as a continued experiment of what we're going to do in delivering information and really, why would you want anything that's in Time Warner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? Oh, I want to go well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you what would you want? I guess that's a good question.  What is Time Warner? They spun off the cable division.  That's the one that conquers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they spun off the cable, which maybe they want to buy the one time or cable they might have wanted.  But that's delivery. Yeah, they spun off the magazines because they have cooties.  Right. And so it's HBO.  It's the Warner Brothers studios.  You should not own HBO. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think you should own YouTube, frankly.  But that's another matter.  When Sorkin wrote of this in The Times, I guess Variety magazine asked Jeff Buks, the CEO of Time Warner, about this speculation.  And Buks says, I know nothing.  I don't know whether he did it in a Hogan's Heroes accent.  I know nothing.  So we don't know if you know, this is classic rumor crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's also Rupert Murdoch having fun and putting Time Warner in play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He loves doing. You got to think he just loves that.  I mean, if you're like you're ancient, you're rich.  Let's just play with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the interviewer is going, I got interviewed by the BBC a few minutes ago.  It's just it's everybody's going to speculate and have fun with us now.  It's around Sun Valley. You know, it's silly season.  They do stuff for the Allen conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, let's take a break because when we come back, I want to talk about what some are speculating is a massive shift to Gmail.  Too bad, Gina's not here. Maybe you talked about it last week.  I don't know, because this is something really Gina would have something to comment about a Gmail API and how that might change things coming up.  First, though, a word from our sponsor Hover.com.  A better way to register and manage your domain names is how you know, when I discovered Hover, I moved everything over there.  By the way, they have a great concierge service that will help you move your sites.  The Valley, they call it now the Valley Transfer Service.  For free, they will move your sites over the let you know, which, by the way, is not an insignificant chore.  I wish I had used this Valley service because there's other domain name companies that don't want you to move and they'll lock your domain.  They'll make it hard. The Valley service does it for you for free.  They transfer all the DNS settings. They do it all so easily.  And the cost $10 that includes an additional year on your domain.  Right now, Hover is having a sale on all the new domain name extensions through September 1st, whether you're an existing customer or a new customer.  Great time to start a new project. Every single new domain.  Deep discounted. I'm talking dot club dot ninja dot guru dot just about anything.  Geeks, developers, designers, programmers love Hover.  They know it's going to be simple.  They're done with the idea that you try to buy a domain name and you have to go through 80 pages of yes, no questions.  You want to buy this? You want to buy this? All that upselling.  Hover gives you what you need. You register the domain name.  They give you this week in Google Club. This week in Google Community.  This week in Google Camp Academy Institute International Foundation.  You state an education on so you get a education for 16 bucks for a year.  That's good. Look at all of these.  They make it so simple. They give you who is domain privacy because they know that you're going to want that.  You can add email to any of your domain names. That's a real good reason.  You may say, well, I don't need to do a website. I'm not doing a website.  But let me ask you, are you still using at AOL dot com at hotmail dot com?  Even at Gmail dot com is your email address. What if you decide to move next year?  Are you going to have to tell everybody your change the names? Best thing to do.  Do this when your kids are young. I did it for Abby and Henry.  Get their name and as a domain name, then they can say, hey, my email, it's Abby at Abby Laporte dot com.  And no matter what they use from now on, whether they use Gmail or anything else, they just have it forwarded by hover to that system.  That's so good. Very powerful DNS management, bulk management tools, fantastic support team, the best support around.  They're famous for their no wait, no hold, no transfer customer service.  When you call, you'll get a real Leo Laporte dot exchange holiday. Oh, I need that one dot email. See, there you go.  Get your name dot email. See, would you see if Laporte dot email is there?  Because then I can say Leo at Laporte dot email. That would be a good name. That would be good.  Quick, get it quick before somebody else does hover dot com.  That's one of the problems with hover. So easy and quick. People can can jump in.  I'm going to do it. I love hover dot com and you will too.  I want you to go to hover dot com and get 10 percent off your first purchase.  All you have to do is use the offer code twig in the number seven twig seven because it's in the seventh month.  We thank hover so much for their support. I mean, you see, could you let's see that's management.  See, by the way, the management console is so cool. I've got the who is privacy.  I do lock down and I have auto renewal turned on. Look at all that.  I have all twig dot careers. I have twig agency, twig company, twig equipment, twig expert.  I love that. Let me see. Let me just try. See, add a new domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, little port that email has been taken like recently.  I'm not sure. I searched for it right after you asked.  So sorry about that. I can get Laporte dot today.

I got Laporte dot report and free Laporte dot com.  I love it.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, what was I going to say?  Oh, Gmail has announced an API.  This is one where we really wish Gina were here.  Because, you know, the verge or the story, this is more than just like a little announcement.  This is the new Gmail.  Maybe Danny, you can elucidate.  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not even up on it.  Well, the idea would be.  It's easier for third parties to interact with Gmail.  Yeah. Well, let me explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can fill this in a little bit because I've struggled with Gmail's IMAP.  Gmail's IMAP implementation is nonstandard.  It's one of the things that screwed up Apple Mail.  Because, yeah, they do some things that are not supported in Gmail.  For instance, you can use IMAP to get your Google Mail.  But, you know, Google's labels are not IMAP folders or labels.  And you can have multiple labels on a single message, which IMAP does not allow.  That's why they're not folders.  So it's a potential problem.  But I think it's a potential problem.  I think it's a potential problem.  I think it's a potential problem.  I think it's a potential problem.  I think it's a potential problem.  I think it's a potential problem.  And IMAP implementations with Gmail, you won't necessarily get a one-to-one match.  So, but IMAP is an API, if you think about it, as is POP3.  These are agreed upon protocols for contacting a server and interacting with it.  You say, give me the mail.  The last message I got was this.  Give me everything new.  The server reacts.  There's more to it than that.  But that's basically what a protocol does, what an API can do.  But I think Google's is a great example of that.  Google's is a great example of that.  Google's is a great example of that.  Google's is a great example of that.  And that's what I can do.  But I think Google's responding to the complaints about Google's IMAP by saying,  Look, we're going to give you better than IMAP.  We're going to give you a full API.  So if you're an email client, you can do all the things that IMAP does and thens them.  So if you're an email client, you can do all the things that IMAP does and thens them.  They say it doesn't replace IMAP, and I think it'd still use IMAP.  They say it doesn't replace IMAP, and I think it'd still use IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it more than that, Leo, with an API?  Now any application can work with your Gmail account.  Any application.  Exactly.  You can now imagine email as being more integrated with other things.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there are limits.  It really isn't an IMAP replacement because there are a limited number of calls  that you can make each day to the API.  So it's much more what you're describing, Jeff,  where I'm using a program.  You know, maybe I'm using Flipboard and I want to email something.  You know, maybe I'm using Flipboard and I want to email something.  Normally what Flipboard will do is launch an email client  and do it that way.  With an API, if you've got Google credentials in Flipboard,  If you've got Google credentials in Flipboard,  you can just have Flipboard send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you could create a new Huawei calendar application  that can schedule things with people and stuff.  In fact, in the story that I read,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sunrise, which makes a fabulous  Sunrise, which makes a fabulous  web-based but also Android and iOS calendar  that uses Google Calendar said,  Yeah, we could use this.  This would be good.  So, yeah, I think this is...  I'm not sure I would agree with the verge.  This is the next generation of Gmail.  But we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends if somebody invents something amazing with it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still don't have an API,  a right API.  They have a limited API for Google+.  Alice Hamburger writing in the verge  says the Gmail API could turn our email accounts  into gold mines and that's a good thing.  Remember, Google started this.  Before Gmail,  you deleted the mail as you went.  Because you didn't have enough storage for it.  And Google's whole pitch with Gmail was  don't delete, save all your mail,  and now you have great search,  and that mail becomes a database of useful information.  This just takes it to the next level, I guess.  Apple and IBM are partnering  in enterprise. IBM is going to port  many of its enterprises, quite a few enterprise apps,  to the iOS platform.  Some have said,  in fact, we were talking about this on Windows Weekly,  that this is perhaps targeting Microsoft,  compelling mobile API  for enterprise, or mobile platform for enterprise.  But most agree,  it's really aimed at Android, which doesn't.  And it could become  a big differentiator between  iOS and Android  in the enterprise space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, part of what Paul said on Windows Weekly  was, and this would have surprised me,  is that IBM's not that much in the enterprise anymore.  And you guys then went on to make fun of  Lotus for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think  his, obviously, IBM's  entire business is enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but I wonder what he meant by that. That's what I'm saying.  In terms of what's its clout  to deliver enterprises through this?  That's, I think, what he was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, in particular,  compared to Microsoft,  which has a very compelling  enterprise story across all platforms,  Azure Cloud,  desktop with Windows,  and of course, on the Windows phone,  and they all integrate,  I think it goes after Microsoft a little bit as well.  But it  really puts the screws to  Android. Because Android really,  I mean, it's, and I  mentioned this, it might really be against Samsung  because Samsung is starting to move into the enterprise  with their Knox platform and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, which didn't at IO,  Google take on Knox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, no, they  embraced it. Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. They took on as in hugged.  Yes.  Smart move.  What would Android need to do  to be competitive  in enterprises?  And what's the  vulnerability with BlackBerry  dying? Where's the opportunity  here? Where's the need here? Well, the pitch on BlackBerry always

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was that it was a secure server that you  could run in your enterprise. So your  email would be secure, safe,  controlled.  The BlackBerry as a platform itself  was secure so you don't have to worry about  industrial espionage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From everybody except the Saudi Arabian  and American governments. Well, then they gave the source

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  code to India, that kind of. But I think  you can't say that  about, at least the perception of Android is  it's insecure, it's unreliable, it's  a patch and mess  of holes. It doesn't have a  consistent story across the board.  iOS has a much stronger,  I think, story there. What this is in response  to is the fact that business  was owned by BlackBerry and Microsoft  until 2007.  And all of a sudden the iPhone came out and people started  bringing their own device to work.  And IT directors who had first  rejected this were  forced to embrace it.  And that's really changed  the landscape. All of a sudden you're seeing  iPads in business, you see iPhones  everywhere. It's put BlackBerry  almost, put BlackBerry out of business.  I think it's  one of those  partnerships, the IBM Apple  partnership, it's one of those partnerships that  you see every once in a while where two companies  get together because the enemy of my  enemy is my friend or  something like that.  Hidden from Google.com.  It's not quite what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  want it to be. It's a little too manual right now,  but I do hope it can be automated to find you  everything that had the right to be forgotten  that's now memorialized  and Streisand did forever.  It was just a matter of time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  before somebody did this.  A list of search results admitted, erased,  or censored due to the EU's  right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that completely bogus made up  site. It's not real?  No. Oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, if you look at the first comment,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like one of the first comments should be mine  asking the guys some questions on how you  came up with all this. Where do you get this stuff?  I think they get it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  occasional stories or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no mechanism.  There's no mechanism. It's guessed.  So, for example, take the third one.  Mario Constella Gonzalez.  I'm probably not pronouncing it right.  That is the guy who  caused the whole right to be forgotten thing.  He's the one who created this.  To my knowledge, he hasn't actually filed  a right to be forgotten request.  And actually, if you search for his name, you will still  find the whole thing that kicked all this off.  So that's bull.  Yeah. So, some of these  other things, they've taken some of the ones down  that I called out and said that that wasn't correct.  Oh, you did?  You don't necessarily know  that these are correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they have on the right is a link to the source.  And it seems like the sources are news articles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about... Yeah, but the sources are news.  So what's happening is  Google sent notices to publishers  saying, we have taken  an article out of  search results for  names we will not tell you  or name or names  that we will not tell you.  So what people started doing  when these first went out was going  and thinking, right, well, this article is about  this former Merrill Lynch banker.  Therefore, the Merrill Lynch banker  is trying to clean up all the search results.  And in fact,  in that particular case that happened  with the BBC, it wasn't around the banker.  Google came back and finally said,  actually, it was one of the 27 people  who commented on the article who decided  they didn't want that article showing up with their name.  So, you know,  these articles,  you can make it a leap, as some people  are, mistakenly in doing this,  that whatever the article is about,  that person must have made the request.  Or potentially, you could go through  and pick out if there was only one name  mentioned to make that.  But the source is not the source  that these were things that were being told.  And in fact, we don't even know why the source,  like, hidden from Google, hasn't even told you  who submitted the links.  You could go submit a link  and say that Google told you this had to be removed.  And for all I know, whoever this guy is  that created this site  isn't doing anything to verify it.  So it's like a whole site.  I am too. I was hoping.  It's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't they...  They do put on the page

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where there's a link erased.  There is a reference on that page that says something has been...  There's a reference on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, not on the source pages.  No, no, but on the Google search results,  it says you're not seeing  the full results.  And Google will show you that  message for virtually any name  you search for, regardless of whether or not  something was pulled. That's the other confusing thing here.  So Google did two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google did two things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in recent weeks.  One, they started telling publishers  whether or not a link was pulled, but they didn't  tell it what it was pulled for.  Two, they started putting  increasingly, and eventually it will be  for every name  for someone who is not a celebrity,  I'll explain that, a disclaimer  at the bottom of the page that says  some results may have been removed.  Or some results may not have been removed.  Because the problem  is Google wants people in the EU to understand  that this kind of censorship is happening.  But they can't put it on  just the places where it's happening,  because in some cases where somebody has a common  name, then that's effectively outing  the particular person to say, and they made  the request. So their policy  is, we will disclose on every  common name that we can come up  with, and we're rambling it out  even more and more. But basically, if you do  a search for a name and you get one of these notices,  we want a notice to come up for any name  that you search on to tell you that the results may or may not have been  censored. That is not an indication  that any censorship actually  happened. And then the reason you get  the exception for the celebrities  is because  if they started putting  that on just every celebrity name,  then people would assume that  celebrities are going out. It's like the reverse.  People then would see this for celebrity  names and assume the celebrity is trying to keep  something out, so they're not trying to make it show up  for celebrity names so that people won't get the wrong impression  in that regard. So, and these  two things are being connected, so  this site is bull.  It's like bull.  It's like crap. No one should share it. No one should  talk about it. This kind  of site may emerge  with care could be done  to help you understand that. But a lot  more care should be happening than what's going on  with this guy's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the judge that says  Microsoft has to  delete or reveal  email stored on servers  anywhere in the world? The US judge  remember we talked about the  Canadian judge that said Google has to delete  stuff on its servers everywhere in the world.  Well, now there's a US judge  who said that Microsoft doesn't  matter. He says it doesn't matter  where the data is stored. It can be stored

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  overseas. But if there are cases like that where judges  have tried to say, if it's in your  control, that's sufficient.  So all of this is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is part of the  and I've got this article eventually I'll get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  called the myth of Google censorship.  There is this game  that gets played with  countries that want to  censor search results and Google  and to some degree other search engines as well.  You see this in Microsoft. And the game is like this.  Well, we want  to regulate the internet and at the same time  we know there's no possible way we can regulate  the internet. We want to regulate the internet.  There's no possible way we can regulate the internet  when we don't control the whole thing. So  if we want search results censored  we're going to tell you to censor the search results.  Google will say, okay  French court, we have now removed  the results from Google France.  Censorship is done.  And then the court goes, aha  you have removed it from Google France?  Nudge, nudge. Alright, we get it.  We've done the censorship. We're okay because  no one in Google France would ever go to Google  dot com. Aha.  And this is like what happened in China, right?  There's a whole thing I think in Stephen Levy's book  where he talked about how when Google had to  do the censorship in China  they censored the stuff for China.  They didn't censor it for dot com.  And no one really thought to look at the dot com  site. They don't think about it.  So, okay, we have censorship.  And that's where the server data is stored.  It's the same sort of thing. Oh,  you're a company doing business in our country.  You're a company doing business in our country.  Right? You have offices here.  You sell advertising here.  You reach out to our consumers.  You are a business entity, let's say  operating in the UK, regardless  of whether or not you want to route all your money  through Ireland, regardless of whether or not  you want to claim that all the server data is  stored on the US. But since  you want to say all that stuff, I guess we can't  possibly get the data off your server.  And now you've got, you know, you're going to have  countries saying, I don't care where the data  is. You're a business doing business  here. Right. We want that information  to deal with our legal processes.  And in some cases, there are legitimate reasons  to say that. In some cases, not legitimate.  Right. But it's sort of  this like calling bull on  this whole, well, it's not located in the country.  Therefore, I guess we can't  touch it because data  only lives in  and only has jurisdiction on the  part of the cloud. If  you run a cloud, if you're Google that runs  a worldwide cloud,  the argument that, well, you can't get to the data  with your legal  request because it's in the US doesn't hold up.  It holds up even less.  And it holds up even less when you've got the US  running around just getting the data itself  whether it wants, without legal processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have governments, including  Canadian and European.  And for a while, Brazil  trying to insist that  their citizens data had to be held  in their countries. Now,  there was two reasons for that. One was supposed to protect  it, but also the other reason, because it made  it more susceptible to subpoenas  of those governments in those  countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you're absolutely right, Danny.  But I kind of like this phony dance  because it kind of preserved the integrity  overall. Now, if a country,  any country says,  well, we don't, you know,  China says we don't want any information  to show up on Google  about Falun Gong  and then enforces  it worldwide,  there goes any information about Falun Gong, whether you're  in China or not.  And that bothers, that worries me. Doesn't that  not worry you? I mean, I agree it was a fiction,  but it was a useful fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no. I mean, there's all sorts of things  that I get worried about on  when you want to make data requests or you want to make  censorship requests and everything. But I  think we're about to go into this  new era of  the myth of  well, this is only happening  on this server, or this is only happening  in this country. I think that's going to change.  But it's going to make, but  we know that, but it becomes much  more complicated if you're a politician, you get  called out on it. Because now you  can't, because now you have to decide  do I want to turn this  into an international incident?  Yeah. So maybe the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, maybe then the right way to do this is  be honest and say it's everywhere. Now  what are we going to do? But the Chinese  government can still rule, hey, we're going to block  you have to block all search results from  going worldwide. Then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's  the problem I had with  Sarkozy and with  Vivian Redding. Vivian Redding  in Europe said I want Europeans  data held to European standards all around the world.  I'm going to dictate this. I'm going to dictate law  around the world. Well, then that's nothing that stops the  government of China or Iran or so on saying  we want the same freedom.  Or if Germany says you cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sell Nazi memorabilia  on eBay, you only change that in  eBay Germany, but you sell Nazi memorabilia  throughout the west of the world.  Now this is maybe a... Now Germany says no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Then what? You have to pull out of  Germany? So you end up with the lowest  water market freedom and the highest water market  regulation. And that's my fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate that. So what's happened,  Danny, is we had a useful fiction, which everybody  knew was a fiction, but at least  it protected.  You know, it didn't bring us to  the lowest. You start to understand the rationale

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  behind Sergey's, I mean Larry's Island.  Right? So  take one of those hover  domains you had, you know,  freeleport.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His island

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doesn't protect him from  doing business in other countries that  are still going to find ways to  regulate and demand stuff that  they want. So how do we solve this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we need an international court.  Maybe this all needs to go international.  I don't want any government involved in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem. Governments are going to hold  together. The institutions of old are going to hold  together on this against this disruptive  force. Well, I bet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you ask how you're going to solve it.  And yet, but when you talked about Jeff, about  people in Brazil, one of the data stored there  or whatever, it's like at the same time  the place that you thought was supposedly  the safe place for all this stuff, the US.  You've got people outside the US going, well, I don't  want my stuff stored in the US because apparently they just  spy on it all. Yeah.  So, you know, I need a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dark net. We need an underground net run  only by the technical elite, the hackers  of the world, and just  keep government out of it. What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  No? Okay.  I think that there's  a place in the world for  rule of law and I think that we should have reasonable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  laws. There's a lot of place for the rule of law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And I think we should have reasonable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  laws. But should it be the lowest  common denominator of freedom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I think that if  Google were serious about  not wanting the censorship to happen in the EU,  for example, they would say,  okay, we disagree with  this right to be forgotten  and that it's implemented so badly that  we won't do business there or  we won't follow this law. Oh, come on, Danny.  They're not going to. I know that, but you ask  how you make change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders  and full disclosure, I am one in a small  tiny bit, to run  the company well. You're not  going to cut off all of Europe  because you get pissed off with it. You just can't do that.  They did it to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they didn't really.  They did do it in China. They  pulled off of China. They're not  running. But A,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they were prevented from doing meaningful  business in lots of ways there. B, they still  serve Chinese consumers through Hong Kong  and through dot com and it still works.  But in the way that they want it and what Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  could say is, look,  we are going to, you know, I mean,  I agree with you.  They're not going to do it.  But they're not going to do it  because it is too expensive  for them to do, not because it would be the right  thing to do.  By the way, did they not go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  into China? Did they not find, you know,  after the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They ran a, they don't  do the censorship anymore.  If you try to go to Google China  with the Chinese extension,  you, I think, either get redirected  or whatever. Google dot CN goes to Google dot  HK. Right. And then in Hong Kong, they just do  whatever they want. And I can't  recall what the situation is with their business  operations that are there. I think they can still  have business operations. But  by virtue of not  acceding to the censorship demands,  they made it more difficult for them to try  to grow the market share that they were already struggling  with from the earlier hamperings  that they had. They also, the Chinese made it virtually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  impossible for any foreign company to succeed  there. So they weren't succeeding anyway. Right.  So maybe the only hope is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  countries like China,  rulers of countries like China,  see the  detriment to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but there's no detriment to China because  now Chinese Twitter  and the Chinese Google and the Chinese this and the Chinese  that are all succeeding. Right. Yeah.  Why Bo? Yeah. And eBay and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  blah blah blah. So I was reading  my favorite magazine. I love it because  well, for instance, the best dresses  to wear this season, 40 wedges  guaranteed to make your summer easier.  Sixteen of our favorite  brunettes. And all of a sudden, I'm  reading an article, low and behold,  about a Google  employee, Google's security  princess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was getting ready to be all upset that this was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sexist and horrible. I was too. But  wait a minute, before you get to the good part, because it is  all right. But I do have to read this.  Tabriz appears to wear black  almost exclusively. It's slimming,  she says, shrugging. Not that she  needs to worry about that. She has a  simpatico face, always worn  bare, that could easily lead from  one ethnicity to another. And a classic  gap in its head, a sleek  tomboy aesthetic, dark washed jeans,  clean lined crewnecks, and Chuck  Taylor's with the occasional bomber jacket  thrown on top. And as was when I read  that, I thought. I thought, oh crap.  But it turns out  Tabriz, who is  in charge of security, information  security at Google,  and yes indeed her card does say security  princess, this is actually a great  article. And it's  related to, this is Elle magazine,  which is a fashion magazine, and it's related to  their Elle's Women in Tech  series. There's an article  Why We Need Women Who Code.  And despite that one  paragraph, a lot of this is actually  pretty good, isn't it, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's well written. And the fact that  she has the irony to make  that her own title is kind of delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's a profile  of her, and it really talks about her  as an intelligent person. They talk about  stegan, I don't know why I'm seeing  an Estee Lauder ad, but that's  It was time.  I don't, oh, well wait  a minute. Maybe I do need Estee Lauder  lipstick.  They talk about steganography and how she  used steganography.  This is actually  an article worthy of Wired Magazine.  They got a good  writer to write about it, despite that one paragraph about fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, don't we see from the issues of  misogyny going on with technology companies,  and we don't have to go into the catalog. There's been a lot  of them recently.  I think you've got to attack that from both ends.  And one way is to  a women audience, I wish, you know, we're here for  this discussion today. I do too. To make it more  appealing, to make it more  something to aspire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to. They talk about Google's  struggle to get more women in Google.  I think that's a great way to talk about  Tabreeze's, she says she doesn't perceive  gender as a negative for her, although she's one of the  few women and has always been  in her field. She thinks she  quote, maybe a little more pushy than the female  stereotype. Among the women she mentors,  some continue to struggle to navigate Google's  at times Darwinian environment, she says,  where you have to kind of demonstrate  authority without explicitly having it.  That's a very good description, by the way.  It is.  You know, kudos to  who wrote this article, and apparently  is doing other articles along with 40 Wedges,  guaranteed to make your summer easier,  about women in technology  and why we need women who code.  That's great. And I think you're right.  I think this is where you, this is  a very important part of the front, is to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got to have a push and a pull. You've got to push the guys  to understand better, but we've got to pull the women into  technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  And they've got beautiful  pictures of Marissa Meyer and other  women in technology. Grace Wu  at Pixel I.O. Genevieve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not sexist on me, but  I've got to see what's Marissa wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see if I can find her. Actually, maybe  they eschewed her because she's so well known.  SpaceX, the operations  lead and CFO at Square,  Code for America, there's  Kara. There's Kara. Looking good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice leather jacket. She keeps the leather jacket.  I think Elle provided that jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm guessing.  No, they do not have, they mentioned  Kara. There's Katerina Fague, who  we love.  Who is totally awesome.  Anyway, thank you Elle.  I was so prepared to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh God. Yeah, I was too.  That's why I put it in, it was like, you know,  chart beat, you share  before you read. I stuck it in the  rundown and then  clicked on the link and said, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Actually, I did the same  thing. I bookmarked it.  I want to make sure we get everything in you guys want to talk about.  So if there's any story that I have missed.  There was so much stuff.  It's a jam packed day and we're almost out of time.  So I don't want to go crazy.  Quartz talks about how busy Mark  Andreessen has been on his  Twitter. He joined Twitter in 2007,  but for some reason, January 1st of this year,  decided to start tweeting in tweets  every 10 minutes.  He's amazing.  P. Marka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Fred Wilson has done some  tweets about  really admiring the  Can we say that Andreessen invented the  tweet storm? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't invent it, but he has mastered it.  He has mastered it and popularized it.  He's basically writing entire  articles. Re-invented it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suppose. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's the way  to put it. Yeah. And  but then the key to him is that once he  does that, then he goes into conversations.  I actually have an Andreessen  column on my tweet deck.  I don't have a column for any other individual  user on Earth. Wow. But to try to make  sense of Andreessen, I  dedicated one to him.  And Twitter needs some better  functionality because you can't really  judge the conversations. The threads don't hold  together. It needs a lot more work on this, which  Fred Wilson kind of acknowledged in some tweets  about this. He's admiring  at what Mark has done.  And it's hard. I've done a few where I've  gone to four or five and it doesn't hold together very well.  When I asked him about this,  whether he  kind of wrote them out ahead of time  and no, it's  You get the feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you look at where he's tweeting,  it's like right after meals.  So I think it's in the crapper. But  just a thought.  I wouldn't speculate.  FCC has given us  a few more days to  comment on an open internet.  You can email openinternet.fcc.gov  comments  so far was to close  on Monday. This is of course on the FCC  server out again.  Yay. Keep up the good work,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  folks. I called into Howard Stern today  to urge his viewers. He had John Oliver  on today. Before John arrived, I called  in to say everybody's got to do this.  I filed my comment on  Buzz Machine if you want to see it. Good.  We all should be filing to the FCC.  I want to see a million by Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you haven't seen John Oliver's  screed against cable company  EFRI, aka  open internet  or pro open internet, aka  anti-net  discrimination.  Do watch that on his show.  See the terminology was really...  Double negatives all...  He's saying you shouldn't be calling it  I'm for net neutrality. You should say I'm against  cable company EFRI.  It's on his...  What is it called? The week ahead?  The week behind? Last week? Last week tonight.  Last week tonight.  Which is a great show. Yeah, and you can see it  on YouTube. It's 15 minutes well spent.  And then  email openinternet.fcc.gov  or visit the FCC's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  own site where you can... Or else we're going to have  people like Comcast in charge of our lives  and Veronica Belmont and Ryan  Block certainly know what that looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw this when they posted it on  Google Plus and immediately said  I'd love to play this on the radio show. Little did I  know that every media outlet in the world  would pick this up within minutes.  TV is everywhere. It's on the Today  Show, it's on the nightly news, it's everywhere.  I'll play a little bit of it. You've certainly heard it by  now. Veronica and Ryan  are moving and  of course good friends of the Twitter.  And they're moving. He was the former  the founder... Well not founder, but  former editor-in-chief at Engadget. Founder  of...  I forgot...  Geek, right?  What is it called?  Digit?  Gadget.  Brilliant guy, great guy, regular on Twitter.  So is Veronica.  And  they were moving and they wanted to cancel their  Comcast service and take up a new  service called Astound, another provider.  Brian  is in the other room while Veronica is trying to do this  and after about 10 minutes of hearing her get more and more  frustrated, he gets on the line  and records  the conversation  with one of the most

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  aggressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  retention  specialists  I've ever heard, a Comcast representative.  Comcast apologized via Twitter  almost immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to  talk about this in Comcast because I don't owe you an explanation.  So if you can please just go  proceed to the next question. If you have to fill out  your form, that's fine. Please proceed  to the next question and we'll attempt  to answer that if possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean,  being that we are the number one  provider of internet and TV service in the entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  country... The guy will not take no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for an answer. But you know what's beautiful  about this is that Brian uses  a customer service tone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does not lose his temper  which I would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have been going  to the Zerco  Nutt-O  My kids can tell you what that sounds like.  But no, Ryan stayed  extremely calm and just said  are you done? Are you done now sir?  Can you go to the next page because I want to cancel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they finally, the guy says well I've already  done it. And then Ryan says can I  have a confirmation number? He says no.  What we've,  first of all Comcast admits it's an employee.  It's not some third party. This was an employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also Comcast doesn't admit  this is the culture they created.  Right. They try to blame the employee  or we're embarrassed about this employee. I'm sorry  no. This guy is doing this  because he's afraid he's going to get shot when the  prisoner escapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that we agreed, we talked about this  I think yesterday or the day before.  I think we agreed that  the likely case is  that this representative, it will cost him money.  It will cost him a bonus  for every  person who cancels on that phone call.  So the guy is fighting for his life.  This is not about  Comcast, this is about money.  And so whether Comcast  is embarrassed or the guy is poorly  trained is not the issue. You create  this culture by rewarding  people for not letting people cancel.  And one hopes  that Comcast will get a better idea  thanks to this.  Somehow I doubt it. Anybody who's ever  spent any time on Comcast. The worst thing that  happens, this has happened to me because I've had similar  conversations, is that you  get tagged by the  office of the executive at Comcast.  I think it was because I'm an internet  broadcaster, radio broadcaster.  But for some reason I kept getting calls  from them and they're even worse.  They're supposed to be nice.  They're supposed to  oh no, Brian  really cares and wants to make sure you're happy.  But it ends up being worse.  I end up yelling at her too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gotta say, this stuff's not uncommon.  What surprised me though  was I had in like  the past two months I had two things that  I had called AT&T.  You know,  if you're dealing with your cell phone you don't normally think this is going to be great.  But I had called them because I was trying to  check on the new plans.  They'd come out with this new  plan for the family plan or whatever  and it ended up like  reducing my bill like  They put me on it  and I was like yeah, we'll move you over to  this is much better. You should be on this sort of plan.  Then I went and I got a new phone and they're like  yeah, we're going to give you this new phone.  I bought the new phone and I'm like oh,  I want to pay full price and I don't want to be on the contract  or whatever.  Then they're like okay, by the way we're going to take $100  off because you've been a regular customer  for so long. I was like what?  I don't understand what's going on here.  Then the other day, Time Warner,  this was like last week, I get an email  from Time Warner because there are cable companies  here and we don't use cable.  We might just use them for the internet. They're like we've sped  up your internet speed and you  just need to order this new thing, box,  and we'll send it to you. So I'm like  oh, okay. So I get the new box  and I plug it in and  having some trouble with it. And of course,  I plug it in at like 1am.  Right? And I call  and somebody answers the phone right away  and they talk me through it and I get it all  going and I went from like 10  megapixel whatever to like  to 30. I mean like  I have speed like I can't believe.  And then I was having problems with the router and they sorted all  that out and I was like I'm sorry,  I thought you were like my cable company. I was supposed to  hate you.  I mean I really, I was like,  I was like, you know, so  I've been in that kind of situation  that Ryan's been. I've gone through that with like Verizon  when they kept changing my hotspot  and they started charging me for a hotspot they didn't.  I went to the iPhone and  suddenly the hotspot that I never got charged  for, they started charging me $30 a month  for even though I paid full price for the iPhone.  And I can't tell you the number of conversations  I've had with Verizon where they just go  round and round like, well we don't offer  that plan. I'm like, I know you don't offer  that plan but that's what I was paying  and that's the reason I paid for the new phone and you're  supposed to give me the same thing I had before.  So why isn't somebody just enabled to do this?  Try to get the Nexus 7 connected

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with those bozos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well I mean, and so  Now you know why Jeff's so angry.  But in contract, it has driven me  so much in insanity  with Verizon that I am  seriously thinking about just leaving them entirely.  I mean I have three different phone providers  because you know, you go out,  because you do it professionally, you want to have  every debt work and you can cover the stuff.  And so I look at the  Comcast thing and I think, yeah,  you know, you're maybe going to lose some  people because you didn't manage to retain them.  But the better way to retain us would just  be better customer service even if we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to leave. Well that must be apparent to  Comcast at this point because this is  a huge black market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you think it would be apparent to them but  what happened with the whole Comcast guy  and all that stuff and all these  things and I'm waiting for my  you know, how could you still be  having this sort of thing happen now? It also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  costs you in another way because I mean  they also realize that in many  cases you don't have a choice so I don't  have a choice. If I'm going to have cable TV it's going to be from  Comcast. But it  does cost you in other ways, Comcast. For instance,  I really want Turner Classic movies  on my Comcast. I've gone online and  tried to do it, you can't. And I am  not going to call a Comcast representative  because I loathe every time  I've talked to Comcast. My blood pressure's gone through  the roof. So you've, in effect,  I want to spend more money with you and I  won't because I don't want to talk to you.  That's not the kind of reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you want in the world. It could affect  what it could really affect  is Congress can latch onto this now  and say, well you're going to let these people merge  and become an even bigger cable company?  This is how they treat customers? Exactly.  That's the real impact  here. Veronica Belmont and Ryan

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Block have single-handedly blocked  the Time Warner-Comcast merger. Right  on! We should hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing is, I didn't read the story yet  so I'm doing the  horrible thing of sharing  before I read, but I saw  a link go by right before we got on the show  that part of the reason that Ryan wanted, the two of them  wanted to shift was because of Comcast's  net neutrality stance. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I put a link up. He says  we told him our reasons. You may think we're  being intransigent, but we actually told him several  times our reasons. That was not the  reason the representative continued to harass us.  He just simply did not want to cancel.  Very simply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't  great. I didn't put up with it.  A young girl has already made a song out of it.  I'm sure there's many. It's going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope it goes forever. I just  live on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I only wish we'd had the first  ten minutes of Veronica going bad.  Poor Veronica. She's sweet.  She would not.  Well, obviously she got so  frustrated that he had to take over.  But his strategy is just  brilliant. He just says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he's caped the school and just  and I'm glad he recorded it.  And I'm glad he posted it. By the way, he  posted it on SoundCloud and it's really fun to look at all  the comments as you go along.  All the people posted because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he put a little... He was also great. He  took out the name of the rep and he also  when Comcast did apologize, he's very clear  back to them saying you should fire the  rep. This is a Comcast problem. It's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rep's problem. Although that rep  probably could do better in another

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  field. But I think you're right,  Leo. What you said earlier this week is that  it could be  that this is how they're going to lose money, that he  gets held to account, that he could get fired if he loses  too many people. God knows what  fear they have them under. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't necessarily blame him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is like Sheriff... What's his name? Sheriff Apayo?  The guy in Phoenix who puts male prisoners in pink underwear.  You know, that's how they treat us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that legal? Oh yeah.  You can't put...  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apayo. Is that his name?  But cable companies treat us like prisoners.  They put us in pink underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast has to stop putting us in pink underwear.  Alright, we are going to get your picks on the week.  One more thing. One more quick thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want a quick Rorschach test here because  while we've been on the show, this has been going all around Twitter.  The Airbnb logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew you were going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I already read that thing. It's stupid.  I read an article about it.  But it's going all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now there's tons of it everywhere, Danny.  The interpretations are...  Let's go to Airbnb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I did an Airbnb  last month. I'll never do it again.  The reason...  I don't like it.  It's creepy. I canceled mine.  The person came over twice  and wanted to check us out.  There was a lot of misrepresentation  about who actually owned the place.  I got an email immediately from a guy who owned it.  It turns out that was the management company  that managed it called Air Envy.  And then after we  stayed there, and by the way, it's no cheaper than a hotel  and it didn't have any curtains on the windows.  I get an email from the  woman who does own it saying,  hey, did you see my Buddha toothbrush holder?  Because it's gone.  She's accusing us of stealing her ugly  ass Buddha toothbrush holder.  She sent us pictures. I said, I never saw that.  That wasn't there when we checked.  I'm never doing it again.  But it may be the new logo,  which looks a little bit like an IUD.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are putting many sexual  interpretations of this.  Why, that's a lippy's loop.  I don't know what that is.  It's an A.  There's a bit of an odd phallic view.  There's a vaginal view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad, show my screen.  It rotates. It rotates around a little bit.  And it's lively.  It's lively and it does seem  a little bit  pointy.  They have made videos  about it, explaining it.  Anyway,  Airbnb is not for me. I'm sure it's great  for people who like, I don't like  regular B&Bs.  It's too intrusive.  I want anonymity.  I want somebody who's in the business  of  hoteling, not like it's a hobby.  Where's the mini bar, excuse me?  No mini bar in an Airbnb.  Or maybe there is.  There was a stove.  There was a refrigerator, but there was no microwave.  I don't know why.  Enough of that.  Do you have a, Danny, I don't know  if they warned you, but we like to get pics, tips,  tricks, anything you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got an earlier,  I could hear that coming up, and so I  scrambled. But yes, I do.  If you,  if you were to type something  into Google like schedule an appointment,  you will find that  now within the search results, you can  create an appointment for your Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  calendar. That's the way  to do it, Google. That's so Gina Trapani of you.  Which means if I have Google Voice  turned on. Oh yeah, you might  be able to do that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schedule an appointment at five o'clock  for a dentist.  Schedule an appointment for 4pm  with Leo Leporte.  With Leo Leporte. And  Twitter. I wonder if I could do that.  Now Google's thinking. Schedule an appointment  for 4pm with Leo Leporte.  Don't say anything. It's a pity you can't see my  screen. It's awesome on my screen. My screen's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doing crap. I think I broke Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happens after last week's show,  tons of people complain that every time Gina said,  let's do it right now. Okay Google.  Everybody's things were waking up.  It's like the, I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  believe that story you were talking about earlier on the  Xbox. And what was  his name? Aaron Paul  of Breaking Bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently he's got, there's a great  Xbox ad he has. And he talks to his  Xbox. Apparently it's getting, people's  Xboxes are responding.  What a world.  It's one thing I liked about the Moto X. It was trained to your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  voice. Okay now hold on. Let's do a little test here.  Okay Google.  Search for  Leo Leporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And perks up the Snapdragon processor.  And that's where Android Wear's bonuses  come to the forefront. Now what are we  watching? When the screen is on, all you need to do  to initiate actions on the watch is speak to it.  Saying, okay Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that? It was a video  and in the video he said, okay Google.  That was the screen.  It was exactly  what you were talking about. This is the phone's  okay Google, okay Google, jumps  in. After it pauses  the video, you can watch, it pauses  the video that's playing. That's so funny.  And then opens up, okay Google.  And see, there it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See my watch now does that.  As well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had that happen because I do a lot of press  interviews. And so I've been,  there's been times where I've been like,  press interviews where they're asking me questions  about Google. And so I've had my browser open,  I've had my phone sitting there. And I'll be like  saying, well you know, okay Google.  And then it just  launched up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well,  I don't mind, it's worth it. But thank you  for the little trick, Danny.  You can schedule your appointments through Google. Jeff, you got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  number? Yeah, I guess, I don't know how much  of it you're allowed to play, but how can  I not go with Letterman's top 10  questions about the Google robotic mule?  There is a Google robotic mule?  A, there's a Google robotic mule. And B,  Letterman has 10 questions about it.  Alright, let's hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mule number 10.  Will it take away jobs from  actual mules? Number 9.  Can I keep him  paw? Number 8.  Will it get along with my  mechanical yak? Number 7.  Does it have that authentic mule  smell? Number 6. He's just  going to get himself. Number 5.  Will I need a new charger? Number 4.  How soon before it tries  to kill me? Number 3.  Does it kick better than Brazil's  soccer team? Number 2.  Frequently asked questions  about the robotic mule.  Can it do this?  Get it off of there.  Get it off of there.  And the number 1 frequently asked questions about the  robotic mule. Robotic mule?  You mean John Kerry?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can tell Letterman's  retired, can't you? He's basically  phoning it in at this point. He doesn't want to read it.  He's got a number 9.  My pick actually is  this watch. I like it.  Did you guys get Android Wear yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not...  What do you mean? From... No, I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? It doesn't have as much Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now as I want. Well, I want more,  but I've always wanted more Google now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but it's like, I'm getting  all these other notifications and  I want more Google Now stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got my calendar. My Amazon package has  been delivered. I've taken 2,429  steps. It's  75 degrees in Petaluma. It'll be 81  degrees at the high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went with the Samsung one too,  which disappointed me because  it's got that stupid clasp.  So I'm like at Disneyland and it flies all over  the place.  I'm glad I did the right thing then.  We bought the LG.  The LG looked nice, but then it's kind of... I like the strap better,  but it was kind of bland.  We were all waiting for the Moto 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Chad had a really good insight, which is  the technology is basically identical  in all of them. I mean, yeah, the Samsung has a heartbeat  monitor, but because Google  wanted and sent companies to add design  flare as a differentiator,  I think that's right on. So expect  some interesting designs. These are just the first.  I don't know.  I was not a fan. I've abandoned  every watch and device I've had, including  the Pebble, which Chad has.  This is a Pebble, but it's a little bit nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean to ask, is Chad considering  giving up the Pebble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would if I had $200 to drop  on it.  I'm still rocking the Pebble and I  still love it. Better battery life on the Pebble.  You have to charge every night.  This one will last about four days.  The Pebble will.  And the only other thing  is that I just cannot wait until  I get a notification on my wrist  and I can just easily say  reply and do that.  And I can't do that with the Pebble yet.  So that's the thing that I desire.  You have to tie it to Hangouts if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to reply, because I've used the  SMS app on the HTC One  and the Verizon SMS app, and in both  cases it refers you to the phone if you want to reply.  But if you use Google Hangouts, which is not my favorite  SMS application, it will show you  the entire context,  the entire thread, and let you reply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still trying to figure out what it's doing  because, of course, I use  Google Voice, so then I did that.  So it texted, but it sent out through Google Hangouts  and it went to the right place when I was sending something to my wife  but then it came up with my not Google Voice  number because, of course, Google Hangouts can't understand  Google Voice, and oh my god.  But, you know what?  I have the Galaxy Gear and I find myself  kind of missing having  a camera, which I thought was stupid.  Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, I took a lot of pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with the Gear 2, and they're not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was kind of like, you know, I thought  yeah, you don't need a camera on the watch  because it's so stupid. And then there's times I'm kind of like  yeah, it would have been nice to just  discreetly take my spy photo.  Chad, just be patient because you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know when the Moto 360 comes out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're going to be getting this one. I'll get that one.  Yeah, yeah. And that's the other thing is  there's too many  I assume in September  we're just going to see all sorts of stuff.  We're going to see an Apple Watch. We're probably going to see an Apple Watch.  I'm just sharing a little redefine the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe not.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're being sarcastic, Danny Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am.  I don't know. I can't remember who did the post.  There's been a couple of these where people are kind of like going  yeah, watch, who kind of cares?  And I'm like, I was really excited  to get the Android Wear watch. I've been waiting for it.  And like I said, I thought  especially because I have Google Now on my wrist, this is going to be awesome.  And I'm not getting Google Now  on my wrist as much as I wanted.  And if the iPhone Watch comes along  and it's, they don't even have Google Now, right?  So, you know, maybe they'll come up  with something that blows me out of the water. But if it's just  I can get more notifications, yeah, that's nice.  It's nice to be able to  glance at your watch and not have to pick up your phone.  It's a little less impolite, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually  liking it better than Danny, but I'm  also learning a lot. I'm learning the journalistic lessons.  The New York Times application  is just ridiculous. Because every morning it tells me  we have 20 new stories.  Well, no SHI.  I would guess that. Yes.  Yeah, of course you do.  Tell me when you don't.  Circa does a very good job with alerts.  The Guardian does a good job with alerts.  They have to be sparing.  Alerts also have to get to your Google Now point.  A lot more personal, a lot more relevant to me.  And they're not at all yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's all going to come because  we're basically using software that didn't even envision the watch.  It's kind of, it's like  Pushbullet. It's just you're getting the  standard stock notifications.  Presumably they will get  better at that.  Hey, we're out of time.  I want to thank you so much Danny for filling in for Gene.  It's always great to have you on.  Wonderful to have you Danny. Thanks, good to be here.  Marketingengineland.com  Anything else you want to plug?  When are you doing a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A podcast? I used to do a podcast.  I don't have any time for it anymore.  I got it right.  All I'll say is that we, at Marketing Land,  we want to start a new holiday retailer section  because it is  July and you should be thinking about holiday marketing  if you're a marketer. It's time.  On the one hand, I hate when people  start pushing the marketing messages to consumers  but from a,  you know, if you actually are involved in marketing  you need to be planning that stuff now.  So that's part of a new section we launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great to have you Danny. Always a pleasure.  And he's of course  at Danny Sullivan on  the Twitter.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  CUNY.  He's also the author of many books including Public Parts.  His latest in Google, I mean  Guggenheim the geek.  I'll get it right one of these days.  The other guy.  I want to say Heisenberg the geek.  Wait a minute, don't tell me now.  It's the guy who invented the printing press.  Geez.  You think you're old at 60.  If my mind's like this now, I'm in deep trouble.  I'm not even going to be able to do this from now.  Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The geek.  The chat room told you didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they didn't.  I just made it up.  And he also blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  That's where you can read his comment  to the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, hey, Quig Army.  Get on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open internet at FCC.gov  or you can go to FCC.gov  slash comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be an essay.  Just do what you have to do. Friday the extended it.  Do it, do it, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you recommend?  If they're going to write one line, what would you recommend?  I believe in a free and open  internet, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  Declare ISPs,  common carriers and give us freedom.  Basically what I said in mind  was it was the Al Franken rule.  We don't want to change the internet. We want to keep the internet from being changed.  There you go. Like it.
