Jeff Jarvis is in London, England. It's late at night. He's in his hotel. Hello Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey. Looks like quite a comfy hotel. It's the airport hotel. I have a flight tomorrow morning to Mexico City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are in the week from hell, aren't you? I'm in a month from hell. So the first stop was London. What were you doing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Quantcast. Oh fun. Which was really a lot of fun that I had a meeting that I ate dinner at the Frontline Club, a journalist club.  Tomorrow I fly to Mexico City via Houston for when if her World Association of Newspapers next week it's Berlin for News Exchange.  The week after that is Legos, Johannesburg, Miami. And the week after that it's Phoenix for news guys. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Wait a minute. That sounds like Gina Trippani. I must just be hallucinating. Oh my God it is. Oh my God it is. Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today I traveled from my bedroom to my home office and I did make it to the bodega for a coffee. So it's been a lot of traveling for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are you? Great to see you. Thank you so much. We miss you so much. Did you get frequent Brooklyn miles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. Yeah, I put in a few steps in Google Fit. That's about it.  And that's not to be knocked. That's not at all. It counts. It all counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on my Android Wear watch today. I have in honor of Back to the Future Day. I have a flux capacitor.  It even has a little dimo ribbon that says shield eyes from light. And I think you can set it to travel through time.  It's not so hard. Yeah, it is Back to the Future Day. And we're so pleased to welcome Matt Cutts to the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey. Are you still home, Matt? You're still at home? I am calling from Omaha this week.  What? Nebraska? Is this for family? That's where the in-laws are. That's where the in-laws are located.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they have better connectivity than you do, Matt. Wouldn't that be ironic? Very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, can we get Google Fiber in the Midwest just out of curiosity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we were talking before the show about the new Nexus phones.  And I guess 5X and 6P went out for review to select reviewers across the country. Our own Jason Howell got a review unit.  He's working on the 6P review for Before You Buy this week. And I just thought I brought in my old Nexus 6 just to kind of compare and contrast.  So the Nexus 6 is bigger, obviously. Six inch screen. This is a 5.7 inch screen. But I think in many respects, I mean, this is a plastic bag.  Shamu, we loved you, but I think the time has come to take a look at the next generation of Nexus.  And boy, I can't wait to hear your review, Jason, but I'm just impressed as heck. Any previews, Jason? What are you thinking so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really, really liking the device. No surprise. I mean, the design of the device with kind of the aluminum body and everything just feels really nice.  It's heavy, but that's OK. It gives a sense of quality.  Yeah, exactly. I don't mind a little bit of weight because it makes me feel at least in my brain, it makes me feel like it's got a solid build and it's not hollow and empty.  The bump, the camera bump at the top that everybody freaked out about, not nearly as pronounced as you might fear, although it might still bug some people.  It's there. It's there. It's not like it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's ironic because you don't this whole right side is unnecessary. The camera, the flash and the sensor on the left. Really, there's stuff over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They packed that full of stuff. Oh, there is stuff. Yeah, there might be antennas in there.  Yeah, that's that's where pretty much all that all the antennas reside as well as the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a plastic bottom here. You know, there's other places where the plastic the antenna can leak out. But OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they put it all up there in that little window. Stereo speakers like that. Speakers sound great, especially compared to the Nexus 6.  My car stereo is broken right now, so if I want to listen to anything, it's through the speakers on full blast.  So I've actually really noticed a difference between the two. It's not something I normally spend a lot of time with and I have on this this time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's play some music through here. I do love front facing speakers. I think those are. Oh, it's got an ad. That's all right.  I'm going to turn it all the way up. That's one thing that's changed. Skip ad. You don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Little Wayne, little Wayne, did you just start? I'm feeling lucky or something.  Well, it sounds good. I mean, it's not it's not super basic. Yeah, you're not going to get base out of any of these speakers necessarily.  But. OK. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm feeling unlucky now. I will say that fingerprint sensor is really, really nice. I mean, it's so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so fast. Oh, the only problem with having it on the back is then that's enough. Thank you.  Oh, trap queen. I like that is that you can't use it on the, you know, on the front. But big deal.  I mean, I don't think that's a big deal. And you can also do the thing, which I always do, where if it's at a trusted location or tied to a trusted Bluetooth device, doesn't lock at all.  So presumably if it's in your office sitting on a desk or whatever, you're not going to be locked in with all of those extra security features that you can activate in lollipop and marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll what I've realized is I don't enter my pin anymore because the fingerprint is sufficient and I don't always have to use my fingerprint because I've got all the other things active.  Right. So depends on how comfortable you feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have it in my, you know, on the, on the vent and the car, because the ways is my, is my means of getting around. And I just fear having to take it off. I put my finger on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Although if you tie it to your car's Bluetooth and you say that's his trusted Bluetooth.  Oh, ha ha. Cars what? Oh, never mind. That's right. You don't have. Do you have watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it works with steam powered engines, it might be okay. But yeah, well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sync it to your, your watch. And then if it's near you, I've been waiting to get a car with Android Auto. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't get any straight answers out of Audi about when the heck it's coming on the car. I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you'll probably put a case on it. So slipperiness is not really a big issue. I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I spent a day without the case and the whole time I was afraid. Yeah, it feels really, it feels very slick on the back here. Yeah.  So I put that case on this more. I think it was this morning and actually really like the case a lot.  But it makes me feel at least a little bit more comfortable that I'm not going to do what I did to my Nexus six with this.  Is it one of the ones they sell? Yeah, yeah, it is. It's actually, you know, it was part of the review unit package is what's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is clearly see it says Nexus. This is clearly a Google. It's really nice. Feels really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about storage enough? You think this is a 64 gig phone? Yeah, well, this one's the 16. The review unit, I believe, is the 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is it? 16? No, I don't think so. It says 12.2 gigabytes used. Oh, you. Oh, so it's the 64. Sorry. 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so it's 32, 64 and 128. You know, I mean, you don't have a micro SD, so it depends on how much you're storing on the device.  I think 64 is perfectly sufficient for me. Absolutely. But you have a 128 option if you really want to go big.  Main thing I care about battery life. Battery. OK, so here's here's where I have a disclaimer. I was going to be reviewing this this week.  I'm not now because this device is is faulty. Actually, there was something going on yesterday where my battery was going really wacko.  When I reboot it, it gives me before the Google logo. It gives me this big red asterisk and it says your device is corrupt.  That's the boot protection. Yeah, exactly. There's something weird going on with it. I contacted Google PR.  They're sending me a replacement device, so my review is going to be next week. I don't want to place any judgments on this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like things like battery. I'm just going to say this way. This way, Leo, get this way with one seven a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You took it off just before seven a.m. You still have 60 percent left. They think you're going to get past midnight.  I think that's pretty reasonable. That's all I would ask if I could just get through the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday I took it off at seven and by three it was like 13 percent. But that was again yours was wack wonky.  Yes, exactly. That's what I mean. Like I was like, OK, that doesn't sound right compared to what I've heard from people.  So I'm going to get a new unit and you've been using this one or not. Yeah, I've been using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is you know that that's decent slope. That's I would say so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, it has the fast charge capability so you can charge it up. Yeah, like type C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Matt Cutts is getting the six. Not the five X. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ordered the five X and now I'm like, maybe I'll order the six P and decide whether which one or maybe, you know, maybe I'll just have a house phone, you know, and then one for going out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's one way to solve the battery problem.  Yeah, I have my evening phone.  I think the battery life I've been hearing from reviews on the five X is not so hot.  OK. Yeah. So I think you want and you know what this doesn't boy, especially compared to Shamu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This doesn't feel that big. No, you know, it's a little narrower, but it's a little taller.  And I think between the two, I think that's the better way to go.  The Nexus six just felt too unwieldy when you're doing one handed operation and the six P.  I mean, that small change in narrowness actually makes a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait. This is I think this is going to be my go to phone for a month and the camera for a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, that's all. We know you well. That's my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's true. A month. Oh my God. That's incredible.  Well, the I've been using the iPhone six plus, which I really like and battery life on that is amazing.  But if I can get through the day, that's all I need. That's all I care about.  I agree. It feels really premium. Yeah, it really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nice. The screen is fantastic. It's a, you know, it's a it's a Samsung panel.  You know, the latest basically Samsung panel.  So right on par with what you get in the five and yeah, everything pops. It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. It feels fairly swift. But is this the replacement or is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is this is still the faulty. So it's still maybe messed up.  So keep that in mind. Yeah. Oops. Can't capture this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got to do the lens blur thing. All right.  Slowly raise your device. Keep subject. All right.  Now I can change the focus to here or to there.  I don't know. I guess not. I think you've got a little it's still processing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. Now we don't have the five X in studio, but Gina, do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? Oh, yeah. So you went with the little one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. I went with the little one. I've had this thing for three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So give us a full review top to bottom. We want no details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it so far. This is my first experience with the fingerprint sensor.  So, you know, unlocking the phone, that's one thing that's going to be nice.  But for me, it's a last pass. Yeah, I am always typing in my super long last pass password.  Just being able to tap my fingerprint. So much better.  I also had the first time for the first time experienced the thing where you like take your old phone  and you tap it to your new phone and it's just like bloop and it just sets up your new phone with everything.  That is amazing. Have you guys done that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually it's actually one of the winning features of Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And something you don't get with the one plus two because they left out NFC. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, right. Yeah. Yeah, that was really that was really, really nice.  I have had weightier phones. This is feels kind of light and plasticky to me.  And I'm kind of like, it is really light. Yeah. It's like the car door thing, right?  They try to like add weight to car doors because people perceive that the car is a higher quality.  The door's a little heavy and it has that like chunk when you close it.  Same deal with phones for me. So it feels a little bit flimsy because I'm just used to a giant phone.  But I'm really happy to have a one handed device.  And I don't know, I'm interested to see how how battery life is.  Like I said, I just charged it. It arrived today and I just charged a couple hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm still kind of finding my way around. So I'm playing with the blur thing.  So I'm making that in focus. Now I'm going to make this in focus.  It's pretty fast. Yeah. I feel like this is because that's a that's built into that's in the camera.  It's in the camera. It's one of the camera settings.  So the camera is very simple, but I like that. I don't mind that.  You get you get a timer, you get HDR. It's an auto by default.  You get flash. You get a menu here that gives you photos for your panorama lens blur.  You get a larger setting, but it's a very simple camera with video choices.  UHD 4K, HD 1080p, HD 720p. And you can also do slow mo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. I haven't tested that yet, actually. I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stabilization built in. This is nice. Nice.  I like the way you get to video on this, by the way. You just swipe it. Swipe right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Left, left to right or the other way to switch modes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard one complaint was that with a double tap of the power button to turn on the camera.  Yeah, that's kind of weird, isn't it?  Because it locks it and then it opens it up in camera. But now you've locked the phone. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see. Actually, I can't tell because this phone doesn't have a lock.  I mean, you're in camera. What more do you want? And with a fingerprint reader, it unlocks pretty darn quick.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, then it is locked again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Lack of OIS is an issue, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree. And Google had explained that they had a Reddit AMA a few weeks back.  And they had explained that basically the larger pixel size helps to improve that.  That's what HTC said with the M with the one, right?  Yeah. I just feel like no matter what, you get more stable images with OIS. So that is a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did order a new SIM because if you're a Google Fi user, you have to get the new SIM to use with the new phones.  Really?  Yeah. They warned me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if you stay with the Nexus 6, you're fine. But if you want to go with the 6P or the 5X, then they'd like you to have a new SIM.  Are these your pictures, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a slo-mo of a hummingbird shot with the 6P.  Is this yours?  No, this is not mine. This was a demo footage released before the devices hit anyone's hands. Isn't that cool?  That is really cool. Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Matt's Google cackle. Damn, we're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dang, we're good.  So, Jeff, if it makes you feel better, I also ordered a Ludicrous Speed Chromebook Pixel this week because I don't want any more lag when I'm on this week on Google.  I want to like, I've got to refresh everything.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We love that. I love that Chromebook Pixel. I really do. That's an awesome device.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I got the Ludicrous Speed. I can't wait for my Pixel C, but I can't order it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon, right? Sooner or later.  All right. Let's get to the news of the week.  Jack Dorsey, the new CEO of Twitter, apologizes to developers and says he wants to reset relations.  This is what, well, maybe too late since it was, you know, a while ago when under Dick Costello, the third party developers were bumped.  Here's a perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it fully under Dick or did it start beforehand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I thought it was beforehand too. Nick Bilton was here. He said, no, no, it was all Dick.  It was, okay.  Well, but then it says here Dorsey's decision to dial back that relationship.  Oh, no, this is his current decision. All right.  Going forward, the company says it will improve its communications with developers.  Quote, we want to make sure we have a great relationship with our developers and open and honest relationship with developers.  It's not about relationship. It's about APIs. It's about access.  Who cares about the relationship? Well, you know, Gina's a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina's also a very forgiving, nice person. She never slammed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't. Did you feel, but ThinkUp wasn't a third party app. That's really who got screwed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was not a client app. So my co-founder, O'Neill, who actually Jack quoted during his intro today, which was crazy, called the Matrix of Doom.  Do you remember the Matrix where it's like client apps are not allowed, right? But everything else, right?  So we were in an allowed quadrant, because ThinkUp was an analytics app, which in fact Twitter made quite a few announcements today that are huge for us.  I mean, they're making all kinds of new insight data available to developers. So I'm really interested to dive into that.  But, you know, I think that Twitter really did screw up at that time.  I mean, whether or not client developers were the biggest slice of the developer pie for Twitter, they were at least the very most vocal.  And people love, you know, individuals love their power Twitter clients.  And the fact that there are great clients out there that were getting killed because they couldn't give out a number of tokens was awful.  And it made people, listen, hey, when O'Neill and I were going around pitching investors on ThinkUp, you know, we were getting, are you sure you're going to build against the Twitter API?  What if Twitter decides to pull a rug out from under you? I mean, these are the questions we were getting from investors.  So Twitter screwed up their relationship with investors. And I think that Jack, I was impressed.  I was impressed that Jack started out with that statement today. I'd like to see him say client developers go crazy.  We screwed up. You know, let's I'd like to see them, you know, offer more in their REST API.  I mean, ThinkUp and a lot of a lot of apps use their kind of plain old REST API.  They're really committed to Fabric and their mobile SDKs. And they announced a lot of cool stuff today.  But now I'm interested to see, like you said, Leo, I'd like to see the access to the APIs change and not just just the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But isn't it also just it's about it's about assurances.  I have the same exact discussion, of course, with news organizations and Facebook and to some extent Google.  And there's no forever. But you need some assurance over time that we're doing this and we're going to and you're going to we know you're going to build on it.  We know you're going to use it and we're not going to screw you. That's that's really what matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's true. It's true.  And, you know, I have kind of defended Twitter in the past because I mean, I think out of out of all the big companies, Twitter, Twitter set an example very early on with their super easy API tools as a great API.  I mean, developers love Twitter and would, you know, could could build, you know, with one curl command at the command line, you know, get back adjacent or an XML payload, you know, very early on.  I think a lot of people cut their teeth on the Twitter API developing web services through APIs because of Twitter.  And, you know, and companies like Facebook, you know, change their API and kill access to various bits of data, which they do a lot, you know, for privacy reasons or whatever.  No one really blinks an eye because I think people just kind of expect Facebook to be jerks.  But because Twitter was so beloved in the developer community, I think they felt a deep sense of betrayal when the Matrix of Doom hit.  So I don't know. I'd like to see Twitter to try to repair that relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just removing token limits would probably be a great start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that 10,000 token limit.  I mean, no one would no one in their right mind is building, you know, or innovating on a good Twitter client because you hit I think it's 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, if you're if you're I think it's 100,000 if you're grandfathered in and yes, something's less than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine imagine what Twitter could be today if they hadn't screwed up with the developers.  Imagine what developers could have built with Twitter.  It'd be awe inspiring. I think I think I think there's a lost opportunity.  You're right. May it may or may not come back.  But at least I'm really happy that Jack's doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but you could make the argument that it was because of this that they were able to monetize.  Right. That by by getting rid of the third party clients, they forced people to use Twitter's own app and their website where they could directly monetize, which is hard to do with a third party client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They cherry pick the best ones and acquire them and then and then shut down access right for new for new client developers.  And yeah, the reasoning was, hey, there has to be an easy experience.  People should be able to go to an app store and get the Twitter app.  And I get that. I mean, Twitter was going through it was a very different time in Twitter's history when that all happened.  Twitter was just trying to reach regular people.  I think that that's that's less less of an issue now.  So was 100,000 users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a new Twitter application, you get 100,000 users and that's it.  If you were if you were already in, if you already had 100,000 users by the time they cut this off in 2012, you could get twice your current user base and then you're cut off.  So you could if you were a third party Twitter client, you could never do more than double.  And if you were and you there was no reason to do a new one because you could never have more than 100,000 users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a lot more reasonable than 10000, which is what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but still it's well, it was enough to end third party Twitter client development.  Right. I mean, there are a few companies that were already in the business that have stayed in the business, but the rest of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing you could do is you could you could attach a business model to an API.  Right. You can say that I mean, it could and it could have come both ways.  It could have said Twitter demands these requirements for advertising in any client, but it also could have said and you client makers can make money if you follow these rules.  It could have it could have helped build the business more, I think.  It could have made Twitter more embeddable in other places.  You know, it's just it's that's what it Twitter's culture was the hashtag and the outside.  We all know we're not made by Twitter.  They were made by outsiders and that's and that's so key to the cultural history of Twitter.  And that's what they betrayed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, if you're a developer at this point, I don't I think it might be too late.  There's plenty other places you can develop for.  Right. Why? Why take a chance?  He did. He did tweet.  He wants to hear your ideas and requests using the hashtag.  Hello, world.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he he he he kicked off the yeah, he kicked off the flight today by saying that hello world is obviously the thing that most people figure out how to output when they're first learning to program.  And he feels like it's it really embodies what Twitter is because it's a global communications.  Yeah. So so they so they went with hello world.  Yeah, that's all right.  Nice and clever.  And if you see some of the responses, they're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do one hashtag that won't be spammed with porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can figure Twitter will get right on that.  That's one thing.  I get right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, if I were well, never mind, I were of an evil mindset.  As long as we're in the Twitter, we'll move on and we'll get to Google in a moment because there's lots to talk about.  Lots to talk about.  But just a couple of other things.  Twitter has introduced polls.  Twitter polls.  We heard rumors about this.  If you want the public's opinion, by the way, G plus does this beautifully, fairly similarly, I might add.  You can create a poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two choices, two responses.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  It lasts for 24 hours.  Stupid.  To two choices, 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, never mind.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to open that up.  Two choices.  That doesn't make much sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's like 140 characters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's funny that, you know, they were like people use, you know, favorite, favorite if you think this and retweet if you think that.  And, you know, the polls are obviously a much more intuitive way to to give an answer.  But it just surprised me that it was two.  It was only two choices.  But, you know, that these these things that we're talking about all go back to the big themes of openness versus control and simplicity versus choices and, you know, maybe more than one choice is just too much for people to handle.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think two choices.  I understand.  It's like 140 characters.  It's an arbitrary limit.  But I think it makes it very easy to very quickly go, oh, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.  You don't have to think about it.  So I think that that isn't so bad.  I mean, I'm trying to create a platform that pollsters will use to choose between the Republican candidates.  You need like a ton of choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's about as nuanced as our TV coverage is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically will Trump win?  Yes or no?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it also seems like a great way to gather more data points about what your users like and don't like and so you can advertise them more effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should I see this movie or that movie?  That's the kind of stuff that'll be used.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's not the Magic Gateball.  It's a yes or no.  Do not kick refugees is the moral of this story.  Did she kick him or just trip him?  I don't know.  Cause to fall.  Cause to fall.  Why would she do that?  Anyway, she's facing trial in December.  She got fired.  She got fired and now she's suing Facebook.  She's a Hungarian camera woman for N1 TV.  She's going to sue for facilitating an online campaign against her.  Facebook played a major role in my situation, she said, and helped embitter people against me.  Otherwise, I was loving it.  Everybody else was happy, right?  Laszlo Shamwal currently has about 10,000 likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's called that?  So did she trip this person on purpose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one really knows.  She claimed that the Syrian refugee was tripped by Laszlo had changed his testimony.  One of the policemen tripped my son, but it wasn't as bad as the camera woman, he told the Daily Mail after the incident.  He fell into the ground.  That's a seven year old.  So his seven year old was tripped by policemen and then he was carrying him and then the camera woman trips him and he falls on her.  She says she's considering moving to Russia.  She has no future in Hungary.  But one thing we know for sure, we will sue Facebook and we will also prove that the refugee was wrong.  I don't know. There's video.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to catch the trip here.  It's hard to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the angle's bad.  We'll watch it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See there she is on the right here.  OK.  And here comes Osama and whoops.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Her leg goes, ah look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But why would she do that?  So she get a good shot of him falling?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  And she kicks.  Oh, she kicks somebody.  OK.  There you go.  She's just a jerk.  She did.  She did a karate kick.  Oh my God.  She kicked that little girl.  Oh my goodness.  OK.  Well, video.  You know, you need to sue the guy who invented video cameras because that's really that's  really who got you in trouble there.  Let's take a break.  We're to talk about YouTube Red.  I don't know what it means for me or anybody, but I'm sure our panel will figure it out.  A membership version of YouTube.  Matt Cutts is here.  He's some guy.  You may remember him from the Webmaster videos on YouTube.  I mean, Google's Webmaster Tools.  And he's currently enjoying life as a civilian.  We don't really know much more than that.  That cuts dot com slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want to read more, I like the idea that otherwise Matt would be wearing a Google  uniform.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm wearing a Google uniform right now.  Right.  Yes.  Not wearing his beanie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I imagine multicolored primary colored epaulettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I want to ask you about Omid Karmis Kortostani, actually.  But we'll get to that too.  Yeah, I'm sure you know him well.  And also that's Jeff Jarvis.  He's in London and he's about to fly to Mexico City.  But he's paused in his flight to join us.  I'll promise not to trip you.  Although it's tempting if you do run out of here, I might.  And Gina Trapani from Brooklyn.  Hello.  And the creator of not only Think Up, but now the new maker base, M-A-K-E-R-B-A dot S-E.  And great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by a very good thing to know about if you're one of the people,  and I think you are, who wants to learn, who wants to grow, who's curious, who likes to  take classes to make things happen.  I'm talking about Lynda.com.  Whether you want to develop an app, redesign your website, master Excel,  learn a new programming language, or just get better at your hobby.  I love photography.  I love Lynda.com.  For photography, for Photoshop, for Lightroom, it's the best place to learn.  Check out lynda.com.  They just added two great courses for beginners.  Lisa's taking the introduction to photography and getting started with photography.  These are taught by pro photographers.  In fact, people, the best in the business, people I know like Ben Long.  There's Ben showing you how to get started with photography.  This guy's a great photographer, but also a great educator.  I mean, I just, this is so cool.  There's also a five-day photo challenge, which I really love those challenges.  It'll help you improve your eye, you know.  Plus new courses on color correction, making selective adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw.  That's kind of a high-end topic.  Lightroom, Creative Cloud Essential Training, the fundamentals of Photoshop.  You start there, but man, they get deep. They get real deep.  And when you're learning from people like, how to use Photoshop from people like Bert Monroy,  you're learning from the best.  I just, I love Lynda.com.  Over 3,000 on-demand courses, professionally shot.  There's hand, there's, you know, transcripts you can read and search.  So you can quickly jump to the part of the course that you want,  or you can just watch it beginning and end.  That's the nice thing about Lynda.  And you, I always say you don't have to declare a major,  because with Lynda.com, your membership gives you access to every video on the site.  So you don't have to say, well, I want to do photography.  Oh, no, maybe I'd want to do Excel.  Maybe I want to learn to be a programmer. No, you can do it all.  LYNDA.com, unlimited membership, unlimited access with your membership  to training on hundreds of topics, one low flat rate.  And for, to give you a taste, for right now, 10 days free,  when you go to Lynda.com slash T W I G.  Let's see what you're studying there. AutoCAD, After Effects,  a little bit of coding, a little bit of photography.  That's good. Nice, a nice mix of stuff.  LYNDA.com slash twig.  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  So it's, I guess, official if you go to YouTube.com slash red.  YouTube red is here.  Ten bucks a month for a, quote, amplified video and music experience.  The application, there's no ads.  Watch. So we've had this with the Google Music Pass  with no ads in our music videos, but now it's for everything.  You can also save videos and songs on your mobile device to watch offline.  You can play in the background while using other apps.  And this is, is this for every video on YouTube or does a company have to sign up for this?  How does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TechCrunch says if you don't sign up, your videos get hit.  I feel like it's going to be for every video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I don't agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be every video except stuff like pay-per-view.  Okay.  Yeah, because so all the, it's like 99% of the content.  And then the ones who haven't agreed, you know, they'll have to work that out.  But it gets rid of all the ads, the pre-roll, mid-roll, banner ads, search ads,  home page banner ads, in video text overlay ads, all that sort of stuff.  But it doesn't take care of things like pay-per-view, paid channels or movie rentals,  which is something that most people probably aren't doing.  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically it's the YouTube you watch right now, but in an ad free experience.  Now it's going to screw the hell out of us.  I guess we'll have to leave YouTube because I can't, I mean,  we don't make an ad free version of our shows.  All of our shows have ads.  I just did an ad.  That ad would be in our show and I would guess they won't let me do that  because that wouldn't be an ad free experience.  Do I get some of that 10 bucks?  How do you say that you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The artists do get compensated is my understanding.  And they do say on the site you might see promotions or branding that the creator put in their video.  So, you know, they're not going to say you won't see, you know,  a van sneaker that somebody put into something.  So it's possible that people who upload the video with something in the middle of it,  you know, that still would carry through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you know, Matt, the problem, the moral hazard there is that rather than doing what Leo dish did,  which is to very clearly label commercial, you'll just be sneaking it.  Boy, you know, Jarvis, you know, you want to take a Linda course.  I got to fool him.  You're really ignorant. You're an ignorant idiot.  And I think Linda might fix that in some areas, you know,  and then that's not an ad, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. It makes it makes me want to do a native content.  Of course, I would never do that.  So I'll just guess I'll wait and see.  But it sounds like maybe all of our YouTube videos will be turned off as of October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other weird thing is to me is if I were ad sales at YouTube,  I'd be pretty upset because this this basically says, yeah, yeah, OK, we know ads suck.  This idea of the ads pay charge of the ad free experience devalues the other half of the business so much  that I'm not comfortable.  Yeah, you don't see even with Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't see NBC doing an ad free experience, even with Hulu.  Plus, they get ads.  You don't want to imply that there's something wrong with ads, except that we know.  Come on, everybody knows there's something wrong with ads.  The question is how they divvy up the 10 bucks a month.  Is it going to be is PewDiePie going to get more than some of the ads?  Somebody else because he has more people watch.  I presume they'll tie it to the number of views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a minutes viewed.  So creators who have longer videos, minutes and people watch longer might get a better rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're going to start seeing longer videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought I thought what I saw in one of the TechCrunch that's right was was, you know,  people who make shorts might make less if viewers don't stick around.  But I think the key is getting viewers to stick around.  Leo, didn't at some point didn't we talk about how you needed to take your ads out of your YouTube videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we were talking about how probably the last time you were here and an email had gone out to YouTube partners with the with the terms with these terms that if you do not agree to these terms, then you'll your videos will be hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  And what is the question, Leo?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually haven't. This is all new to me.  I don't know what I'm going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's here's the other question.  So so the thing is, most of the people would watch just let's just say twig for free with with YouTube's ads and your ads and whatever.  Are you allowed to put up two different versions of the same show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because I could only put up an ad free version, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they run either run YouTube's ads on them or there's there's a bit of an antitrust issue there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it says it's going to hide my videos, not just from the ad supported, not just for the ad free tier, but from the ad supported tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so if people are making are using this distribution panel and others to do things that have advertising embedded in them and they're making their own money at that.  And then this is a mechanism to get people to not be able to do that.  And only Google can make money through ads or this is also has an impact on ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's how I would interpret this is is the only people who can sell and run ads on YouTube is are is Google period.  And if you want to be on YouTube, you best not have any ads that we didn't sell.  Right.  I don't know.  Nobody I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, a friendlier interpretation could be just a way for YouTube video people who watch YouTube videos to not have to deal with YouTube ads, which involve the skip ad and the you know the the interruptions, you know, and that whatever your content is other other than that.  It is.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were going to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the only thing that I was going to say is just that I think you could still have things like pay per view and pay channels and things like that.  So I think that would provide a way to monetize.  But the other thing is if there are different avenues to monetize the content, then, you know, people could make money from the ads.  But then the artist could also be compensated from from this subscription.  And then that opens up ways where you can have, you know, more original content and more, you know, people who might be open to being compensated in different ways.  So I think that could be one nice thing.  The other angle that I haven't seen mentioned that much, which I don't think most people realize, is that this also goes pretty well with the Google Play Music subscription.  So if you already subscribe to that, you'll get YouTube Red for free.  So if you're already paying your ten dollars a month, you can stream all the music you want, then you won't see ads in YouTube.  Oh, that's great.  Likewise, if you sign up for the ten dollar a month YouTube Red, then then you also get a free subscription to the Google Play Music.  And so I think a lot of people hadn't realized that, you know, you would have paid ten dollars a month anyway to be able to get free music.  And now you can get free music and no ads in YouTube.  Wow, that's attractive.  Or, you know, the offline viewing and the ability to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But boy, that's nice that bologna.  That's kind of good.  Among all the usage of YouTube, I mean, you look at the kind of traffic PewDiePie has.  It's hard to imagine you make as much in the ad free version.  But, you know, I don't know.  We'll see.  I'm sure they've been doing testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So would anyone here pay for that?  I think I might pay for this.  Well, I already pay for Google Music, so I guess we'll I'll just keep that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to get it.  Yeah, that's kind of it's an interesting issue because it's my impression that a lot of people watch PewDiePie are 12 year olds.  And I don't know if they'll have the ten bucks a month to pay for free PewDiePie.  So what I think is what this does is it favors channels that and content addresses older users.  I'm sure YouTube has thought this through.  PewDiePie will continue to be ad support.  You know, everything PewDiePie is doing will continue because he just he'll say, yes, I agree to that.  And if it's 90 percent of his users don't pay for it, they'll get the ads just like they always have.  I mean, I look at my 12 year old, he's not going to pay 10 bucks a month.  I'm not going to give him 10 bucks a month to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'll pay 10 bucks a month so that my four year old isn't seeing commercials.  You know, that I would definitely.  Yeah, I mean, I watch TV because I don't want her to see commercials and YouTube and she mostly watches YouTube and the commercials are just annoying.  I mean, she sees commercials, you know, watching Sesame Street.  She's seeing ads for like daycares and cleaning, you know, household cleansers.  And, you know, she's four.  Like, I don't just need to see.  Yeah, I would pay for that.  So there must be I think there are probably scenarios with kids where you'd say, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think Leo, you're right. I mean, story out this week is PewDiePie makes 12 million dollars, made 12 million dollars in the last year.  And if if that went down some good proportion because some good proportion of the audience doesn't want the ad versions and the net and the net.  Well, or pick somebody else.  Pick pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it shouldn't because he if he'll get it presumably that the ten dollars a month will for ad free stuff will replace the revenue he's lost for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the question. What's what's the per user revenue level for each?  And again, I'm sure no doubt has been.  I'm sure YouTube's figured it out. Right.  Well, there's but there's more than one agenda here.  One one is revenue per revenue.  You know, the other is hegemony on the advertising.  You know, I don't know. We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as far as twit goes, I mean, I'm just we're just going to I don't know.  I don't I don't think we ever got the email, so I don't know what to do.  But if we did, I guess we'll agree to it.  But we can't remove our ads.  We're not going to remove our ads.  So it's kind of unclear in the FAQ.  It kind of implies that in in line promotions are allowed.  Are is something that's obviously an ad allowed?  I don't know. Actually don't know.  And of course, there's nobody, you know, I don't I don't know what will happen.  So it is completely possible that one week from today, all of our content will disappear from YouTube.  I don't know. I'd be surprised by that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'd be really surprised by that.  No one's going to be like, I paid for YouTube bread and I had to hear Leo like really his commercial.  Like, it's very it's very clear that the difference between YouTube ads and your ads seem very clear.  And it's not like I would lose a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't get a lot of views on YouTube anyway.  Most of our revenue does not come from YouTube.  Actually, none of our revenue comes from YouTube, I think.  Very little. So.  So.  And Glenn, do we get an email from YouTube?  I don't I don't I've never anyway, I don't know.  So this is going to be interesting.  It is not an accident that the walls are that Forbes had this article, by the way, this week on the world's highest paid YouTube stars,  because, of course, this is perfectly timed with this YouTube red announcement.  And the message is clear.  And I'm sure that these numbers are placed by YouTube.  The message is clearly look how rich you can get by being on YouTube.  And it's and it's in the face of competition from Facebook and Twitter and and supposedly Yahoo, although I don't know if that's real competition.  And I mean, it's amazing numbers.  Well, but it's a little confusing because it seems like they're not just this is they're including revenue from books and makeup and other stuff, not just YouTube revenue.  So that's yeah.  So the million dollars we quoted before could be the YouTube revenue.  Yeah, it's kind of I mean, you should read this and tell me because it implies.  That so, for instance, number four, Lindsay Sterling, the dancing violinist who's used YouTube to propeller to fame and six million dollars in earnings over the 12 months to June,  putting out two albums, a book deal and a lucrative touring career.  Is the six million dollars coming only from YouTube or is that her revenue, including albums and touring?  It's not clear the way this is written here.  Well, Michelle fan is obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here's the other thing.  Michelle fan makes a lot more than three million dollars from her business.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But YouTube stars, I realize how old I truly am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all very young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I just I just don't know them.  Like, I just don't know them very well.  My nephew, PewDiePie is like my nephew's hero.  And I just don't I don't really get like I get that he like plays video games and curses out people.  I don't know. That's my impression.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  That's how I know I'm really old.  So maybe you had a point earlier about how older people pay for stuff because, you know, I watch Netflix and HBO Go and all that.  But not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so here's the maybe it is just revenue made in the YouTube videos, but it includes products placement in the videos, I think.  As well as ads sold by YouTube.  It's not clear.  It's a very unclear.  Clearly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point is not the point is for somebody to read this and go, wow, I'm going to make a killing on YouTube.  Right. And I've always felt bad about that a little bit because I think there's so many people who get seduced.  It's it's like saying, hey, you could be a basketball player in the NBA and make as much money as Shaq.  And it's just about as likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure I'd go that far.  I mean, there's also people who are saying, you know, make it learn how to make an app and you'll make billions of dollars.  And it's like, well, some people do it.  Some people don't.  And a lot of it depends on how much work you put into it, how creative you are, all that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think it's a long shot, a really long shot.  But no, I mean, clearly, YouTube does wants to imply that it but you could you could be the next one.  So it's good to know that you get this.  I will be getting it then because I'm a YouTube.  I subscribe to music all access pass.  They don't call it that anymore.  Whatever they call it.  The Google Music Play Music.  Yeah. Play music.  I guess I'm going to play music.  So I'll get free.  I won't have ads on my YouTube anymore.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You'll also if you're interested.  Yeah. There's a YouTube music app.  So it's not just the YouTube app, but a dedicated music app for YouTube that you'll be able to play around with as well.  And so you can like look for different versions of songs and stuff like that.  So that's a pretty neat experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been incorporating that in, which is I agree is really awesome.  Anyway, watch for it.  Go ahead, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think it's a little easier to become popular on YouTube than to get your own TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you may not make 12 million dollars, but could you make a hundred thousand dollars?  Could you make twenty five thousand dollars?  How many people do you think are making a living on YouTube?  More than there are NBA stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NBA stars maybe.  But I don't know.  I think there are a lot of people make money living in TV.  I don't. I think it's about the same, frankly, because it comes down to the.  What's missing is the gatekeeper.  Right.  So there's nobody saying.  But but I think the gatekeeper isn't really the bottleneck because you still have to be popular.  Right. So assuming that the gatekeeper does a decent job of keeping the unpopular people out and isn't isn't blocking somebody who's potentially really great.  I mean, I guess I mean, PewDiePie would never get on network television.  That's obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The gatekeeper and also the number of possible star.  Right. Like there's only so many shows and so many hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot more stars on television than there are on YouTube.  But this is a new medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. I think Matt's point is good.  I think I think I don't know if it's the same with I don't know if I would say that's obvious.  You can make a living blogging.  So no, but it's so it's so it's the wrong analysis to say how many are there.  I think what Matt's saying is how hard or easy is it if you want to go yourself and if you do something that's popular.  I disagree. I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the big one is if you do something popular.  So it's not merely how hard you work.  It's how how people take to talent, luck and concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's similar in both in both media that have.  Yeah, that happens. The difference is the gatekeeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. But on the other hand, in more traditional forms of media, you have a lot more support.  And I know that's why you to build the YouTube studios and all of that stuff.  But really, you're not going in on your own.  The difference is the gatekeeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the difference is also when you can access a worldwide audience,  you can aggregate enough of these small folks who are kind of weird that you can find a niche that is like something that would never work in a small town or on network television, you know, whether it's, you know, gadget bloggers or, you know, SEO people or whatever.  There's there's room now so that you can take all the Dungeons and Dragons fans or whatever and you can make your own little channel.  Now, is that enough to live on and prosper and go big?  I don't know. But at least that's an avenue that wasn't there before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't I absolutely wouldn't argue with the fact that you could find an audience.  I'm only saying whether you can make a living because we hear I mean, I look at Pomp and Mousse is a really good example.  Jack and Natalie Dawn, I think, are very talented musicians.  They've done a lot of YouTube videos, many with Jack said himself, when I had a million views on a video, I made fifteen hundred bucks.  It cost me six thousand dollars to make the video.  I realized this was not a model and he started Patreon and I don't think that he's alone.  So can you become popular on YouTube and build an audience?  Absolutely. In a way that you can cannot do in any other medium.  Make a living. I think that's another matter entirely.  I don't I don't think YouTube and this is something that I kind of blame YouTube for.  I think YouTube, I guess my attitude is one of the things about that I don't like about these articles is it feels to me a little bit like serfdom.  I feel like it's it's a guy saying, yeah, come work on our farm.  You could be rich.  And in fact, what you're really doing is enrich is lying in the pockets of YouTube and not really getting much of a chance to make any money for yourself in most cases.  And when you highlight these 12 people who are making millions, you're really doing a disservice to young people who really want to make it in the business and are going to work their butts off and are going to learn several years down the road that that is not a way to make a living.  They don't pay them. The CPMs are very, very low.  And the rich get richer on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's one guy who's learned how to make a living. And that's the 23 year old Google employee who's living in a truck and saving 90% of his income. Did you see that story?  Yeah.  If I were 23 years old, I'd be like, wow, living in a truck.  Sounds amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The truck would have been kitted out a little nicer. You know, some more Ikea in it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got a whole blog.  This is not the first story of somebody who works at Google living in the parking lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  And Google is just the kind of place that people would just kind of shrug and be like, yeah, whatever. Right? I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we had this conversation about YouTube on Twitter with Jason Calacanis, who, of course, wrote a scathing blog post in which he said YouTube is a great place to promote yourself.  It's a terrible place to make a bit to build a business.  And I think that that's probably accurate that, you know, yeah.  But I just worry about the young kids because if you're a grown up and you're making it, I mean, I know what I'm doing on YouTube and I don't expect to make money on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Leo, it's another way around, too. I wrote a column in The Observer last week saying that with instant articles and AMP and all that kind of stuff, I'm saying the media companies.  Forget kids. I'm saying the media companies that you should consider building a new media property of new service to a community entirely on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what's going to happen. I think one of the reasons this YouTube Red is here is because Twitter, Facebook and maybe Yahoo are all saying we want to we want to build the next video platform.  And we are going to be there. Come on is we're going to be more fair to the creators.  And so this is I think a lot of what's going on right now behind the scenes is Twitter's into this.  Facebook's into this. And what are they? What are the?  And remember this whole we talked about this article by a YouTube creator who said, well, Facebook's got to stop lying if they're going to win people over.  But that's the opportunity for these other companies to say to creators.  I mean, you've got to value the creators, obviously.  We'll move on. That's fine.  I think we covered all of the stories in that chunk.  There. Let's take a break.  And if you're seeing this on YouTube after October 28th, good news.  Our show today brought to you.  It doesn't matter to me, but I think it does matter to the fate of YouTube a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  Here's a pop quiz for freelancers.  Makes their living billing for time and expertise.  What one of these is your favorite part of freelancing, formatting and sending invoices, collecting receipts and tracking expenses, following up with clients who don't pay you on time.  Now I'm getting just getting depressed or none of the above in any case ever once in a million years.  Well, obviously, it's none of the above because that's the hard part.  Everything is great about being a freelancer. You get to do what you love.  You get to work with great clients.  But man, billing for expenses and sending out invoices and following up is just the worst.  And so that's why FreshBooks is so important.  If you're a freelancer, a small business, FreshBooks is a lifesaver.  It was for me.  It's a super simple cloud accounting program that's giving thousands of freelancers like you the tools to save time, billing, get paid faster.  Let me be clear.  When I say program, it's a web.  It's completely web based.  So easy to use.  You'll make great looking professional invoices.  You'll get paid faster.  If people are slow to pay, that FreshBooks will automatically send out an extra email.  You'll be creating those invoices in minutes and sending them out, watching your expenses organize themselves.  Use a FreshBooks app on your smartphone or tablet.  And boom, that expense goes right into the invoice.  You tracking your time, you're billing your hours.  You're going to wonder why you didn't start doing this sooner.  You've heard me talk about it before.  Try it right now free for 30 days.  FreshBooks.com slash twig.  Got any questions at all?

Big victory for the Google.  I think it's a victory.  I think we can say a lasting victory in the Google Book Project.  To scan books, the federal appeals court last Friday dismissed the lawsuit brought by the Authors Guild over the digital copying project.  This has been going on for a decade.  In 2005, the Authors Guild accused Google of massive copyright infringement in a federal lawsuit.  Google had started scanning in books.  They'd scanned in, or they have scanned in, 20 million books.  And reached an agreement eventually with the publishers.  Actually, I think it was a court.  Wasn't it a court mandated agreement, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  It was back and forth so often.  I can't remember who was on first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the publishers said, OK, but the Authors Guild said, no freaking way.  They went back to court.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says it's not infringement.  They said this unanimously, by the way.  Because what the company makes viewable online is so limited.  This was affirming a lower court ruling against the Authors Guild.  Now, I guess the Authors Guild could go to the Supreme Court.  There's no comment yet from the Authors Guild.  But this is a pretty strong, I would say, victory.  Now, I understand the Authors Guild point of view.  They're afraid that Google's going to scan books in their entirety.  And then the authors will never sell books.  But that's not whatever happened.  Google's using snippets, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also being able to analyze it so that you can find things that you otherwise couldn't find through search.  So it's not just what they display.  It's also because they've scanned them.  Now these works become more findable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that?  I don't know what page is that?  The Insights page.  It's got a funny name.  I can't remember.  Where you type in two words and it bases it says how often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the Google Trends.  Trends? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. This is the one where you...  Since 1890, the word hack has been used like this.  Ngram Viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ngrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ngram Viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  This is so awesome.  We've used it.  We've had fun with it.  Books.google.  It's part of the Google Books thing.  Books.google.com slash Ngram.  N-G-R-A-M.  So for instance, between 1800 and 2000, Albert Einstein, Sherlock Holmes, and Frankenstein.  Oh, that's so great.  The blue is Einstein.  The red is Sherlock Holmes.  Frankenstein has just taken off ever since the horror decade of the 60s, 50s and 60s.  Who thought that up?  That's weird.  Search lots of books, says the button.  But yeah, so it's things like that that's hugely valuable to society that does not impinge on an author's trademark.  And a lot of the books in this, of course, are orphan works.  They're in copyright technically, but nobody cares about them.  And those orphan works are just lost to society without something like this.  So I think this is great.  Author's Guild has not yet responded.  I guess they could and probably will appeal.  Google now says they have 100 million M-A-U's in Google Photos.  100 million monthly active users.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's in five months.  Photos is great.  No, it doesn't.  I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's awesome.  It's great.  I use it almost every single day.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Top photographed locale, Paris, course, followed by New York.  You're all foodies.  Besides people, food is what you photograph the most.  And they know this because they categorize it automatically.  The events you photograph the most are weddings, followed by concerts, Christmas, dancing, birthdays and clubs.  Now it's only been around for five months, so that may change, right?  I mean, Halloween, right?  People take more photos of dogs than any other animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's them fighting words to cat fans.  I'm surprised.  I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You drove cars to the number two spot in the list of things photographed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  I didn't understand that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You drove cars to the number two.  Oh, cars are number two of the things photographed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what is number one?  People?  Food?  Food?  I don't know.  Paris, New York, Barcelona, the top photographed places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just by sheer.  Barcelona, who would think?  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Babies are the top photo subject you searched for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Babies.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, this page is great.  It's public and it's the official Google blog.  And the good thing is what it really is, is giving you tips for, you know, search for pizza or try searching Halloween, pumpkins and costumes.  Try searching for breeds.  It knows breeds.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Search for car types, trucks, sedan, convertible.  You can search for the Eiffel Tower.  It says, we'd recognize it anywhere.  We'll add it to your places even without a geo tag.  You can have a private name label with your baby's nickname so you can find pictures fast without giving away their secret identity.  You created.  Now, I don't know if this is you or Google.  I would say this is Google has created more than 15 million animations and collages because you don't do anything.  It just does it for you.  The assistant does it for you.  But you can also do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe people have created 15 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Start by selecting photos, tapping the plus button, then select animation.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably automatic though.  I don't know.  Yeah, I would agree.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it's because I have more than 15 million GIFs in my library already.  It's just me.  Just me personally.  Well, if you do a lot of burst mode, you'll get a lot of animations.  I love that.  Yes.  I love Google Photos.  We've freed up 3270 terabytes of storage.  So I think that's what they're saying is that's how much we're using.  Is that 3.7 petabytes?  No.  What comes after terabyte?  Petabyte, right?  OK, Google.  No, you can't do that anymore.  This is the saddest thing in the world.  You can't say, OK, Google, do your browser on your desktop anymore.  That makes me cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can because I have a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  I still can too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, 3.7 petabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Petabytes.  Wow.  Yep.  Wow.  That's a lot of petabytes.  Chicken feet.  Is it really?  Do we know?  Do you know what the total storage Google uses?  It's a lot.  It's a lot.  It's a lot.  Many.  Many.  One, two, three, many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just the amount of storage that has been freed up on people's phones from backing  up to the cloud.  So just think about it.  There's a lot.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no word for the volume of storage Google has.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to know.  It's just big.  There'd be some great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Randall, there is a TED Talk.  Randall Monroe from XKCD did a TED Talk where he tried to estimate the amount of storage  that Google has.  It's actually really amusing to watch him go through the process and then we know what  the real answers are until we come up here where he got it right or he got it wrong.  And I think they sent him like some reply that was like on a punch card or something  like that that was like, nice try or something.  I love it.  But, you know, that's a pretty good TED Talk to watch if you can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can still do I could talk, but I have to click the mic.  It's no longer I can't just say, OK, Google to the that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why they get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they say nobody used it.  I think it I think it's a tech guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use my phone all the time.  I don't use it on my computer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, Google.  You hear that sky, beaches and mountains are in the top 10 things we take photos of.  And it's no surprise searches for me are very popular.  I wish they'd say how popular probably number one, right?  Number one search me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like I love these people don't realize they can search for me.  So it's one of those tips again where they're trying to let you know they can.  Yeah, that's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm doing it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am, too.  What I what I usually will do is I will search for I can't get to the search box.  This happens to me.  There we go.  What I will usually do is just click my face.  But what if I just search for me?  Let's see if it knows.  No, it doesn't. It's confused.  By the way, my favorite picture of all time.  And Google made an animated GIF of that, actually, which I have on my if you go to  leoville.com, it's one of my front page photos.  That's interesting.  Me did not work with me.  Me gave me a very random.  You just have a poor self image.  The time feature of Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Loving that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so much better than I mean, I love time.  The product time up and think of does a similar thing.  But what I love about the Google Photos one is that it's photos that I didn't necessarily  share.  So it's really comprehensive.  Right.  There's always thing they recover this day.  So this day in 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love that.  Persimmons.  Persimmons.  I don't.  Good day.  Some reason took a picture of Persimmons and shaved in the studio.  Probably a Harry's commercial.  Yeah, I love I love Google Photos.  That's just an amazing thing.  And with with unlimited free storage, why I just don't know why everybody doesn't use  it.  So awesome.  Yeah, this day is yes, it's it's a great day.  Awesome.  Yeah, this day is yes, it's like time hop, isn't it?  Yeah.  Which I love also.  But we do we do we do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do  We don't know what the monthly active users of Google Plus are.  A year ago when recode asked David best bris about it.  He said, I don't want to talk about numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good way to answer the question.  If they wanted us to know, we would know.  We were talking about that yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to break quickly.  Why?  Because Tim Cook gave out some numbers about Apple Music and stuff.  Why give out any numbers at all?  Why not just shut up?  Cook won't say how many watches they've sold, he said, because that would be of that's competitive  information that our competitors could use.  I don't know how they would use it except to know whether to stay out of the business.  So you get in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it's always a safe for me that they're not the number isn't quite.  Yeah, that's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saving the number, which is why you should say nothing ever because even when you don't say something that's that's saying something.  Google. OK, this is a good one.  Thank you from Burke McQueen for this one.  Apparently, as you know, we were mentioning today is back to the future day.  And a tweet from the main Google account about 15 new Gmail themes actually has a link to a accidental link to a confidential PDF.  Do not share outside of Google.  Project Flux with Project Flux.  Our goal is to give everyone the ability to explore any place and any time, no matter where or when they are.  I love it.  Our mission to make the world's information universally accessible and useful.  But here's Chrono compression time circuits and power one point to one times 10 to the ninth watts or one point 21 gigawatts.  And it will launch at the speed of one hundred forty one point sixty two kilometers per hour, 88 miles an hour.  This is so good.  This is so Chrono compression device.  Why, that looks like a flux chronometer.  Early tests locations.  Courthouse Square.  Blue's Diner, South Pasadena, New Peabody Ranch.  Hill Valley, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the USA Today logo today?  No.  Basically in back to the future, you know, there's an edition of USA Today.  Right.  That's, you know, Cubs win the series.  So they actually changed the logo to look like.  That one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's funny.  That's a good patch.  That's funny.  Yeah, USA Today is featured.  Like, yeah, yeah.  Back in the 80s.  At this point, it doesn't unfortunately look like the Cubs are going to win the series.  I'm sorry to say.  That's so funny.  Special delivery.

Transcript:  What did come true is the sneakers.  Self tying sneakers.  We have those.  Yes, we do.  It's on the run down.  Come on.  The last one on the run down.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a flux capacitor on my wrist.  Next Android Wear.  Nike is going to sell them next year.  Self lacing sneakers.  The first pair.  Michael J. Fox.  That's great.  That's nice.  You know, I actually tried to watch Back to the Future 2 last night.  God, is that a terrible movie.  It's free right now on Amazon streaming all three of them is the worst movie.  Hey, this is good.  I need this.  This fat men like me need this.  Sorry, Doc.  No, how we figured out how to.  And I like the vertical video to Nike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Michael J. Fox's.  Oh, did he shoot?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an animated gif of them.  Lacing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's cool.  And the note there from the designer to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nike designer.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do they do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are there's the gif.  That could be just.  And how does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's pretty cool though.  Nice move on Google's part.  A little competitive action here after if you are a customer of Microsoft or IBM's apps subscription, you can get Google apps for free as long as you're still under contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hard to compete with free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you're paying, you have to have an enterprise agreement with another provider.  And I don't know what happens.  I guess once that enterprise agreement expires, then you have to pay start paying for your Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and especially if you're looking to transition and you want to try things out.  It seems like a pretty good idea.  You know, try it out with no risk whatsoever.  And then if you've still got a one year contract you can't get out of, that's fine.  You know, just pick us up whenever you can kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have this on Windows Weekly.  Yahoo is abandoning Bing.  They announced this at their quarterly results call.  They have reached a deal with Google for search.  This is, yeah, it actually was a regulatory file.  Back to the future.  Back to the future.  Yahoo and Google have agreed to certain procedures with the antitrust division of the USDA.  This, of course, because in the past Yahoo and Google's attempts to share searching were investigated by the DOJ in 2008.  Actually, it was the ad deal I think that caused those problems.  So Yahoo abandons Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think Bing is still supposed to be 51 percent or more.  So I think Yahoo can use up to 49 percent.  Yeah.  Whatever deal they signed, you know, 10 years ago or something, Carol Bartz did at Yahoo.  You know, it seems like they did a very strong contract back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of interesting Google stats, Google unveiled a shopping insights tool that gives us some interesting information about how people  are using Google search and Google shopping and so forth.  It's a part of a long term effort to help retailers get deeper insights about users intent and context.  Is this where the number came from?  Oh, no, this is where the number came from.  Fifty percent of people do zero searches per day on mobile.  What's wrong with you, you people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Leo, this goes back to where you say people should never give numbers because I remember for a long time Google said for a long time, Google said we have over 10,000 computers.  And we said that almost up into 2005 when we had many, many, many more than 10,000 computers.  Well, this person is doing the math, but they're using a number that we gave, you know, in 2012 or something like that about how many searches are a day or how many searches are a month.  And so they just apply that directly.  And then they say, oh, there's this many active Android devices to a little division.  And here's how many.  But, you know, Google tends to say we do over this many searches and we don't update those numbers that often because they come back and bite you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the math 50 billion divided by 1.8 billion times 30, blah, blah, blah.  This is in other words, this is a stupid article, which I would ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was a smart idea to try to take, you know, bragging about active Android users versus number of searches.  But it's limited by how much information, you know, has been made public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. I just imagine those Google folks laughing at us again.  Google Maps now lets you add a stop along your route to check Gash and and what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And check that for ages.  You also want to be able to say find the nearest Starbucks on the route.  Oh, that's what I want. Yes.  I don't know if this does that exactly, because it could be there's one two miles from you, but it's off the interstate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're in navigation mode and you can search for Starbucks and then you can add them as a detour on the way to their final destination.  Right. Multiple stop. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it'll remember your final destination, too.  So it doesn't break your initial intention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And did we get the new Waze app yet?  Have you gotten that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't. No, and I buy it on the believer of believers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the Waze guy.  Apparently the big redesign for the Waze app supposedly came out yesterday.  Let me see if I got the update.  I don't think I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of updates.  Yes.  How long does it take to do an update of Android Marshmallow Marshmallow Marshmallow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on the Nexus six, right?  Yeah, I'm on the Nexus six to the Nexus.  You still haven't gotten it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seriously. Wow.  Why have you?  Oh, that was a humble brag, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no, I'm surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He installed it. No, no, he installed it manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I've gotten it over the air to most of my other devices.  You have?  Yeah.  Jason, that was below you.  Sorry.  I didn't mean for it to sound that way.  I'm authentically surprised.  Oh, you think the Middle Ages were in the 12th century.  I didn't mean it as a humble brag. I was authentically surprised.  You didn't get Marshmallow.  I thought for sure that sixes had all gotten it.  What's wrong with you?  I love all of you guys. OK, let's just get that out on the table.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you connected to the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an unlocked Google five Nexus six.  I don't know what it would be holding me back here.  But I press that update button all the time.  I am really grateful that they're doing monthly.  Yeah, your system's up to date. Thanks.  I am really glad they're doing those monthly patches  because that's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I got I got I saw it.  So it patched mine. I got all happy.  Yeah, no, I kept trying.  I tried to do it now on tap like five times before I realized it was five point one one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I felt like these are these are the it's the new monthly security upgrades, which is great.  Yeah, but not but it does kind of set you up, doesn't it?  You have to look at the size.  Yeah, it's 12 megabytes.  Yeah, no go.  That's the patch.  Well, then I guess I can't I can't tell if I've got the new ways or not.  It's much more colorful. The icons look better.  The maps are more colorful. Yeah, I don't think I have this.  But it's still kind of wavy.  Which I want. I like ways you want to stay.  You want to stay like ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm so used to it. I like it better than Google Maps.  Yeah. Well, it's it's the crap.  So something really nice, but but I'm so dependent upon it.  It is my the light at the end of my tunnel.  It is my North Star.  And what I hate is what I hate night mode on both of them.  Yeah, you like the white apps that I have to search to try to find where they don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably don't use the satellite view either.  No, no, no, never.  Oh, it's I was I was only at the moment.  It's iOS only. It's not for Android people.  Now I understand. Oh, that's ridiculous.  Ways 4.0. It'll be an Android soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, as soon as I get Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on the iTunes store now, but Android later.  By the way, that's the first time they've they've changed the absence.  They acquired ways all this all these years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They really left alone. I talked to some ways people about trying to do something with them.  And they just emphasize again and again, we're still a startup.  We're not like Google. We're a little startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't they getting sued by somebody who claims that they stole some of their map information?  I think that happened before it was before the Google.  I think it was even before Ways launched.  Ways is being sued by Phantom Alert.  It's filed in San Francisco Federal Court last month.  Saying that they used proprietary data from Phantom Alert without permissions.  Both apps share road, red light and traffic information.  And the way they found out is the way map makers always find out.  Ways was using the same fictitious location information that his company had used in Phantom Alert for just that reason.  We'll see what happens.  Suits monetary damages and an injunction against Ways and Google.  I don't know where that stands. That was a month ago and I haven't heard anything since.  Couple of little things. Oh, I know you'll want to talk about this, actually.  Couple of things you want to talk about.  Jeff, you'll want to talk about the fact that the New York Times this Sunday will come with cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it this Sunday or soon? I think it's not this Sunday.  Oh, it's not this Sunday? November 7th.  Right. And I think this is wonderful and it's amazing.  And I said so. I have one copy editor like Quibble though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The news is not virtual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's virtual reality means that it is a fake reality.  I emailed the PR people at the Times to say, is this animated or is this immersive video? It's immersive video.  There's immersive photography, there's immersive video, there's VR and there's AR.  They're all being lumped together as VR.  People are saying, oh, give up. It's a losing battle. But it's still early in the life of the technology.  When it comes to journalism, I think it matters. Is this a made up animated scene or was this a scene that you shot according to journalistic standards?  In which case it's immersive video. It's not VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The New York Times magazine, it says we'll release a new virtual reality film called The Displaced.  But what you would say is a new 360 degree video or a new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think some, just to say once in the press release that it's immersive video.  And then I understand that people are saying, well, Google is a VR headset and it's VR technology.  And okay, I'll let that go. I'm not complaining about the Times so much.  I got smashed. People just give up Jarvis.  So I know I'm being...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. Virtual reality is the wrong phrase to use when you're talking about something that's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other issue is when it comes to investment, VR to me is the last thing that's going to come because it's the hardest.  Immersive photography, immersive video.  Photography is fairly easy. You can do that now.  Immersive video with the jump and all that. It comes next.  AR comes next in ease, taking an image and augmenting it.  VR is really expensive and really hard.  And I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. This is not VR, is it? It's immersive video.  VR implies what? That you can walk around in it, that you can experience...  And that it's virtual. It's made up.  But even more than that, I understand you now because at first I thought you meant, oh, it's not made up. It's real.  But it is also not VR in the sense that you can manipulate objects. You can move around in it.  You can only passively consume it. The difference is you can look around. That's all. It's immersive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is cool and amazing. And one of our professors at CUNY is starting to work on this.  And I think it's all great. I'm not trying to nitpick the work at all. Just the language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you're exactly right. In fact, this misrepresents really what you're getting.  You're getting an immersive video of children who are uprooted by war.  A million cardboard, more than a million cardboard VR viewers will arrive in the Sunday paper on November 7th.  I'll get one. I'll bring it in. Of course, what they kind of neglect to mention is you have to have a compatible phone.  Which means a high-end...  Well, but not iOS.  iOS or Android. But it has to be a high-end phone. It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, anybody who... I mean, I can't see my... Not that my parents got the New York Times because they think it's evil.  But I can't see people who have...  What do your parents get? Grit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, your parents think the New York Times is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get grit and we're happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I get some Florida newspapers.  It's funny.  My poor father has thought, he always thought, when you grow up, you're going to vote Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the irony of this is it's maybe Republicans that are starting to believe the New York Times and Democrats who think the New York Times is evil.  They pretty much created the email gate issue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's black and lundo. And just for that one line, Leo, you're going to get about, oh, 4,000 emails and nasty tweets.  Oh, I don't care.  You shouldn't talk about politics. You should just stick to what you know.  You should be talking about...  You're ignorant.  I'm going to stop watching you. You said something about politics.  You know, people, those of you who say it, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it always makes me laugh because what it comes down to is I don't know anything about politics because I don't agree with them.  Exactly. It drives me nuts.  And anybody who knew anything would obviously agree with them.  So we now have a Magic Leak demo and I am so excited.  And Matt Cutts, I know what division you should be working in when you go back to work.  That looks like fun.  Oh, so Google owns this technology.  This is shot through the Magic Leap.  It says no special effects are compositing.  We're using the creation of these videos.  Magic Leap is a augmented reality system that lets you impose digital artifacts onto real life.  So we're in a real office and there seems to be a spaceship floating under that desk or maybe a solar system floating over the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a technology that Google invested in, but I don't think it's Google owned.  I think they invested like $500 million or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, no important clarification.  It's an independent company.  That's an impressive video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I'm being dumb.  How are no special effects being used in this video?  I don't understand what's going on.  Are they just overlaying the planets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you looking through the...  Their technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Magic Leap doesn't require a visor, right?  What do you...  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll find out.  I hope it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, Gina, when the alien was underneath the table, the table leg could go in front of it and it had a sense of where it was.  I think.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magic Leap is a computing platform, an augmented reality startup where the real world is your screen.  Now, of course, what we've seen before with augmented reality is you have to be looking through a visor.  Okay.  Oh my God.  Look at this.  This is on the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These people are not looking through a visor.  Those children were looking straight at...  Is it a projection technology?  I think it is.  I think it is.  I think it projects it into your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there has to be something you wear or some sort of...  No, they're not wearing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at...  They are not wearing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but those could all be actors and maybe what you're supposed to be experiencing is what the camera is seeing, is my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd still go to work for them if I were you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, augmented reality is supposed to be harder than virtual reality because then you have to register it with the real world.  Right.  You have to know where stuff is.  Yeah.  Having the alien go behind the table is hard.  In that case, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you could also augment the real world with just data about that scene.  That is also augmented reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of these shots, which are obviously staged, but none of these shots are people wearing anything.  So...  Is this the last thing you want to use to advertise the technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to do a bunch of virtual reality stuff back in grad school and they would usually use the camera looking through the head-mounted display or whatever.  Right.  So, that's probably what's happening here.  But if it can register that well with the real world, that's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cardboard...  Yeah.  The Mattel cardboard does that where it puts stuff on that disk and it uses a special disk to make the background like a screen.  I want to know how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really cool videos on the site.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you should have a little elephant on your shoulder, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would totally do that.  I would totally do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could have the good elephant on one shoulder and the bad elephant on the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know how this works.  Press it.  Yeah.  I don't think these are actors.  These are kids who are being surprised by whatever it is.  This is video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It only works on video.  It doesn't work in the real world.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at these children.  What are they looking at?  Really?  Look at them.  Whoa.  Yeah, they all react to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect someone is telling those kids to all act like a whale came out of the water.  You guys are so cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pre-candy for you all.  And I am such a gullible...  I'm so gullible.  Look at the kids on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or maybe they are actually sitting at SeaWorld and they just overlaid the basketball court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe in fact there is a whale.  Yeah, Gina's got it.  Oh.  Whoa.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a magic leap right with you.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Hide that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well played.  Well played.  The illusion is broken.  The illusion is ruined.  You saved yourself $100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who needs a magic leap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A bonus if you get it to poop, Jason.  I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, we don't need magic leap.  But we've got TriCaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I feel that they are not using any technology.  I think this is just happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Google, what is magic leap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does magic leap work?  How does magic leap...  Maybe they don't want you to know.  Apparently others have typed this in.  Here's a patent.  Oh, the patent has a wearable display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never get a pony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's never a pony when you expect one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are my eyeball implants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, I think it's important though that you mention that...  how hard this is to do, Matt, because...  Yeah, you're right.  You have to map the real world.  An immersive movie is...  And interact with it.  Right.  Oh wait a minute though.  They didn't work on glasses-free 3D displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you've got to give props to HoloLens,  because they basically took a Kinect and hooked it up to some glasses,  and then you get a 3D model that's good enough  that you can do the occlusion and the registration.  And that's pretty impressive right there.  So props to Microsoft.  By the way, have you seen the video where people swap facial expressions?  No.  Should we try it here?  Oh yeah.  If you search for...  I think it's SIGGRAPH swap video expressions or something like that.  This is...  So they basically...  Yes, that's the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real-time expression transfer for facial reenactment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so now what are you looking at?  You're looking at two people that have video  that are coming from two different Kinects.  And what's kind of strange is you look at the video on the left,  of the person, and then you look at what he's actually doing,  and he's not doing anything but moving back and forth,  but it's applying the facial expressions from the guy with the black shirt  to the video on the left.  This is what I was afraid of.  And so you can... yeah, virtual actors.  You're literally pasting expressions on top of someone else.  So I can control the video's mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the guy in the hoodie is just sitting there doing nothing,  and she's making him emote and talk and...  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it actually does a mesh, and it recognizes where the faces are,  and then it'll warp that face to match the expression  that it extracts from the other person.  It looks pretty good, too.  And add teeth when teeth aren't there, which is interesting.  That's right. That's right.  And so at first you're like, what is... no big deal,  and then you realize what's happening, and you're like, oh, this is crazy.  Yeah, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eyes going, wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  That's wacky.  Welcome to the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to be in a very weird world in about five years, I think.  There is nothing that's going to happen that...  anything... you won't know when you see something if it's real or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's to say what's real is real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  Whoa, dude.  Whoa, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just think, Dave, you could do a completely scripted episode of Twig.  You just scan our faces, feed us our lines, and we'll just, you know...  You could just...  Oh, just let the show go.  Yeah, react, relax.  We can go out and get for a drink. Get a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let the show run.  I'd like to have you all say, life's too short to threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, how was...  So you weren't here last week, Jeff,  because you were interviewing Neil deGrasse Tyson.  How did that go? Was that fun?  It was great. It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was great. It was...  I hate being away, and I started the whole session saying,  this is so good, it means I'm away from my beloved Twig podcast.  Oh.  But he's... We gave Neil the Night Innovation Award,  and then he and I had an hour-long discussion,  last minutes with the room, but it was just amazing.  He's such a showman. He's just amazing.  And out of the video...  Still on the video is him getting me about something.  It looks like he leapt to his feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, like, was he up and walking around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, he wasn't. I went around the room with the microphone,  which is what I do.  But, you know, he talked about journalism.  What's wrong with journalism?  What's wrong with journalists doing things?  And he's just so... The whole video is up online, folks.  And he's just amazing.  He's just a showman.  And the poor guy afterwards, we had a reception and then a dinner,  and he couldn't move a foot an hour  because of all the people coming around, obviously,  wanting selfies, but also wanting to argue about God and the universe.  And he just never turns it off in his generosity with people.  And his view is that if people are coming after him,  that's because he says, it's not me, it's science.  Yes.  Because they're excited about science, and that's what I like.  That's what I'm trying to do.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exhausting, though.  Wow. That's awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really cool, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a real honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. Well, we got to watch that. Everybody got to watch it.  I always, you know, see stories in the paper,  and I always want to ask Jeff about it, like this Amazon response...  Oh, yeah.  ...to the New York Times,  and then the New York Times executive editor's response to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then Amazon in turn responds to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm glad they're having a dialogue, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Such a weird world where Amazon and the New York Times are arguing on Medium.  Medium, yeah.  How did this happen?  Like, when does the New York Times start publishing on Medium and Amazon?  It was so crazy. I was joking around with Kevin Purdy.  I was saying, you know, the real winner here was clearly Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  And straight.  Yeah. So I guess the Amazon said that one of the named sources  in the New York Times article...  Remember the article in the New York Times that said everybody was crying at their desk at Amazon,  and it was a horrible corporate culture, and of course Jeff Bezos denied it.  And now this story from Jay Carney saying that what the New York Times didn't tell you  is that one of the named sources was fired from Amazon after attempting to defraud vendors and concealing it.  Which does tend to throw that ex-employee under the bus pretty severely.  Yeah, and that the Times hadn't really given the Amazon folks a chance to respond.  They didn't check with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This way it's funny. It's actually something that Neil Tyson brought up.  He said, you know, I got interviewed by a big magazine, and they got it wrong,  and why didn't they show me what they wrote?  Well, and our answer in journalism is because that would enable prior restraint.  We don't do that.  But then, you know, well, do you care about the facts?  And so Carney, you know, a former White House spokesperson,  Carney's complaint about Amazon here, about the New York Times here, is that, you know,  we made people available.  You could have come to us and asked, what about this source? Is this source credible?  And we would have told you that something was rotten in Denmark, but you didn't do that.  And then the Times' response is, well, we talked to 100 people, so it all averages out.  If this one egg is bad, we still have the right story.  And no, says Amazon, you're still you're relying on people and structures to make conclusions  that you shouldn't be doing.  And there is kind of a scientific model question there is how many anecdotes does it take to come up with the truth?  So, you know, when the Times story came out, I was critical of it because I thought that it was a bit overblown for what it was.  And I also think, you know, I haven't written this. I'm curious what you think about this.  I haven't written this, but I think that becoming primarily dependent on consumer revenue leads to the desire to show off for your consumers.  Now, in a tabloid that's called sensationalism, I'm not accusing the Times of that, but the Times, it strikes me,  has been trying to do more, wowie, look what you're getting for your money kind of stuff lately.  We went after Hillary Clinton. We went after Amazon. Aren't we big?  And in both cases, I think there are standards of what counted for the full story.  Don't hold up as well as they would like to think.  That's what I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  Trouble in paradise for Tesla.  First Consumer Reports yanks their recommendations saying in our annual survey of car owners,  a lot of Tesla owners were complaining of defects and problems with their vehicles.  Uniformly, Tesla owners said the service was great, but there were problems, especially with early Tesla's.  Not surprising.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, because the reports went from the best car ever made to we don't recommend it.  Yeah.  A little binary.  Yeah.  But the other thing is, in the one hand, I'm just so freaking amazed that quiet to the whole world,  Musk came up with a self-driving car and put it out in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, it does seem to be taking exits not, they're talking about the road not taken.  This is a video of the autonomous Tesla driving down the road and without instruction, taking a highway exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see that's on over there and these auto steer, it's on blue.  That means it's on auto pilot.  When I turn it off, it turns gray or disappears.  So I just want to see the cars coming to my left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to be brave to do this.  I'm also sure I don't want this driver just concentrate on the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Play attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're on the highway here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's gone 64 miles an hour.  He's trucking down the highway.  He's in the left hand lane, but he's not.  It's the right hand.  I'm sorry.  Right hand, left, right.  Yes.  Right hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's in the slow lane.  See what it does.  It should slow down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The weird thing is that apparently several people have reported this happening or it goes into the turn lanes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes off the road.  At least it's following a road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like it's taking exits, but that's very strange behavior and a little discombobulating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, remember-  The discussion we've had on the show is that if a full self-driving car causes an accident,  presumption is that the software maker is the one liable.  Now in this case, if you allow your car to be driven by Elon Musk-  He didn't want to take that exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  He just took an exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elon knows better.  He knows this is the road not taken that you should take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Google's philosophy from watching people actually use self-driving cars has been that  they rapidly start to assume the car has got everything covered and they'll start eating and applying cosmetics and stuff.  I think that changed Google's philosophy where they started to say,  get off the highway and start thinking about how do you drive on city streets and handle every different set of circumstances.  I hope that people don't assume, oh, the Tesla's got it.  I can just sort of zone out and then next thing you know, you're down the exit ramp and heading somewhere new on an adventure.  We'll see.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might ask.  And I see a problem already with the name.  This is out of beta.  This is a home for people who love art, entertainment, and journalism on the web.  Every member can share one link a day.  Are you using this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did for a few days.  I used it.  Nice people started it.  It's just one of those things that I just, I get in the habit of it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the problem is there's too many new things.  I don't need so many new things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's too many things to recommend to me.  I already have too much to read.  I don't need more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nuzzle, I think is a little more interesting.  I love Nuzzle.  The things that my friends recommend.  I think Nuzzle, I think Jonathan's done a great job with it.  The thing about Nuzzle is I'm so active socially that a lot of what Nuzzle tells me I've already seen because I'm active socially.  So it needs to put some more weird filters on it to give me a few surprises, but it's still very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an idea.  Why don't we create a new video network?  We could call it GBS that is branded content for advertisers.  This is from CNN.  I've been making this sound so attractive.  Is this all ads all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, it's not.  It's but it's they sent me the press release.  May I do a dramatic reading?  Yes, go ahead.  What is great big story?  Great big story is a socially distributed video network that covers real stories.  Great big ones, but it's not a news network.  Great big story seeks out awesome untold and inspirational stories about new frontiers, the human condition, planet Earth, tastes and flavors.  I just want to puke and flavors.  Tastes and flavors?  Silver screen quality with mobile in mind.  Our stories will intrigue and excite everywhere you watch video from Facebook and YouTube to Apple News to Roku and Apple TV.  It doesn't have a website.  Videos and shouty lists.  It's time to feed your feed with great big stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is like Vice and Buzzfeed where they don't have a home.  They want to think, but it's so dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great big stories.  Will you tell infinity times infinity?  Wow.  Endless supply of great big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'm pretty sure it will not be infinity times infinity.  But OK, I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got out of this place.  The style guide has got to be amazing for this place.  So when you say that they don't have a home, that means that they don't have their own site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do have a homepage, but they want to be social, which is which is the right way to go with distribution these days.  I think I had a quantum cast today.  A Buzzfeed executive was there and I asked at one point, I said, you know, with with with with programmatic advertising,  retargeting what's so important is the data point about the user used to be that advertisers would come because they want an environment.  And the Buzzfeed guy said environments basically dead.  Forget about it.  Yes. And that means the website as a as an asset, the publication as an asset is is greatly devalued.  So what CNN is trying to do, which I applaud, is to come up with a way to do the no network network,  the distributed video that goes everywhere to finally figure it out how to take advantage of that.  But Jesus, they're trying and they're trying to be for millennials.  I think you could just see the boardroom meeting.  I think the kids will like that, don't you? Yeah, yeah, those kids go for that kind of stuff.  Let's let's give more of that. That's what the kids like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tim Cook said he was trying to explain to a nephew what a channel was.  And he says, why does anything even have a channel?  What is a channel? What does it mean even to be a channel anymore?  Channel nine, channel four, TBS, CBS.  What does that even mean? And I guess that's true in this.  It's kind of. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aren't aren't mobile apps channels? Yeah.  Like native mobile apps are still these like segmented like places that you go to get content, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, like this is this is the weird. Well, I think that the idea is you go to Facebook and you get a variety of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. BuzzFeed says BuzzFeed says we don't care if you ever come to BuzzFeed.  We're going to be we're going to encounter you and you're going to encounter us wherever Twitter and Facebook.  The other thing that I think through BuzzFeed that guy named Digby said that was, I think, really, really right.  It is what we talked about VidCon when I was at VidCon, how video becomes social tokens.  When I share something with you, it says something about me and you and our relationship.  That's what BuzzFeed enables. Right.  So the sharing isn't saying you should read this list of 27 cats.  The sharing is is is is BuzzFeed enabling and feeding and fueling the conversation.  That's what BuzzFeed is about.  That's what things like the CNN venture don't figure out.  We'll have great stories because you must like stories because that's what we do is stories.  So we'll give you more stories, but just cooler and stupider and shorter because we think you're cool and stupid and short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unlike BuzzFeed that when you share the list of 27 cats, what you're actually saying is I salute your cat love.  Yes, I salute cat love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, odd numbers do better than even numbers, he said.  What odd numbers?  Because I said he said 26 cats, I said, isn't it usually 27?  We said, well, sometimes it's 28, but odd does does very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're overthinking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I knew I got something wrong at Lifehacker.  We always did a top 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should be a top 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As you get older, you're lucky to be able to get a top nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, let's ring my chimes here.  I got the ring video doorbell.  Our sponsor today.  I love this.  I installed it myself on our home and I just think this is so cool.  Think of it's kind of like caller ID for your house.  You'll be able to install it.  I'm not a handyman.  But they give you everything you need.  The doorbell itself right here, which has a built in HD video camera plus a microphone and a speaker.  So you put this in, you take I just unscrewed my old doorbell, had two wires coming out of the door jam.  Now to this plate there, put the wires on the plates.  Very simple.  Anybody could do this.  It comes with a level.  This is the appropriate screwdrivers and drill bits and all everything you need.  By the way, this is a battery powered doorbell as well.  So you don't have to have those two wires.  If you do all the all the better, but you can charge it up once a year and it'll work on any surface.  Now, if it's a wired doorbell, it's going to ring your doorbell at home.  But what it's also going to do is attach to your Wi-Fi and then ring your doorbell wherever you are.  In fact, not just ring your doorbell.  It actually has motion detection too.  So when my doorbell rings, I can answer the doorbell.  I could say, Hi, I'm not here right now.  Could you leave the box?  Or if you're worried that it's a bad guy, this is actually my front door.  And it's actually the cleaning lady got just got there.  So she's going to go in.  But that's good because I know now when I see the doorbell ring or somebody moving outside, I know who it is.  And I can I can talk to him even if I want.  One of the advantages of this is burglaries tend to occur during the daytime, about 95 percent of them while you're at work.  And in almost every case, the bad guy rings the doorbell first to make sure you're not home.  Well, even if you're at work, you can say, hey, yeah, I'm here.  What is it? I'm in the shower right now.  I'll be right out. And that's they're they're going to leave.  They're going to go away.  And if they don't, you also have video of them anyway.  And in fact, people have in L.A.  There was an arrest based on the video doorbell picture of a bad guy coming in the door.  Oh, there's Lisa picking up her mail there.  Giant box coming in the door.  I love it. I could tell when my daughter gets home late at night, I can see who's at my door.  I can even see who's in the vicinity.  And it's so easy to install.  You're going to love it.  Ring dot com slash twig for more information.  You'll never miss a visitor. You'll never miss a package.  It actually rings all of your devices, including your tablets, your phones, your smartwatch.  I know when there's somebody at my door and I just love it.  Emotion alert. You can talk to them.  They even have a ring chime.  So if you don't have a wired doorbell, you plug in the ring chime into your plug socket and boom,  it'll it'll automatically ring and and you'll know somebody's at your door.  I never miss a call again because everything in the house goes off all at once.  You're going to love it. We've got a special deal for you.

And designed this amazing homage to like an earlier time on the web with with I mean, amazing imagery and sounds.  And just you just you just scroll through it.  It's just a whole nother era on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's drooling in an asylum somewhere now after making it.  Geez, that would drive me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of these are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just keeps going. This is how it used to be, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But nothing. None of the pages were as well put together as this.  Yeah, there's like a browser inside the browser. Is that mosaic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Catscape Navigator, it says.  Which TV show do you watch?  The Simpsons. Who'd know that? Who'd think that they were still on?  Get out, I warned you.  This is so funny.  Oh, yeah, I bet it is deep because I bet you there's a you know, you click these links.  Yeah, upgrades.  The simulated browser.  Catscape is the most advanced browser available.  Meow.

Transcript:  This is a modern web page by a Chinese woman in England who who is selling cars.  I've been trying to get her on triangulation. She says I'm very busy right now.  But this is the funniest and this is real. This is current. This is her business.  I like the retro aesthetic when it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she knows what she's doing. It's tongue in cheek.  She says there's a lecture by her online. It says it's all crap JavaScript.  It's quite this reminds me of Cameron's World a little bit, except it's it's real.  It's real. This is real, folks.  This is modern.  I'm really trying to get her on triangulation.  I don't know. I don't know what it would be like.  That's amazing. So there's two crap websites just for you.  There you go. Endless scrolling.  I launch a nuclear rocket into the UK car leasing industry.  You can trust me. I'm Ling.  Great. Isn't that great?  I like Cameron's World, too.  We're going to we're going to save both of those bookmark them for some time when you have some free time.  Oof.  And Zombo.com is still around, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. That's so great.  Matt, you got something for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah. If you're on the other end of the spectrum from the GeoCity side  and you're trying to make more of the Zombo.co side, there's a site called Libra stock dot com.  And the idea behind it is that it searches something like 30 different free sources of of pictures.  And so you can go to Libra stock.com.  Now, I can't vouch for this site.  I saw it on Hacker News like a week ago and was searching and it seems to have some pretty good stuff.  So you can search for tree or money or blog or whatever.  And it'll have little hashtags that you can click on to do searches for those terms.  But as I understand it, yeah, these pictures are free for you to use for your blog.  They're Creative Commons or I believe do whatever you want, it says.  I haven't dug all the way down, but it seems like all the ones I've searched on, they say that they're free to use.  Nice. And you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so some of this is based on stock photo sites where they give you free images and you can get those.  Oh, this is great.  It's almost like a meta search on top.  Yeah. Yeah, very nice.  Nice. It's called Libra stock at Libra stock dot com.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you might think that Facebook is the whole Internet and everything on the net is just jammed with advertising.  But but marketing land quoted a study from social makers.  I haven't heard of them.  They calculated that only three percent of news feeds is ads on Facebook.  Wow. Now compare that to most any any any magazine you get.  That's kind of run anywhere from 30 to 50 percent advertising.  Radio is 19 minutes an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Network television is 16 minutes an hour.  Twenty five percent. So that's three percent.  That's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nothing. It's nothing.  Oh, I can give you one more number today from from Digby.  I'm something forgetting.  Digby's last name from I apologize from BuzzFeed.  He said that they had calculated a BuzzFeed that people scroll eight and a half feet a day.  As tall as the tallest man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Eight and a half feet a day of scrolling.  That even seems low, doesn't it?  It seems like I've scrolled many more many more miles than that.  And miles more to scroll before you sleep.  Miles before I sleep.  Miles more to scroll before you sleep.  Oh, it's so fun to have the old gang back together.  This is a classic episode.  Oh, it was great. Really great.  Someday, Gina, you will come back to us, right?

But I will mention, you know, the Google Webmaster blog, always a good place for questions about 301 302s, HTTPS, you know, keywords, crawling JavaScript, all that sort of stuff.
