No, do tell I was columnist on the examiner when it was still in his paper and I  Was you know, I covered the the milk Moscone  Assassinations was there when Einstein became mayor and I was very positive on the Feinstein as well  But I mean once in a while I would criticize something with Diane Feinstein if you criticize her once you are the enemy  and  She and her husband Dick Blum made my life completely miserable with the publisher  Reg Murphy and I finally just said I can't do this anymore  And I found a job in New York and I had my farewell party on a Friday and that Monday Reg Murphy announces his retirement  oh, you a resignation and  Wag on the city desk said well, thanks Travis.

Transcript:  May I have a little in parentheses?  May 12 through 14th  shoreline and theater  Google I oh we already talked to Jason how he'll be going  We'll we'll do the usual I stay here while Jason goes forth and maybe you should go actually why don't you would you like to?  Sure. Yeah  Shoreline get out of here. Well, I stay here in anchor while we do the keynote  But sure we'd like to send people out because there's lots to see at Google. I oh it's always a fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  event I've not been to  An IO event for maybe four years four or five years  But even then I went to the extended because the whole media press a lot or you just just go so quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least back then it did so the way that Google does this traditionally they do a puzzle right and the puzzle was solved this week  That's how we know the dates. This is the puzzle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost as I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What am I supposed to do let me click it does something happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're supposed to solve this  Hypnotize that looks exactly like May 12 through 14

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I just love the ingenuity of engineers that Google loves to put these little and then people go  Oh, it means something but what and they solve it. It's events.google.com slash IO slash mission if you want to  Solve it. Apparently it looks like space world. Maybe it is maybe we need Mr. Neil deGrasse Tyson to solve this  Nope, I'm trying all the keystrokes  Anyway, thank goodness somebody solved it. We now know Google IOS may 12 through 14 appreciate it  We figured it out. Thank you very much  Big story of the week probably this week is Facebook yesterday publishing a way to  control off Facebook activity  The off Facebook activity tool which I would go to but when I go there  Of course, it says you got to log in and I don't have a Facebook account. So I can't really show that  I a number of people have complained about this. In fact, there was a gizmo article that says it doesn't do  profanity squat  What it does do is it decouples your Facebook account?  to third party I get I don't know collection tools  It was clear history  Which was announced or introduced two years ago the tool shows you I'm told a list of apps websites and businesses  Facebook knows you visited through things like the Facebook login the Facebook like and share buttons the tracking pixels and other  less visible features for  Developers and it gives you the option to disconnect the identifiable information  It neither deletes the information on Facebook side nor on the third party side. It just I guess stops the the flow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good thing I'm gonna go to about it's a good thing that is now going back to the third party  Instead of them just saying hey, we're wiping our hands of it from on our side of things when you delete your account  but  You still have that stuff out there from those old apps that you use to sign in with your old Facebook account that could still  Monetize off of that data some kind of way. So yeah, yeah, we're cleaning that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  EFF says well, first of all, nobody's gonna do it  In fact they in the US for example three-quarters of adults don't even know that Facebook has an ad preferences page  All right, people will listen to show no maybe because we talk about it  They also say and this tool doesn't even come close to covering all the ways Facebook collects and monetizes data about you  for instance, it doesn't give you a way to opt out of custom audiences, that's  their targeted advertising service that is  Fantastic for advertisers  As long as the burden EFF writes is on users to carefully manage multiple sets of labyrinthine privacy settings  That's a good word to describe  Facebook's privacy the privacy invasive norms of targeted advertising will remain  But Facebook and other companies whose business model relies on harvesting your data know that most users are uncomfortable with a status quo  And likely would not choose to have ads targeted at them if given a real option  EFF says that's why we need strong federal privacy safety laws in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My concern is for someone like you or me that don't have Facebook accounts  But may have previously used. Yeah, I can't get to it. We can't do anything about it  So that data is still dangling out there now granted  I've never logged in with Facebook on any of those services or whatever, but so I haven't either

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I went to look at mine because I have an account  But I don't log into it ever and I don't use it  And holy moly  I got 462 apps and websites checking on my stuff most recently as last Wednesday  That is the thing that's most eye-opening is how much of this is going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's I mean tons of journalism sites, right tons of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh, oh I know why I was like why I sell why is it you say Lauren, but it's the Google backpack

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so so some of minor but in some of them I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I really go to Zyrtec calm Jeff? Do you want to hit the moral panic button yet? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I think that as  With the entirety of cookies and everything we were we were not transparent enough about it in these industries and technology industry and  Advertising industry and media industry all of us. I put us all in that same bucket  and so more  Transparency about what we're doing why we're doing it what benefit you get out of it and so on  You know, it's like it's like Google getting rid of third-party cookies, which talked about last week  Everybody's you know, yeah, hallelujah  But then big, you know media companies are gonna be hurt badly and journalism is gonna be hurt as a result  Because more revenue is gonna go away and Google's gonna benefit and it's not as simple as it seemed  It's not it's not a clear-cut good or evil  There are reasons some of these things exist and there are benefits to people we like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go away and you've pointed out before that this is nothing this isn't even new to the internet  I mean the internet is kind of weaponized it but I remember interviewing people  30 years ago from Claritas  Talking about how you give me your zip  I could tell you what magazines you subscribe to and yeah, well probably what cars in your driveway because  And so they've they've been collecting this for decades. They just there's just a lot more data than ever before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that something to be concerned about so let me give you something it'll freak you out just because it'll be fun to freak out  Maybe you knew this I didn't know this I I was at a salon  This week  Because there was no dinner there was just cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was at the salon and  Does Chatham house so I shouldn't say who was there aware but a big ad guy said I did not know this  And then one of my students this week in our new leadership program confirmed this when I talked about in the class  That Amazon is taking to guessing what you want and sending it to you even though you don't ask what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My students said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's and if you don't want it you send it back and that's that  Back, but it's free. You know, I think I think other postal law is this solicited

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can take anything you want but is this for review purposes? Like they say would you review it or they just know they're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trying to anticipate your needs. So one of my students said we have this new one one magnificent  Just great great week the program in news innovation leadership and management degree  One of the students said yeah, she was she was thinking no about time to get my new laundry pods  I haven't gotten those in a while and boom they were there and she in fact did need them and did keep them and  Went ahead and paid for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like are they saying like hey you usually like there's a couple things that I usually buy but I don't have the subscription for  So I can see Amazon being like wait a second. I bet she's gonna want these down. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An article from last year actually two years ago from Business Insider  More people are getting sent mysterious Amazon packages two years ago  they didn't order and no one knows exactly what's going on they talked to a  Actually Daily Beast talked to a person named Nikki that unwrapped a package only to find a $25 sex toy inside  She's continued to receive that would be insulting. She's continued to see that Amazon for things  Including junk like a charging cable for a Bluetooth device  Amazon that doesn't sound like it  This must be something else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PR have sent things to me in the past and that comes in a prime box  That I know I didn't order and when you open it up  It would have just you know, some random product that they're hoping that you would review

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I asked about reviews because I think that that does happen that Amazon sellers and products will sometimes arrive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unsolicited because they want to review. All right, I've seen that happen, but just the idea of Amazon saying hey, yeah  I know you ordered these  Which is actually due now my dog probiotics once a month  I'm gonna go ahead and send that out to you and  But I don't want them to do that because I don't want them to just automatically bill me without knowing  It's the law. It's gotta be a law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not if they maybe if they don't charge you like maybe if you're supposed to say  Click I accept this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, give me some type of warning shoot me an email to say hey, we're trying out this service  You know, we think this may help you out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what if they said to you though with the note that said surprise as one of our favorite customers?  We're sending this ahead of you like in trying to get data from I'm fine with that. This is that's communication

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So common place. There's a term for it. It's called brushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brushing yeah, it's a scam  The brushings this is from last October. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is but this is not what we're talking about. Well, we are we might be though because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they know that they're being they're not random?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is talking about Amazon using its data to proactively send you things  I think she wants brushing apparently is some random third party sending you packages for fraud purposes to boost

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To game Amazon system, but how do we know that that's not what's happening with these students?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it because it was Amazon itself and there was a little note inside saying we think you need this  Do you want this if not, you can sell back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you communicate I'm fine with that but yeah, we're just really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where you got the US Postal Postal Law I believe says if something is sent to you on solicited it is yours  You can keep it. I've always thought that was the rule. That's why there was there was a company  Some time ago that did plaques  you know  Twit twit is named one of the top 25 businesses  Exactly so what they did was they would make a plaque of this  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And send it to you and then and really should get the book that this where this is announced for 50, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you but you get the plaque and then and then you're not you know  You could keep it but most people who didn't want it actually did send it back  There was prepaid you didn't lose it  He just had to go the hassle of going to drop it off somewhere or the hassle playing out front. So so at this salon  Is this major?  Ad executive he's a big deal ad executive said he's been arguing that advertising will die  It's a process dying. He said what's gonna happen here is we're gonna instead of instead of forcing upon you things you don't want  We're gonna know what you want and give you what you want and and said that way that's not a bad thing  But he also said this will freak you out  Trying to freak out here  That he said we'll know 18 months before you know that you're gonna buy a house, right? Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoshana Zuboff's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Contention and surveillance capitalism who went who just went berserk full moral panic in the New York Times this week. She's language  I'll have to read that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fear is not she says that's the end stage is where they start  Predicting your behavior and influencing your behavior because they know so what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm okay with it. Somebody gets me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Batteries in the mail and saying, you know, we think you've used enough triple-a batteries. You probably need some more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's some more. I'm fine with that if it's something that they know I use all the time, but again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, what if they send you Amazon basic batteries as opposed to Duracell batteries, then I got a problem  I like Amazon basic. I'm just saying that Duracell might be a great article

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kimber where maybe it was the times about where Amazon basic batteries come from  Yeah, it was interesting story well, but the question is are these good batteries what is it's pretty much made by the same people  In China that make all the other batteries  So I  Yeah, I mean if but you could just send it back. I don't know. I don't like the idea of stuff being sent to me  It even feels like by the way, yes, that's what Zuboff is talking about in this opinion piece in the times you are now remotely controlled  Surveillance capitalists control the science of the scientists the secrets and the truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if she's I will say that if I see enough ads for something  Yeah, it's highly likely that I will investigate it and buy it. I'll be like  You'll at least look thank God advertising works. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those Instagram style ads for like a way to well, they're really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know those work well because why because they send you ads that they know are gonna target it their target target

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you see it's about relevance. So I saw I got into a Twitter tiff yesterday  Just I just just just responded to a tweet disagreeing with it  We'll say you know what would be great if all the platforms agree  They wouldn't algorithmically recommend anything and I said then you're back to mass media. It means you have no relevance  You're gonna get bombarded with messages that don't mean that you know, and they're gonna be more desperate screaming at you  You're gonna get more clickbait. Yeah, it's gonna be worse. It's what we escaped from mass media. I hate mass media  We're not a mass and that's what we've escaped now. Is it done stupidly?  Yeah, the boots you look at follow you around for two months after you friggin bought them. That's stupid advertising  It's not surveillance advertising. It's dumb advertising and they've got to improve that  Are people using it badly sure they are but in the long run  Knowing me as an individual rather than presuming. I'm a mass can yield  Better things for me. It depends on whether you're smart or stupid about how you  Than manager. Yeah, but to outlaw it is is that's moral panic to say all the algorithms are bad  It should be outlawed is is is you gotta agree with me here. That's an example of moral panic. Hmm  You talking about and the anyone saying that though I could show you the tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All algorithmic recommendations should be banned  What's that all algorithmic recommendations we've been sorry and this dancer and answer?  the challenge  That's what was said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. No, I was just thinking about with the big game that's coming up this on Sunday  They're trying to put more ads in to the game  Yeah, they make a lot of this like two million dollars for Superboy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What game is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we can't show it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google would not take us down on YouTube for showing a Google ad  Really? I  Do like those Google ads but I'm starting to feel like they're a little manipulative. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also have a black history month on which is very good. I put both of them up on the run down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you noticed I saw this article in the verge by John Porter last week  Google's ads are  Indistinguishable from the search look at that word. Look at that word

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  20 years I've been making them to just use the word ad and there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When when I am searching I am searching I'm on a mission I'm a woman on a mission  I click my I put my search term in and I want to click the top result and that is default what people do  Yeah, but that's word is really small small. Yeah, and I know it says ad right there when you're looking  But when you're just like I need the recipe for you know, corn dogs actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why am I not getting any ads because you got the then they put you back to the other one  Maybe I'm brave

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Search for a mess a lothemia. Oh, there it is says that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google wants also wants to know where I am so they could show me my shoes  Rid of the ad when I found out where I was they said, oh no, let's go to these stores instead  Yeah, but these aren't labeled as those aren't ads. That's just map data. Yeah, you can actually buy spots on the map now  So those are ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they have on the maps now they do have ads  But does that show up in search that you can buy? I  Don't know if it shows up in search. Yeah, I'm not sure  I know it shows up  I do a lot of like like restaurants near me when I'm traveling and I noticed that I do now get ads for things  They are not I can't get  What and okay, you're not searching for things like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good one  No ads unless this Amazon result is no it's not. No, it's a most popular

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Results wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blocker think the ad blockers doing it. That's it. Are you using?  Brave then don't use I'm in chrome trying it's gonna block that. That's why I love brave

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you've blocked it, but I'm trying chrome and I'm not getting it on chrome right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the point of this article was that the type of typography now  on  on Google search results is designed so that the  Headlines they used to be different right? They used to be blue or purple or something. They're very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm sorry. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just shows how relaxed you are with us and I appreciate that coffee I may need a second cup

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. It's raining in Seattle. How long does it rain last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ten minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  morning  The snow melted two days ago did the snow all melt? Yes, the snow did melt  It was it was only there for like three days. Hey, congratulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has announced its tenth messaging service  Happy birthday to you  It's going to its double digits, baby. It's gonna unify  Gmail  G Drive hangouts chats. This will be for the G suite folk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, so but weren't non G suite people supposed to lose hangouts, but people still have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have hangouts meet and hangouts chat  That's what they did. They split it out  So the new mobile app this is comes from Kevin McLaughlin writing in the information the new mobile app  Which is currently being tested internally at Google includes  Gmail drive hangouts meet  Hangouts chat  It's sounds to me like a slack clone, but Google already has its own. It's their second slack. It's their second slack clone  Messaging service their second tenth messaging service  their second slack clone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good lord. That's so diplomatic for years. Google has had one of the more confusing collection

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't have G suite at the Peru at home  But we use hangouts and been waiting on it to die and it hasn't gone away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I use it because it's I'm on Google Fi and I don't I think it's not gonna die on fire  I hope not cuz it's the it's my message. It's the mess my SMS message. Yeah, I could use Android  Messages, but I don't because I want to work on iPhone. It's the only one that works cross-platform. All right  The unified communications app for business, what does it mean to put

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Different apps within one app  Do I do I get into the effort then say I want to do this for yeah that so if you're in slack right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  synergy  Well, the idea is it becomes the hub of all your business activity, right?  So when you're in slack if you look if you put a Google Drive link in there the documents there  You can open the document if you want to chat with somebody  By voice or video you click them and it can do that. So the idea is to merge it all into one tool  That's always running

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like my gmail when I'm in gmail I get all of my chats down one side. Yep. I have all my drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can I mean isn't that already extensions that you might have added? I know I can't  Which are which are native and which are extensions, but it's very common extension to add

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Email gmail is my center or my unified communication platform. Yeah, but now they'll have an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too much oh  I was gonna say okay. I'm gonna backtrack just a minute to the privacy conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do cuz I'm moving along at a rapid clip. So no don't I don't try to get rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna come up with our ring discussion. It's gonna come back up again. So we might as well just keep privacy is the thread here  private  This idea about Facebook with ring with all of these things telling us more I'm a huge fan of transparency  But at CES I did a conversation with a Colin Engel who is the CEO of iRobot and he pointed out to me  He was like that sounds good  But whenever we talk about our privacy features on our marketing or on the box can our sales go down?  He's like consumers don't want to think about that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just pretend it's proud. So it's not so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well in their case, I think he's actually trying he's we had a big discussion about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's selling kitty taxis in-home kitty taxis and nobody wants what if you're buying an in-home kitty taxi  You don't assume that there's any privacy implications  So raising that specter by putting it on the box people go  Well, what do you mean my iRobot is watching me and in fact it does map your house, right?  So that the kid does pushed off underneath the sofa or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when it maps your house and it like shares that data with I shouldn't say it shares that data when you  Connect it with like Google or an Amazon device to say hey go clean the kitchen  He would he actually explained to me. He's like we don't actually share the maps with them  We just take that instruction set and then tell the device where to go. So they're not giving it to way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what they have to do what Apple does  Which is you know Apple says?  When we do face recognition we only store a digital representation of your face  Which by the way is the only thing a computer can store  Oh really, you know, you don't actually take my face and put it in the phone, okay appreciate it  Yeah, thank you. So that's what Apple does Apple says we only store a digital representation your face  They also say and this is another very powerful phrase on device  I don't know if it's a powerful phrase to normal people but to people like us  Mm-hmm on device face recognition as opposed to in the cloud  recognition that's important for us and that's by the way what I robots saying but it sounds like he doesn't want to even say hey  Cuz cuz you know why doesn't he doesn't want to put his claim on the box saying all the home mapping data  We collect is stored on device that scares a lot of people  Mention that we're doing that. Yeah, I think about it that way. Okay, that's fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean and that's that's because of that that's because it's a vacuum cleaner  Possibly, but I think also people don't want it's a hard thing to think about privacy. You're like, I know I want this cool feature  And then you're like, mmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do this one this is from privacy international org an open letter to  Google to Sundar Pichai. Do you mr. Pichai we the undersigned agree with you?  Privacy see this is the sneaky we're gonna agree with you in the first sentence while we rip you a new one on the rest  Of the letter. That's what my mom you see  Cannot be offered only to those people who afford it and yet here comes the ripping  Android this by the way is kind of shameful Android partners. These are people who use Android to make devices  Even phones that are branded Google Play protect are installing  apps that cannot be deleted which can leave users vulnerable to their data being collected shared and exposed without their knowledge or  Consent these pre-installed apps can have privileged custom permissions that let them operate outside the Android security model  I always wonder when I see Facebook on my Samsung phone. I can't delete it. I can only disable it, right?  You know, what is what I don't is Facebook getting any information from that presence on my phone even if I disabled even if it's disabled

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes you wonder if there's still a call for home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah on there permissions can be defined by the app including access to the microphone camera and location without  triggering the standard Android security prompts  Users are therefore completely in the dark about these intrusions. This comes from the problem of an open platform, isn't it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, hey anybody well an Android phone. Yeah, they can set their own rules on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but but what they're asking Google to do is to not have Google say this is and you know  This it should be an AOSP Android device not a Google Android device some type of standardization  Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't it shouldn't have Google Play protect branding. It shouldn't have the Google Store on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should just be an open source device. Let's speaking of things that consumers probably won't notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right  ACLU the Afghanistan Journalists Center  Americans for democracy and human rights in Bahrain because it's really hits  The third world heavily  amnesty international and on and on and on a long list of organizations  and EFF  Signers to this  It feels like Google probably should do something  On those phones or make us make it maybe just maybe they should say hey look you're gonna do Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't be bundling this crap on here. That's what they should do. Yeah, they'll get accused. I agree with you  Sorry, Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but  You agree with me, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't hear you because I was talking over you because I didn't hear you start talking. Oh, no, no, I was just saying that's that's what they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do that was all I was gonna say. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I agree with you  Put on the history books, but I wonder you know in the unintended consequences world  Well, will somebody then come after Google and say Google is trying to control this open platform  So it's not really open trying to lock their brain all these rules and knocking it down and they're preventing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Going up there have they got in trouble for things like was it trouble there?  Because they have other like the patrolling of I'll call it patrolling of the Android Play Store  Or the Play Store rather Google Play Store or things like project trouble. Those are all efforts to control and keep the platform  Stable enough to date for everybody and it's arguably for the health of consumers. I think they're probably gonna be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's more. Yeah, I agree, but that's more the how the how the OS operates as opposed to what's allowed on it and  Okay, right. So Google gets in trouble for trying to be God because it is God  And I agree they show it and I agree smart I agree with all of that but just seeing ahead I'm gonna bet that some  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's gonna come after why not take the same approach that Google took with  Was it called material design many years ago when they tried to?  Standardize things and make it to where this is something a little more unified for every every device out there  Why not take that same approach and say hey, we don't want this type of  Back door service running or bloatware if you will and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not what privacy international is asking is completely reasonable, which is Google should say if you're gonna do a Google branded  Official Google Play version of Android you should not pre-install  Third party software allow or just your own allow others right or well  and by the way, the research paper has a long list of  Companies that are doing this  It's everybody including Google by the way. It's everybody it would be nice if you would just if Google could just say hey look if you know  It's maybe just say hey should be able to you should be able to uninstall it. I would love on my Samsung phone to be able to uninstall  Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have to deal with any of this stuff in the land of PCs, which I just don't know anymore  Do you still have the problem there that we complained about loudly in years past? Yes. Yes. You still do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is we used to have to be penurious about about  Storage space to get rid of stuff, but now that's so cheap memory so cheap, right?  It doesn't it doesn't affect us negatively in that realm of these $300 laptops have terabyte drives on them now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to point out

Yeah, they had to pull all of the social media prep for this ad  They spent huge amounts of money not just for the ad which involves Wesley Snipes and mr. Peanut  Saves him from death but dies himself in this horrible fiery wreck  Which by the way seems like a very bad idea in general but for an ad campaign  Marketing smart kidding but they had this huge social media lead-up to it, which they've now  Suspended because it was they deemed in poor taste after Kobe's untimely Kobe and all of the other eight others on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know here's a fun fact there is 11 minutes of actual action in a three-hour NFL game 11 minutes  You know what the rest of it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ads  It's not 11. It's more like 15

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well baseball has about 30 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of action, but there's only 30 seconds of interesting action. Yeah, who is the halftime show person?  It's a JLo. I don't recall. It's JLo, and I forgot the other person somebody else  I never watch half. We don't want to give you a spoiler.

I love it when Stacey gets  Yeah  Yeah, no it's gonna be good hips don't lie. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Professional darts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the ring doorbell yes, yeah, we should talk about that so the the expose of that which I take seriously  But I saw I see this and this is happens in Europe with GDPR. There's a leakage of this definition of privacy  So they share your IP address  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well they say more than that they also I know PII

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the GDPR PII

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Personally identifiable information IP address is counted as that I know and I'm saying that's absurd and then EFF picks it up  And in its list of things they shouldn't share is your IP address, and they know better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so they're not complaining about your IP address in and of itself  They're complaining about the fact that you combine your IP address with your device you didn't or device identifying aspects your name  Your name or your email address  And if you share certain geolocation and sensor data from your phone the idea and this is something that I've talked about for like  Forever since like 2012 aside PII has been it is such an obsolete  Definition in this era of being able to piece together people just from bits of data. So if you  You cannot  Any sort of data when grouped with other data can become PII and we have to  Update our legal definitions for that. Like if you think about when the New York Times did their thing about hey  This is where Donald Trump we we you know wandered around Florida based on his phones geolocation  Those are the things like you take geolocation from a set of phones you take publicly available information  Suddenly you have PII and that's the point that  Our laws haven't they haven't adapted to that and we need to get them to that place. So I  agree with Jeff that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By itself the IP addresses is basically public information because you are using as you browse around every site you go to knows  But when you pair it with other stuff it suddenly becomes an important marker of everything you do  So that's the problem, but it's still it still needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey makes an excellent point put that in the history books too that I said that but  Even then then then the problem is that if you say okay  IP with anything else can be dangerous then let us get rid of everything  It misses the practicality of a website has to know your IP address now  Why ring is sharing with a  Company in a financial relationship  I believe that should be transparent and I believe there should be they should be thinking about the benefit to the user and so on  And so on and so on so on so I you know I think the points right  But there's the risk here is just that that there's been a creeping because Stacey's right that the definition is limited  It's now crept into anything could be bad and anything to go wrong and there's no more nuanced discussion in these countries  There's no more nuanced discussion in these

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say that the issue here isn't necessarily  I mean PII is important  I would say this straight. I feel that EFF or EF. Yeah EFF was a little disingenuous by  tackling some of these because some of these third parties that are the data is being shared with are  Things to make sure your your app or your content is rendering correctly on a certain type of device  They called out like crashlytics. They called out mixed panel  Branch.io those are not  I would say they're not nefarious what they are is they are trackers and they are pulling in  A lot of data that can be used to track people individually what I think is  Really the issue though and I think they glommed on to ring everybody does this  I have crashlytics running on my site  Is  They got it on a ring because it was already in the news and people have it and blah blah blah, but  The real issue is we've built an entire ecosystem around tracking people to serve them ads and I know we we  Talk about this all the time with the way the web is  Built but this is a good time to say hey  We built a whole web based on tracking  as we  Put more computers in more places. Do we want to maybe figure out some other way to do this?  And what's what i wish isn't it?  For google's sake it's it's trying it's saying it's doing that. I don't know how  Well, it's doing that but how are they doing other than just cutting off third party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, other than that. How are they doing it? Well actually cut actually the opposite they're cutting off other mechanisms of doing this  Okay  well and but but  So is the unique user any worse than having your ip if your ip really changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no what they're saying is that unique user. It's more than just your ip. It's both you  It's sensor data from your phone. So it's like where you might be in time and space

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, i'll give you a really nasty example  I quit facebook right because I don't want facebook to track me  But if I had a ring doorbell, it doesn't matter if I have a facebook account  They still send all that information to facebook. So faith this is part of that those  What do they call them dark dossiers that facebook collects of people who are not facebook members?  I don't know what facebook would want to do with that information  But the fact that they're getting it is kind of bothering me  This is why this is the graph api. I'm this  This is really  The real problem is that this data is being collated by a variety of companies is being  Shared with multiple companies and ultimately builds quite a significant dossier on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's that that is being built shared and aggregated across so many places  and ultimately it is being used to try to  To get you to either engage or to get you to buy things and that's but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, how do you respond to jeff saying? Well, yeah, but wouldn't you rather have appropriate ads than meaningless ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would rather have  Appropriate ads when I need to have an ad but i'm not sure I need to have an ad every place like I certainly don't want to have  A different problem  But that's what i'm saying is is  We have lost sight  Of other business models that could work and maybe trained us to  Respond only to advertising I guess but if that's I am gonna i'll tell you what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what i'm not gonna have an ad in this show. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing this one for free folks no no paywall is going up right now pay up pay up  We're gonna run off here. That's it paywall. No ads on this show none zero

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there might be a little bit of mention of the last pass studio  Thing but that no no other ads  Just that no other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I did that for very long, I wouldn't have a much of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying that you shouldn't have your media content. You're different. No, and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  K dick wrote an article about a world  Where there were ads on every surface?  And we're rapidly approaching that where you can't go anywhere every on the table on the chair inside the car everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's ads and that's not well and they're also to serve what they feel would be better ads  They're pulling more and more data about people to more finely  Slice and dice their wants and needs and that is a problem  because the flip side of that the darker side of having that  those kind of dark dossiers or digital dossiers about people is they can be misused for surveillance or  To do things that are maybe a little bit more nefarious in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, but but as a consumer that's just a regular everyday consumer  Does this not put us back into position of spray and pray ads that are coming to us as we use services that we don't  Pay for whether it's television radio or whatever and all of a sudden you're hearing ads about  um a smoking patch I don't smoke but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there well, I still get I don't smoke and I still get ads for I wish stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to see drug ads at all and see them on the news channels constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to say it's because you're a man of a certain age. I imagine no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, you know what's the price we're going to pay as a consumer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, if we want to use these free services, I don't see those drug ads on as I surf the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we're gonna  Give up free services altogether and I think there's going to be a mix of these models  But I am concerned about the level of detail that's  That companies are allowed to collect and trade on people  And i'm concerned when they go  beyond advertising  To get to things like hey now let's use this to price our products a little bit more competitively. Are you saying regulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would that be bad?  That's a good thing the precious price pressure to lower the price

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, i'm talking about pressure on consumers in terms of like  Oh  They they're here. I mean, it's kind of like selling you a 20 umbrella when it's raining, right? You mean surge pricing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes both ways and I will tell you in like the smart parking kind of examples and congestion things. Yeah on average  Prices do go down  But when they go up they go up real fast isn't though that adam smith's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Invisible hand working perfectly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supply and demand do you really want the invisible hand working perfectly that assumes everyone starts out with you know, the same situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That felt so monty python s for those listening there was an invisible hand but it wasn't so  That was quick that was that was howard stern show speed I feel like I honestly feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are in late stage capitalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, and well you have the the the head of linkedin  Declaring capitalism dead as he goes to his bank and counts his billions. Yeah  He's pulling up the ladder that's all exactly bingo stacy, can I ask you two questions you should work the  In this order, please  First what is the possible use that anybody could make?  Good or bad of sensor data  And then  Second thus is what's your fear about what can be done with it?  So sensor why is it why is it being collected?  What are they what do they want to do with it?  And then what could they do with it that's bad? I guess that's maybe the better way to put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So sensor data can include things like hey is my phone in my pocket?  Is it like gyroscopic data? For example, it can be geolocation data. So where am I in the world?  Um, what am I doing? Am I walking? Am I running? Am I sitting on the couch all day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where am I get as a problem? But but  Am I sitting is that a problem? Are we all set if if you're sitting for 18 hours a day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, your health insurance company is going to say yeah, that's probably not good. All right. All right. That's fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, so granted, you know, they're  Again, I don't have problems with  With I just this data can be used  Very invisibly like people are not necessarily aware of the decisions that are being made about  The data that is being collected about them and that's a problem because they can't counteract any misassumptions or uh,  Not misassumptions. What's the word i'm looking for? What's the word? Geez false positives  Yeah, the conclusions that may not be impermeable  It's definitely  I'm like, it's a great word. It's not what i'm after but  So they they don't know  They don't know what they don't know, but they're being judged on these things  It's kind of like when you don't understand how your credit course credit score was developed and people will  and even some of the outrage against, you know, your  your  Social media profiles being used for that sort of thing and you're like well, hey, is that right?  Should we be doing that? Do we have any outside?  Correlation, you know like studies to say yeah, this actually matters or is this just somebody's bias?  Is coming into play and negatively affecting people?  These are the things i'm worried about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  vice.com  leaked documents expose the secretive market for your web browsing data  This actually, uh is is a disappointing story  Uh about a company called Avast which is a free antivirus lots of people  Used I hope they don't use it anymore  Avast got it pre-installed. I believe yeah, they acquired a company called jump shot  Uh Avast when when this free antivirus is installed on your system  tracked everything you did every program you ran every not just the websites you visited  everything  You did google searches locups of locations gps coordinates  Uh linkedin pages youtube videos porn sites  It's possible to determine from the collected data what date and time the anonymized user visited you porn and porn hub  In some cases which search terms they entered into the porn site which video they watched  It doesn't include your name. But as we well know anonymized data can often be de-anonymized if there's enough data  there  Jumpshot  Shared this and data or some of the data it knows with Expedia IBM  Intuit L'Oreal and Home Depot  Um, there's a vast market for this kind of data. I know once again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bit of vast market for that before the internet and i'm not saying that's but we got it. We got it  So good now, I mean, it's an issue going on. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah

Transcript:  Well, and that's that's more of your data being collected. So you get a better picture, right a more higher resolution  and  it's  It's cheaper to crunch it so for for to develop a high resolution profile if anyone would take a lot of time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you couldn't really do it because you just didn't have the data points  That's why if I gave you the zip they could say well  You probably subscribe to these magazines and have this kind of car  But it's only probable with a 40 or 50 or 60 probability now they can say exactly what car they know what car  They know exactly what I subscribe to they know where I am what i'm doing  I don't but I guess the real fundamental question is what are the harms of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were we upset when j. Edgar hoover like weaponized the was it the FBI? Yes for his own political ends  Yeah, I mean he told because that's what you can do with this data  Yeah, you get that level of detail  Many more people  Much less effort much less money and it's available not just to one crazy dude in power

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to anybody well, but the reason that that was bad was because he was in power  Right if he's just a marketer big deal  But it's because he could use the the the the power of the federal government

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't call avast and say hey, I really want this data on this person  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's charging for it now. Come on. Yeah, google stopped giving it away. I'm gonna make money on it  Let's be clear that I just charge I know they're charging a nuisance fee  So many people are asking for it. They're charging the fee to try to create some friction for people asking  Right a 45 dollar fee is not gonna make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but and for some jurisdictions that may cost a little bit of money for some folks  Not everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This I wonder if this will stand I would imagine there there might be some court that has something to say about this  they're charging law enforcement for  responding to search warrants and subpoenas seems to me you  If if the if a cop came to my door  So we have a search warrant to search your apartment and I said that'd be 45 dollars  They might say no it won't well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if they came to your landlord and made you made them change the lock on your apartment then yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think if it's a if it's a legal subpoena

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I ran when I ran local news sites it was it was costly  Yeah, uh the worst we got was was um police departments  Would constantly file search warrants and subpoenas and all kinds of stuff. You don't want frivolous ones somebody  No, no, no what was happening was somebody on the force was complaining about a bad captain in our forums  And so the captain would come and use all of his legal authority to come after and try to get  Whoever the miscreant who didn't like you know  that he'd shortened lunch hour and  Um, we would get tons and tons and tons of them  It was expensive because we had to do with lawyers every time and all that  So there's it's I think what google's trying to do is put a little friction up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the speculation. It apparently is legal if you uh sustain costs  To pass those costs back along  Uh google says we're not going to ask for reimbursement in life-threatening emergencies or child safety investigations. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I know i'm gonna hear the stories i'm gonna hear the stories google's making money off giving government our information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly why a lot of companies refuse to do it. They don't want that impression

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, right, but it is it is something like other companies chart like the telecommunications companies  They charge unless it's in the case of like missing children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean police chief deputy police chief in minnesota said we don't  See it impacting us too much. We're only using these warrants on major crimes and the fees seem reasonable  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlike when you go in as a journalist you try to get a foyer request and they're like it's gonna charge you  We're gonna charge you like to print out these pages and you're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook does not charge microsoft and twitter say they're legally allowed to request reimbursement  But declined to explicitly address whether they charge law enforcement for such requests cox and verizon have done so for several years according to the new  York times  So, yeah, that's that's a kind of a non-story story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  makes sense, but I brought it up because jeff wanted to understand why  it matters that these companies have this sort of level of detail about people because  there is interest in line for from law enforcement and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The powers that be but I always say government is not your protector of privacy. Government is the worst enemy of your privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't didn't do something with it  Didn't we learn from the cambridge analytical scandal how how powerful this data is and how it could be weaponized actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh and  The opposite every single person I know in this field has long made fun of cambridge analytical  They were snake oil salesmen. They were nothing  Boz's post on facebook two weeks ago just said cambridge analytical didn't have any secret sauce. They didn't know  diddly  and so the the  Um, but the media narrative is oh my god cambridge line analytical alone got trump elected  No, it was it was a sales pitch from kushner and company and they're full of junk, but that's the media narrative

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what but didn't they still get just?  I guess it is pretty common analytics though. Just to see what the temperature or or or the mood of a particular  Demographic is during a certain period. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and and you know, this is the this is the two-edged sword here  Um that uh  The platforms were getting a lot of crap for not opening up data  And and and and it was people loved the fact they had a platform  And it was all everybody saw that at the time is a good thing. It was a wonderful thing  Oh, I can go use this platform and and and we want to free academics. Oh, it's cambridge university for god's sakes  academics fine and um the unintended consequence see my favorite example of this  of late  This is a benedict evans point that he made in his newsletter, which I highly recommend. I think ben's brilliant at this stuff  um  When the linkedin decision came out what a year ago saying that that linkedin tried to stop scraping of linkedin  Oh, yeah, I remember that and the court case said no  It's it's basically been made public to this extent that it's there and however I get at it  I can get at it and I can scrape and everybody said hallelujah freedom of the net wonderful thing  Well, then when the new york times did its expose  Of oh my god, they're scraping your photos and using them  The linkedin decision enables that right? So there's always going to be an  Equal reaction in these cases and people are going to find things to exploit  And so that the problem I have is the if we only did this one thing we'd solve the problem  Is always simplistic and dumb it doesn't it doesn't deal with  The potential misuse that continues the unintended consequences the intended consequences, right? Um and all that so

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a moral panic for you. Oh  The interior department  The u.s department of interior  Is adopting a no-fly rule aimed at drones made in china  Or with chinese parts. I defy you to find a drone that is not made in china  Not a one period  Uh now this isn't that's I mean you can't fly it and it means though that the government  Will stop flying drones for the most part and that could be a big problem because drones save lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, you know and they actually help get work done. Yeah, they save money cinematic stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just interior officials recorded 10 000 drone flights in 2018, Alaska, hawaii, oregon and california  That was double the number of the year before  It saved at least 14 million dollars by using drones instead of helicopters or airplanes not to mention  Safety. Yep  People die as we know die in helicopters and airplanes  U.s force service firefighter died in march in a helicopter crash in texas  Now we're going to be putting people back in harm's way said an interior department firefighter based in alaska  It's a real step back for us. Oh, but thank goodness the chinese won't be able to see  Our forests  Uh, I guess the theory is chinese made drones are somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spying on us. Yeah, the worry is  spying our back doors, I will say that a lot of people use drones for like  Running for oil pipelines and tracking like for leaks and such like that along valuable infrastructure  So is it secret exactly that those things are there? I don't think so. No, but you know having  Having a more detailed view. I mean, I think we're a little paranoid, but I also think  the data is out there chinese manufacturer dji makes the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most popular top of the line drones. It's the drones the matrice line use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The matrice line is really big phantoms and uh, and all those are companies. I use autel. They're another chinese company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Uh dji said it's disappointed that the new interior policy quote  Inappropriately treats a technology's country of origin as a litmus test for its performance security and reliability  They say it's a politically motivated agenda reduce market competition and support domestically produced drone technology regardless  Where those domestic?  Uh, we're gonna have to create a uh, we're gonna have to get going and create a domestic drone industry  Shoot us an email here at twit. Please parrot is parrot in the  I thought parrot was chinese also there they were the first drones, you know quadcopters I saw  um, but I yeah, but they are I mean  yeah, is this it seems to me like  I understand the security issue, but uh, boy, it just feels like it's more about politics than anything. It's very very 100  It's um harassment. Yeah  By doing this, I hope it does policy isn't based on policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When policy is based on self-interest whether national or personal  um  It's french. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem parrot is french  That's the policy based on personal. I do not want any french drones flying over our oil pipelines  I want liberty drones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It still be chinese. Yeah, they still we're back to that again. Yeah  Even with this whole banning if you will it one would would say hey  Well, maybe this will spark an interest of getting something here homegrown and whatnot, but I doubt it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, uh interesting story about ransomware and bitcoin  Um  there  apparently was  a ransomware case  um a company  Fell victim  Company actually no, i'm sorry the the uh  the none of it government that's a province in canada  Was crippled by bitcoin ransomware in november  Uh, fortunately they were insured by a uk insurer  Which paid one point actually they negotiated down to 900 000 dollars  They were asking for 1.2 million  In bitcoin they ended up paying a 96 bitcoin  ransom  And uh, but but they didn't they didn't sit right with him  So they followed the they followed the bitcoins and this is a problem with bitcoin they're traceable  to uh  Bitfinx a major bitcoin exchange  And they say we now want to know actually this happened november the court documents have just become pollock. We want to know  Who owns those coins?  And we want them back  The document unfortunately, uh, the document trail ends december 13th  So we'll see what happens  Maybe we'll find out more but it's interesting  Because it doesn't necessarily mean the holder of those bitcoins is the person who committed the ransomware crime  In fact, I bet it's unlikely possibly they probably sold it to somebody who they brought it to bitfinx and  Tried to turn it into cash or is holding it there  But it's an important point, uh, just for you ransomware fellas out there that bitcoin is completely traceable  A little bit careful about uh about using bitcoin monero apparently is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I once sat with somebody from the federal reserve  At a I think it was a qualcomm event and they talked about how they they love bitcoin because it is traceable  Yeah, they're like, yes, it's wonderful for us.

Transcript:  That's how twitch began twitch was originally justin tv  Justin tv started with justin conn who wore a camera on his head. I loved it walked around all the time  Yeah, ijustine followed because it was justin tv. They he sheeded it too  And uh that drove a lot of traffic  That was the original reality real reality. It's interesting. It's coming back to twitch  We're you know, humans are voyeurs. We like to look at other people and see what they're doing sometimes  I think we do you okay admitted that you're walking down the street. It's night time  Windows open curtains open lit up you look in the house. You see what they're doing. You see what they're watching you watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I I normally just smelled because i'm wondering what they're cooking  Can you smell what the neighbor's cooking? What are they cooking?  I smell before I look it's true. I do that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh global effects from u.s streaming where budgets were always bigger, but they showed sold shows abroad netflix goes direct  I don't know. This is just showing the  Netflix is the uk's biggest tv channel. Is he in the uk? Is that why he keeps talking about the uk?  Half of netflix space and most of the user growth is now outside the u.s. That's only because they reach saturation in the u.s  There's a point beyond which you can't grow  In business, there are two ways to make money says jim barksdale you can bundle  Or you can unbundle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is I mean that's yeah one or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's interesting and actually ben thompson's talked about this a little bit too where we we for a long time  We wanted to unbundle everything  And disaggregate everything and then it just kind of turns around again and you start re bundling. I would argue we never really unbundled  Because real unbundling I would be able to just say I want to watch that show that show that show in that movie  Is you still have to buy it? Well, we did music we did but then we got unbundled and it's been great for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listeners did it albums aren't back. No, not albums, but but you got to subscribe to a service, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't buy a song records. What makes you say albums aren't back  Just because of the the physical form or steve jobs when he told the record companies we are going to sell singles for 99 cents  The record companies hit the roof because artists and record companies wanted you to buy the whole album  Right didn't want to sell singles of every single song they picked the hit single maybe but they didn't they wanted to sell the album  And they thought we're gonna die. Maybe they have it certainly impacted revenue, but steve said i'm doing it anyway  And there's effectively unbundled music. Yeah, but people still buy albums though. I mean look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And albums I would argue have gotten way more interesting. You look at like  What they had to do with lemonade? Well, I know but that's that's kind of good in my era an album was two or three hits

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true and you had to buy it  Uh, now you get the answer. He said look we gotta make yeah, we gotta make this worth people's while  We gotta sell the whole thing and I think lemonade is a very good example  Now the great unbundling is coming next the great rebundling  The great mandala it's like the big bang, you know, it just it's a cycle  Is that a tech company or a tv company using a new channel? Okay commerce commerce  So stay on that for a second if you would stay on there for a second, right? Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this is my argument that the internet is not a medium that media become part of the internet  Along with every other sector that the internet as a as a connecting machine and data machine becomes encompassing  So then then the the joke that everybody wants to be a tech company  Because they thought they had some software  I I was wrong, you know in my conceptualization of that argument or the argument was wrong  But now every company is a tech company because we're all tech. Yes  right, right  so so what  This week at google is thus about everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, does that mean we should talk about google again? Is that what we're trying to get back to?  I'm just asking for a friend. I'm just asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let us talk about what about the spectrum. What about the spectrum?  It's time for the google change  Log  The google change log i don't have a dog in this and i'm doing this show for free  I don't care. I'll talk about whatever you want. I don't care. I got a headache. Let's go home on us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, i'm not  I'm just i'm like i'm feeling less articulate over time  And I wasn't great to begin with welcome to the club

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google drive can now be used as a progressive web app now  You have to be using a browser that understands that and you can  Then click a download link and it will be able to work offline. It'll be an app  Which is kind of cool that actually google's been doing this all along. I didn't realize this  Google's been the number one proponent of progressive web apps the idea that a web page could have  Could be in effect installed on a computer or a mobile device  That service workers in the browser would keep it running even when it was offline  Uh, this is good for chromebooks, which is why google's  All in on this, uh, but it's also handy for you know  Anybody who wants to work offline in drive apps like docs and sheets still open up unfortunately  In the browser, so they're gonna have to get those kind of was nothing burger. No, the drive is there though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, but every time I click on anything on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I so I have it open right now. It has to go to the web because you're not storing the data yet  Yeah, so  Nothing burger. Well, here's a good example youtube music is now a pwa  Doesn't mean the entire library of songs is downloaded. Yeah, but but the app itself is and if you have cashed songs  Well, if you have cashed material, it's offline performance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can do that without pwa on on drive. All my stuff is offline. Well, that's the first  I have no registry. I have all  I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just rub it in rigid it rub it in. Well, I have a coupon to our local  Ice cream store. They just sent me on my apple watch. So i'll see y'all later. All right  Stadia is a pwa photos is a pwa messages is  Why do I like pwas but I love pwas. I love the notion  All right. Yeah, I mean well, it's kind of silly to have something that requires online access to be a pwa  But you could in theory have cached many of them. I actually download all my google drive docs  So that they're on my hard drive most power users do yeah, it's faster that way  You hit that you nailed on the hit on the head on the hail of the net  Of the thing  Where's the rest of the change? Like oh here it is. Google is killing  What's next on the block?  Google won today. I don't even know no one no one knew it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like act blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I guess isn't it push it that much  It was an easy way to support non-profit causes showing how money that was donated was actually going to be used  Oh, this is a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember it being announced but they didn't necessarily push it probably spent an hour on another show saying this is perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The wonderful I think I remember actually it was a pick of the week at one point  The problem is google did nothing to promote it exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What google just threw a new service over the wall and didn't talk to anybody about it  What no  So if you're technically brilliant or useful solution that that they don't help people learn how to use

Although uh, oh that dooms the speakers  The speakers aren't great  I think it's pretty good. It's not bad for the size, but I would like maybe  some uh  interface  To a better stereo or something like that.

Transcript:  So I went through it  I put that up and I went I went through the very long homepage  And they do have links to the new york times the washington post cnn guardian the nation  But that's all in my view a cloak  For them to have links to daily caller bright bart  The sun washington examiner newsmax the blaze  Of fox of course and washington times are those all murdoch properties. No, they're not properties, but they're um  Murdoch worldview far. Yes. Thank you very much. Well said well said so is this crypto far right?

Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think that on a coin given the logic of ap style not giving the oxford comma because of like  Type setting rules and the pain of actually dealing with more  Type I feel that imprinting a coin kind of follows the same rules. So it's kind of justifiable  stacy
